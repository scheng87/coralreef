How local impacts scale up across affected regions depends on numerous factors, including patchiness in coral mortality, metabolic effects of extreme temperatures on populations of reef-dwelling species(4) and interactions between taxa. Here we use data from before and after the 2016 mass bleaching event to evaluate ecological changes in corals, algae, fishes and mobile invertebrates at 186 sites along the full latitudinal span of the Great Barrier Reef and western Coral Sea. One year after the bleaching event, reductions in live coral cover of up to 51% were observed on surveyed reefs that experienced extreme temperatures; however, regional patterns of coral mortality were patchy. Consistent declines in coral-feeding fishes were evident at the most heavily affected reefs, whereas few other short-term responses of reef fishes and invertebrates could be attributed directly to changes in coral cover. Nevertheless, substantial region-wide ecological changes occurred that were mostly independent of coral loss, and instead appeared to be linked directly to sea temperatures. Community-wide trophic restructuring was evident, with weakening of strong pre-existing latitudinal gradients in the diversity of fishes, invertebrates and their functional groups. In particular, fishes that scrape algae from reef surfaces, which are considered to be important for recovery after bleaching(2), declined on northern reefs, whereas other herbivorous groups increased on southern reefs. The full impact of the 2016 bleaching event may not be realized until dead corals erode during the next decade(5,6) . However, our short-term observations suggest that the recovery processes, and the ultimate scale of impact, are affected by functional changes in communities, which in turn depend on the thermal affinities of local reef-associated fauna. Such changes will vary geographically, and may be particularly acute at locations where many fishes and invertebrates are close to their thermal distribution limits(7).",9,"10.1038/s41586-018-0359-9",2018,"Stuart-Smith, Rick D.",1,"Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas","Australia"

We found that seabird densities and nitrogen deposition rates are 760 and 251 times higher, respectively, on islands where humans have not introduced rats. Consequently, rat-free islands had substantially higher nitrogen stable isotope (delta N-15) values in soils and shrubs, reflecting pelagic nutrient sources. These higher values of delta N-15 were also apparent in macroalgae, filter-feeding sponges, turf algae and fish on adjacent coral reefs.

Thus, rat eradication on oceanic islands should be a high conservation priority as it is likely to benefit terrestrial ecosystems and enhance coral reef productivity and functioning by restoring seabird-derived nutrient subsidies from large areas of ocean.",9,"10.1038/s41586-018-0202-3",2018,"Jennings, Simon",5,"Int Council Explorat Sea, Copenhagen","Denmark"

When abundant, seabirds feeding in the open ocean transport large quantities of nutrients onto islands, enhancing the productivity of island fauna and flora(3,4). Whether leaching of these nutrients back into the sea influences the productivity, structure and functioning of adjacent coral reef ecosystems is not known. Here we address this question using a rare natural experiment in the Chagos Archipelago, in which some islands are rat-infested and others are rat-free. We found that seabird densities and nitrogen deposition rates are 760 and 251 times higher, respectively, on islands where humans have not introduced rats. Consequently, rat-free islands had substantially higher nitrogen stable isotope (delta N-15) values in soils and shrubs, reflecting pelagic nutrient sources. These higher values of delta N-15 were also apparent in macroalgae, filter-feeding sponges, turf algae and fish on adjacent coral reefs. Herbivorous damselfish on reefs adjacent to the rat-free islands grew faster, and fish communities had higher biomass across trophic feeding groups, with 48% greater overall biomass. Rates of two critical ecosystem functions, grazing and bioerosion, were 3.2 and 3.8 times higher, respectively, adjacent to rat-free islands. Collectively, these results reveal how rat introductions disrupt nutrient flows among pelagic, island and coral reef ecosystems. Thus, rat eradication on oceanic islands should be a high conservation priority as it is likely to benefit terrestrial ecosystems and enhance coral reef productivity and functioning by restoring seabird-derived nutrient subsidies from large areas of ocean.",9,"10.1038/s41586-018-0202-3",2018,"MacNeil, M.

We identify 15 bright spots and 35 dark spots among our global survey of coral reefs, defined as sites that have biomass levels more than two standard deviations from expectations. Importantly, bright spots are not simply comprised of remote areas with low fishing pressure; they include localities where human populations and use of ecosystem resources is high, potentially providing insights into how communities have successfully confronted strong drivers of change. Conversely, dark spots are not necessarily the sites with the lowest absolute biomass and even include some remote, uninhabited locations often considered near pristine(6). We surveyed local experts about social, institutional, and environmental conditions at these sites to reveal that bright spots are characterized by strong sociocultural institutions such as customary taboos and marine tenure, high levels of local engagement in management, high dependence on marine resources, and beneficial environmental conditions such as deep-water refuges.

Less clear is how temperate viruses, which coexist and replicate with their host, influence microbial communities. Here we show that virus-like particles are relatively less abundant at high host densities. This suggests suppressed lysis where established models predict lytic dynamics are favoured. Meta-analysis of published viral and microbial densities showed that this trend was widespread in diverse ecosystems ranging from soil to freshwater to human lungs.

Here we show that steadily rising SSTs, not ocean acidification, are already driving dramatic changes in the growth of an important reef-building coral in the central Red Sea. Three-dimensional computed tomography analyses of the massive coral Diploastrea heliopora reveal that skeletal growth of apparently healthy colonies has declined by 30% since 1998.

The 20 p.p.m.v. increase of atmospheric CO2 and the small decrease in delta C-13 of about 0.05 parts per thousand during the later Holocene can mostly be explained by contributions from carbonate compensation of earlier land-biosphere uptake and coral reef formation, with only a minor contribution from a small decrease of the land-biosphere carbon inventory.",118,"10.1038/nature08393",2009,"Leuenberger, Markus",6,"Univ Bern, Inst Phys, CH-3012 Bern","Switzerland"

The assumption of non-interacting species leads to a sampling theory for the RSA that yields a simple approximation at large scales to the exact theory.

"542",1725,"Thresholds and the resilience of Caribbean coral reefs","NATURE","STABLE STATES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MORTALITY; DYNAMICS; ECOSYSTEMS","The deteriorating health of the world's coral reefs threatens global biodiversity, ecosystem function, and the livelihoods of millions of people living in tropical coastal regions(1). Reefs in the Caribbean are among the most heavily affected(2,3), having experienced mass disease-induced mortality of the herbivorous urchin Diadema antillarum(4) in 1983 and two framework-building species of coral(5). Declining reef health is characterized by increases in macroalgae. A critical question is whether the observed macroalgal bloom on Caribbean reefs is easily reversible. To answer this question, we must resolve whether algal-dominated reefs are an alternative stable state of the ecosystem or simply the readily reversible result of a phase change along a gradient of some environmental or ecological parameter(6). Here, using a fully parameterized simulation model in combination with a simple analytical model, we show that Caribbean reefs became susceptible to alternative stable states once the urchin mortality event of 1983 confined the majority of grazing to parrotfishes. We reveal dramatic hysteresis in a natural system(7,8) and define critical thresholds of grazing and coral cover beyond which resilience is lost. Most grazing thresholds lie near the upper level observed for parrotfishes in nature, suggesting that reefs are highly sensitive to parrotfish exploitation. Ecosystem thresholds can be combined with stochastic models of disturbance to identify targets for the restoration of ecosystem processes. We illustrate this principle by estimating the relationship between current reef state (coral cover and grazing) and the probability that the reef will withstand moderate hurricane intensity for two decades without becoming entrained in a shift towards a stable macroalgal-dominated state. Such targets may help reef managers face the challenge of addressing global disturbance at local scales.",430,"10.1038/nature06252",2007,"Mumby, Peter J.",1,NA,NA

We also show the importance of the early onset of active larval movement mediating the dispersal potential. In addition to self -recruitment, larval import from outside the local area is required to sustain most populations, although these population subsidies are very limited in particular systems. The results reveal distinct regions of population isolation based on larval dispersal that also correspond to genetic and morphological clines observed across a range of marine organisms.",825,"10.1126/science.1122039",2006,"Srinivasan, A",3,NA,NA

"649",1751,"Long-term relationships between ecological stability and biodiversity in Phanerozoic reefs","NATURE","CORAL-REEFS; DIVERSITY; PRODUCTIVITY; EXTINCTIONS; ENVIRONMENT; RESILIENCE","High biodiversity has been shown to enhance ecological stability on small spatial scales and over intervals of weeks to decades(1-4.) It remains unclear, however, whether this diversity - stability relationship can be scaled up to regional scales, or to longer timescales(5). Without empirical validation at larger scales, the implications of the diversity - stability relationship for both ecology and long-term conservation strategies cannot readily be resolved. Here I show that in biogenic reefs, ecological stability is related to taxonomic diversity on million-year timescales. The higher the mean reef diversity in a particular time interval, the smaller the change in skeletal density, style of reef building and biotic reef types in the subsequent time interval. Because the relationships apply to a wide spectrum of disturbance regimes and reef types, these results support the hypothesis that species richness itself promotes ecological stability(3). Carbonate production by reefs, while closely correlated with reef diversity without temporal lag, is not stabilized by reef diversity over these long timescales. This suggests that ecological stability and productivity may be decoupled in natural ecosystems.",53,"10.1038/nature03152",2005,"Kiessling, W",1,NA,NA

"738",1767,"Predicted recurrences of mass coral mortality in the Indian Ocean","NATURE","REEFS; RECOVERY; FUTURE; EVENT","In 1998, more than 90% of shallow corals were killed on most Indian Ocean reefs(1). High sea surface temperature (SST) was a primary cause(2,3), acting directly or by interacting with other factors(3-7). Mean SSTs have been forecast to rise above the 1998 values in a few decades(2,3); however, forecast SSTs rarely flow seamlessly from historical data, or may show erroneous seasonal oscillations, precluding an accurate prediction of when lethal SSTs will recur. Differential acclimation by corals in different places complicates this further(3,7,8). Here I scale forecast SSTs at 33 Indian Ocean sites where most shallow corals died in 1998 (ref. 1) to identify geographical patterns in the timing of probable repeat occurrences. Reefs located 10-15degrees south will be affected every 5 years by 2010-2025. North and south from this, dates recede in a pattern not directly related to present SSTs; paradoxically, some of the warmest sites may be affected last. Temperatures lethal to corals vary in this region by 6degreesC, and acclimation of a modest 2degreesC by corals could prolong their survival by nearly 100 years.",232,"10.1038/nature01987",2003,"Sheppard, CRC",1,NA,NA

"755",1769,"Global trajectories of the long-term decline of coral reef ecosystems","SCIENCE","CLIMATE-CHANGE; BELIZE; DISEASES; ECOLOGY; FUTURE; SCALE","Degradation of coral reef ecosystems began centuries ago, but there is no global summary of the magnitude of change. We compiled records, extending back thousands of years, of the status and trends of seven major guilds of carnivores, herbivores, and architectural species from 14 regions. Large animals declined before small animals and architectural species, and Atlantic reefs declined before reefs in the Red Sea and Australia, but the trajectories of decline were markedly similar worldwide. All reefs were substantially degraded long before outbreaks of coral disease and bleaching.

Highstands of sea level can be reconstructed from dated fossil coral reef terraces(6,7), and these data are complemented by a compilation of global sea-level estimates based on deep-sea oxygen isotope ratios at millennial-scale resolution(8) or higher(1). Records based on oxygen isotopes, however, contain uncertainties in the range of +/-30 m, or +/-1degreesC in deep sea temperature(9,10).

We then use a hydraulic model of the water exchange between the Red Sea and the world ocean to derive the sill depth and hence global sea level-over the past 470,000 years (470 kyr). Our reconstruction is accurate to within +/-12 m, and gives a centennial-scale resolution from 70 to 25 kyr before present.
