14,Population Dynamics of Benthic-Epiphytic Dinoflagellates on Two Macroalgae From Coral Reef Systems of the Northern Mexican Caribbean,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,2018,PROROCENTRUM DINOPHYCEAE; SP-NOV; SEASONAL-CHANGES; TWIN-CAYS; CIGUATERA; GAMBIERDISCUS; OSTREOPSIS; TOXICITY; BELIZE; ASSEMBLAGES,"In the present study the abundance of epiphytic dinoflagellates was evaluated at two coral reef sites of the natural protected areas, Arrecife de Puerto Morelos and Isla Contoy, located in the northern Mesoamerican Reef System of the Mexican Caribbean. Abundances were monitored from April to December, 2015 on two genera of macroalga belonging to different functional groups: Dictyota and Amphiroa. In general, the total abundance of dinoflagellates was higher in Puerto Morelos on both macroalgae. Ostreopsis cf. marina and O. heptagona were the dominant species. Relative abundance of these species varied from 8 to 99% of total epiphytic dinoflagellates. Maximum abundances at Puerto Morelos were registered in April, with 33,801 cells.g(-1) on Dictyota and 6,264 cells.g(-1) on Amphiroa. In Isla Contoy the maximum abundance was 16,006 cells.g(-1) and it was detected on Dictyota during December. Other dinoflagellate genera were more abundant during the warmer period (May-September) in both locations. Prorocentrum was the second most abundant genus and was represented by six species (P. hoffmannianum, P. lima, P. belizeanum, P. elegans, P. emarginatum, and P. rathymum). The maximum pooled abundance of Prorocentrum species was 4,144 cells.g(-1) on Dictyota in August. Coolia spp. did not reach abundances higher than 1,000 cells.g(-1) and Gambierdiscus spp. only exceeded 100 cells.g(-1) during August. Mean water temperature in Isla Contoy was significantly lower than that of Puerto Morelos during the entire study period. There was a negative correlation between the water temperature and the abundance of O. cf. marina. The dominance of Ostreopsis in the Caribbean is significant because of its capability to produce palytoxin analogs and its potential role in ciguatera fish poisoning outbreaks in the region. This is the first study that reports blooms of Ostreopsis in Mexican Caribbean coral reefs, a fact that emphasizes the significance of this genus at global scale.","",Tropical Atlantic,0,10.3389/fmars.2018.00487,Field-based,"Ctr Invest Cient Yucata, AC Unidad Ciencias Agua, Lab Ecol Costera, Cancun",Mexico,Mexico

Despite the trend of increasing studies concerning the MCEs, the reproductive traits of MCE Indo-Pacific octocorals have remained uninvestigated to date. The current study engages with two common zooxanthellate octocorals in the northern Red Sea: the internal-brooder Ovabunda spp. and the surface-brooder Rhytisma fulvum fulvum. It addresses the hypothesis that, similar to their shallowzone conspecifics, the upper mesophotic populations also reproduce sexually. We analyze the reproductive traits of tropical, upper mesophotic octocoral populations and compare them for the first time to the traits of their conspecifics on shallow reefs. In addition, we discuss the timing of surface-brooding events in relation to lunar phase and daily seawater temperature. The populations of Ovabunda spp. in the upper MCE and shallow-water display several similar reproductive traits (e.g., maximal gonad diameter and fecundity). Consequently, this species seems to be a successful depthgeneralist. In contrast, the reproductive features of R. f. fulvum differ between the reefs in the upper MCE and in those shallow-water, with a decreased abundance of female colonies, lower fecundity, and a lower percentage of colonies exhibiting surfacebrooding in the former. It thus seems that the R. f. fulvum population encounters certain constraints in the MCE that may, in turn, lead to its reduced reproductive performance there. In addition, surface-brooding events for R. f. fulvum in the uppermesophotic zone and in shallow-water were separated by two weeks. Since a distinctive seawater temperature rise preceded each surface-brooding event, temperature regimes at different depths may present extrinsic cues that influence the timing of reproduction. The findings from this study contribute to our understanding of the life-history of mesophotic benthic inhabitants in general and of octocorals in particular. Overall, the current findings reinforce the viewpoint that the refuge potential of MCEs may be reflective of species-specific reproductive traits.","","",0,10.3389/fmars.2018.00445,Field-based,"Interuniv Inst Marine Sci Eilat, Elat",Israel,Israel

18,High species richness and lineage diversity of reef corals in the mesophotic zone,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,2018,GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; TEMPORAL PATTERNS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HYPOTHESES,"Coral reefs are increasingly threatened by thermal bleaching and tropical storm events associated with rising sea surface temperatures. Deeper habitats offer some protection from these impacts and may safeguard reef-coral biodiversity, but their faunas are largely undescribed for the Indo-Pacific. Here, we show high species richness of scleractinian corals in mesophotic habitats (30-125 m) for the northern Great Barrier Reef region that greatly exceeds previous records for mesophotic habitats globally. Overall, 45% of shallow-reef species (less than or equal to 30 m), 78% of genera, and all families extended below 30 m depth, with 13% of species, 41% of genera, and 78% of families extending below 45 m. Maximum depth of occurrence showed a weak relationship to phylogeny, but a strong correlation with maximum latitudinal extent. Species recorded in the mesophotic had a significantly greater than expected probability of also occurring in shaded microhabitats and at higher latitudes, consistent with light as a common limiting factor. The findings suggest an important role for deeper habitats, particularly depths 30-45 m, in preserving evolutionary lineages of Indo-Pacific corals. Deeper reef areas are clearly more diverse than previously acknowledged and therefore deserve full consideration in our efforts to protect the world's coral reef biodiversity.","",Central Indo-Pacific,0,10.1098/rspb.2018.1987,Field-based,"Queensland Museum, Biodivers & Geosci, Townsville, Qld 4810",Australia,Australia
19,Maneuvering towards adaptive co-management in a coral reef fishery,MARINE POLICY,2018,COMMUNITY-BASED MANAGEMENT; MARINE PROTECTED AREAS; GOVERNANCE; CONSERVATION; RESOURCES; FRAMEWORK; IMPACTS; SUCCESS; MOOREA; HAWAII,"Tropical coral reef ecosystems in the Pacific region are degrading rapidly as ocean temperatures rise and local anthropogenic stressors increase. In this context of rapid change, effective site-based management of coral reef fisheries necessitates flexible environmental governance that is closely attuned to the needs of multiple stakeholders who depend on the fishery for income, food, and cultural identity. As such, many practitioners and scholars call for adaptive co-management of coral reef fisheries where local resource users play a primary role in environmental governance with the support of flexible institutions that operate across organizational scales. This article describes the history and evaluates the current status of marine governance in Moorea, French Polynesia. Established in 2004, the management framework is under revision because it has failed to meet its ecological objectives and has generated discontent among many stakeholders. Drawing on household surveys, interviews, and archival information, the challenges to as well as the factors that may enable a more successful transition of the current governance arrangement towards co-management are detailed. It is argued that recent social mobilization, subsistence and cultural links to the fishery, the presence of geographically and socially relevant traditional governance boundaries, and the implementation of co-management in other parts of French Polynesia are positive factors. However, lack of trust between stakeholders, social heterogeneity, disruption of traditional cultural institutions and practices, minimal institutional support, and an uncertain legal framework suggest that there are significant headwinds for maneuvering towards successful co-management in Moorea.","",Eastern Indo-Pacific,0,10.1016/j.marpol.2018.09.016,Field-based,"San Diego State Univ, Dept Anthropol, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego",United States,French Polynesia

Over two 10-day periods, we tagged and photographed feeding scars on colonies of the tabulate coral Acropora spicifera that harboured Drupella feeding aggregations.

However, anemonefish community structure has seldom been investigated in high-latitude areas. To understand the mechanism underlying species diversity of anemonefish in the northern limits of their distribution and to compare with previous results from tropical and other areas, we investigated the community structure of anemonefish around the western coast of Okinawa-jima Island, Japan. Seven species of host anemones and six species of anemonefish were distributed across the 12 study sites. The diversity index of anemonefish and the host anemone varied among sites; anemonefish diversity increased with diversity of host anemones, which was associated with the ratio of sandy areas and distance from shore. The density of each species of anemonefish increased with the density of the primary host anemone, which suggests that niche differentiation may be occurring. However, results of two species of host anemone (Stichodactyla mertensii, Heteractis magnifica) associated each with two species of anemonefish did not support the niche differentiation hypothesis. Forty-seven percent of S. mertensii were shared by Amphiprion clarkii and A. sandaracinos simultaneously, supporting the cohabitation hypothesis. Amphiprion ocellaris and A. perideraion used the same host H. magnifica, but never shared a host simultaneously. Moreover, anemone size and water depth did not differ between the two anemonefish species, suggesting the possibility of the lottery model. In subtropical Okinawa, 86.7% of species interactions supported the niche differentiation hypothesis, 6.7% supported the cohabitation hypothesis, and 6.7% supported the lottery hypothesis. The mechanisms of coexistence of anemonefish in subtropical regions include not only niche differentiation and cohabitation but also the lottery hypothesis, which has not been reported in tropical regions.","",Eastern Indo-Pacific,1,10.1007/s00338-018-01740-1,Field-based,"Univ Ryukyus, Grad Sch Engn & Sci, 1 Senbaru, Nishihara, Okinawa 9030213",Japan,Japan
25,Holdfasts of Sargassum swartzii are resistant to herbivory and resilient to damage,CORAL REEFS,2018,GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; CORAL-REEF; MACROALGAL HERBIVORY; SEASONAL-CHANGES; PHASE-SHIFTS; KANEOHE BAY; DIVERSITY; DYNAMICS; ALGAE; REGENERATION,"The importance of herbivory in both preventing and reversing shifts to macroalgae dominance on coral reefs has been extensively investigated. However, most studies examining the capacity for herbivores to consume fleshy macroalgae (e.g., Sargassum) have investigated removal of the leafy' biomass without considering the susceptibility of other components of the macroalga, in particular the holdfast, to herbivory. Here, we investigate the susceptibility of Sargassum components (blades, stipes and holdfasts) to herbivory and investigate the capacity for Sargassum to regrow following damage to the holdfast. We placed entire thalli of Sargassum swartzii on the reef crest at Lizard Island, northern Great Barrier Reef, for 24d, and used photographs and video recordings to quantify rates of removal over this period. The blades of the S. swartzii were rapidly removed (100% in 2 d), whereas the stipes were less susceptible to herbivores, with 72% of experimental thalli having partial stipes remaining after 24d. Only one holdfast (out of 54) was removed during the experiment, while all of the remaining holdfasts were largely undamaged. When S. swartzii holdfasts were experimentally damaged, we found no detectable effect on thallus height or holdfast size among regrown thalli after 1 y. There was, however, a 50% reduction in survival for S. swartzii individuals when 75% of the holdfast was removed. This study shows that holdfasts of S. swartzii are extremely resistant to herbivory, and that incidental bites on S. swartzii holdfasts are unlikely to affect their growth or survival unless three-quarters of the holdfast is removed. The capacity of Sargassum to regenerate from damaged holdfasts, coupled with the low rate of herbivory on holdfasts, suggests that sustained browsing (preventing regrowth of the stipe and blades) may be more important in reversing macroalgae dominance than physical removal of holdfasts by herbivorous fishes.","",Central Indo-Pacific,0,10.1007/s00338-018-01745-w,Field-based,"James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811",Australia,Australia

In this study, we summarized the age-based biological characteristics of B. muricatum based on comprehensive surveys of a small-scale but high-yield fishery in Solomon Islands. We examined the full breadth of the life history, including pelagic larval duration, growth patterns throughout the ontogeny (post-settlement, juvenile, and adult), life span, mortality, age at maturity, and reproductive timing, as well as the size-dependent relative contribution of females to overall reproductive effort. The age-based demographic information supports a sexual pattern of functional gonochorism, whereby sex ratios were consistent throughout the lifespan. After a 25-day pelagic larval duration, the species growth pattern is comparatively slow and differs by sex, where males generally reach larger sizes at a given age than females. This growth pattern is associated with a long life span (at least 30yrs) and low mortality rates (<0.2yr(-1)). Annual and lunar tracking of ovary weights confirmed cyclical spawning activity synchronized just prior to new moon throughout the year. Surprisingly, ovary weights declined in the largest and oldest females, implying lower reproductive output. Instead, lower ovary weights may reflect alternative mating strategies among the largest females whereby spawning frequency and strategy differs among females of different body sizes. These results highlight several novel and previously unknown aspects of this species' biology, and our analyses generate information that can strengthen population models, facilitate stock assessments, support regional management, and provide a baseline for comparative work.","",Central Indo-Pacific,0,10.1007/s00338-018-1723-9,Field-based,"Pacific Otolith Serv, Honolulu",United States,Solomon Islands
29,eDNA detection of corallivorous seastar (Acanthaster cf. solaris) outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef using digital droplet PCR,CORAL REEFS,2018,OF-THORNS STARFISH; ENVIRONMENTAL DNA; PLANCI; ECHINODERMATA; CAPTURE; LIMITS; TOOL,"Coral loss through consumption by corallivorous crown-of-thorns seastars (CoTS, Acanthaster spp.) is a major contributor to the coral reef crisis in the Indo-Pacific region. The fourth wave of Acanthaster cf. solaris outbreaks since the 1960s started around 2010 on Australia's Great Barrier Reef. Ecological monitoring failed to detect early outbreak stages, thus preventing timely intervention. Here, we develop a digital droplet PCR (ddPCR)-based method to detect environmental DNA (eDNA) of CoTS in 2-l water samples that can be compared with abundances of the species recorded by divers along 200-m(2) transects. Aquarium tests demonstrated that eDNA was readily detectable and increases proportional to the biomass of CoTS (R-2=0.99, p<0.0001). Adaptation from a quantitative PCR technique developed for CoTS larvae (Doyle et al. in Marine Biology 164:176, 2017) to ddPCR improved the limit of quantification (LOQ) by a factor of 45. During field verification on 11 reefs, CoTS eDNA was detectable on all reefs suffering outbreaks. In contrast, CoTS eDNA was absent from post-outbreak' reefs after populations collapsed and from pre-outbreak' reefs. In linear models, CoTS densities explained a high amount of variance of eDNA concentrations, both for water samples taken at the depth of transects (R-2=0.60, p<0.0001) and on the sea surface (R-2=0.46, p=0.0004). The proportion of samples above LOQ was also correlated with CoTS densities, with a similar amount of variance explained as for the concentration (underwater R-2=0.68, p<0.0001; surface R-2=0.49, p=0.0004). We conclude that, after consideration of sampling locations and times, this method is promising for CoTS population monitoring and early detection of outbreaks and might supplement or replace traditional monitoring. Development of automated samplers and possibly on board PCR in the future will further improve early detection.","",Central Indo-Pacific,0,10.1007/s00338-018-1734-6,Field-based,"Australian Inst Marine Sci, PMB 3, Townsville, Qld 4810",Australia,Australia
30,Conserved behavioral circuits govern high-speed decision-making in wild fish shoals,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,2018,DENSITY-DEPENDENCE; OBJECT APPROACH; LARVAL; ESCAPE; FEAR,"To evade their predators, animals must quickly detect potential threats, gauge risk, and mount a response. Putative neural circuits responsible for these tasks have been isolated in laboratory studies. However, it is unclear whether and how these circuits combine to generate the flexible, dynamic sequences of evasion behavior exhibited by wild, freely moving animals. Here, we report that evasion behavior of wild fish on a coral reef is generated through a sequence of well-defined decision rules that convert visual sensory input into behavioral actions. Using an automated system to present visual threat stimuli to fish in situ, we show that individuals initiate escape maneuvers in response to the perceived size and expansion rate of an oncoming threat using a decision rule that matches dynamics of known loom-sensitive neural circuits. After initiating an evasion maneuver, fish adjust their trajectories using a control rule based on visual feedback to steer away from the threat and toward shelter. These decision rules accurately describe evasion behavior of fish from phylogenetically distant families, illustrating the conserved nature of escape decision-making. Our results reveal how the flexible behavioral responses required for survival can emerge from relatively simple, conserved decision-making mechanisms.","",Eastern Indo-Pacific,0,10.1073/pnas.1809140115,Field-based,"NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Santa Cruz",United States,French Polynesia
30,Conserved behavioral circuits govern high-speed decision-making in wild fish shoals,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,2018,DENSITY-DEPENDENCE; OBJECT APPROACH; LARVAL; ESCAPE; FEAR,"To evade their predators, animals must quickly detect potential threats, gauge risk, and mount a response. Putative neural circuits responsible for these tasks have been isolated in laboratory studies. However, it is unclear whether and how these circuits combine to generate the flexible, dynamic sequences of evasion behavior exhibited by wild, freely moving animals. Here, we report that evasion behavior of wild fish on a coral reef is generated through a sequence of well-defined decision rules that convert visual sensory input into behavioral actions. Using an automated system to present visual threat stimuli to fish in situ, we show that individuals initiate escape maneuvers in response to the perceived size and expansion rate of an oncoming threat using a decision rule that matches dynamics of known loom-sensitive neural circuits.

This study used baited remote underwater stereo-video systems (stereo-BRUVs) to compare species richness, fish abundance and size along 42.3 km of subsea pipeline and in adjacent areas of varying habitats. The pipeline is laid in an onshore-offshore direction enabling surveys to encompass a range of depths from 9 m nearshore out to 140 m depth offshore. Surveys off the pipeline were performed across this depth range and in an array of natural habitats (sand, macroalgae, coral reef) between 1 km and 40 km distance from the pipeline. A total of 14,953 fish were observed comprising 240 species (131 on the pipeline and 225 off-pipeline) and 59 families (39 on the pipeline and 56 off-pipeline) and the length of 8,610 fish were measured. The fish assemblage on and off the pipeline was similar in depths of <80 m. In depths beyond 80 m, the predominant habitat off-pipeline was sand and differences between fish assemblages on and off-pipeline were more pronounced. The pipeline was characterised by higher biomass and abundances of larger-bodied, commercially important species such as: Pristipomoides multidens (goldband snapper), Lutjanus malabaricus (saddletail snapper) and Lutjanus russellii (Moses' snapper) among others, and possessed a catch value 2-3 times higher per stereo-BRUV deployment than that of fish observed off-pipeline. Adjacent natural seabed habitats possessed higher abundances of Atule mate (yellowtail scad), Nemipterus spp. (threadfin bream) and Terapon jarbua (crescent grunter), species of no or low commercial value. This is the first published study to use stereo-BRUVs to report on the importance of subsea infrastructure to commercially important fishes over a depth gradient and increases our knowledge of the fish assemblage associated with subsea infrastructure off north-west Australia. These results provide a greater understanding of ecological and fisheries implications of decommissioning subsea infrastructure on the north-west shelf, and will help better inform decision-making on the fate of infrastructure at different depths.","",Central Indo-Pacific,0,10.1371/journal.pone.0207703,Field-based,"Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Crawley, WA",Australia,Australia

Marginal habitats may represent important refuges if individuals can acquire adequate resources to survive and reproduce. However, resources at range margins are often distributed more sparsely; therefore, increased effort to acquire resources can result in suboptimal performance and lead to marginal populations becoming non-self-sustaining sink-populations. Shifting resource availability is likely to be particularly problematic for dietary specialists. Here, we use extensive in situ behavioural observations and physiological condition measurements to examine the costs and benefits of resource-acquisition along a depth gradient in two obligate corallivore reef fishes with contrasting levels of dietary specialization. As expected, the space used to secure coral resources increased towards the lower depth margin. However, increased territory sizes resulted in equal or greater availability of resources within deeper territories. In addition, we observed decreased competition and no differences in foraging distance, pairing behaviour, body condition or fecundity at greater depths. Contrary to expectation, our results demonstrate that coral-obligate fishes can select high-quality coral patches on the deeper-reef to access equal or greater resources than their shallow-water counterparts, with no extra costs.

We experimentally investigated the intensity of behavioral interactions between lionfish and indigenous, abundant and economically important juvenile nGOM red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus), and other increasingly abundant juvenile tropical snapper species (gray snapper-L. griseus and lane snapper-L. synagris) in large outdoor mesocosms to examine snapper vulnerabilities to lionfish competition.

Additionally in paired trials, red and lane snapper swimming activities were significantly lower than those of lionfish, while no significant difference in swimming activities was observed between lionfish and gray snapper.

We found that regardless of acclimation temperature, juveniles maintained the same food consumption rates (similar to 5% body mass every other day), but for those living at 32 degrees C, this resulted in significantly decreased growth rates (body mass and total length). During winter months, maximum habitat temperatures (similar to 24 degrees C) are far below adult sharks' critical thermal limits (35.92 +/- 0.21 degrees C). During summer months, maximum habitat temperatures (similar to 35 degrees C) are closer to adult critical thermal limits (38.85 +/- 0.31 degrees C). When estimating thermoregulatory behaviour of juvenile sharks maintained at 28 degrees C, those sharks examined in winter exhibited no thermoregulatory behaviour, while those examined in summer actively sought to control their thermal exposure, preferring 30.7 +/- 1.04 degrees C (day) and 28.54 +/- 0.75 degrees C (night). Furthermore, after acclimation to predicted end-of-century conditions, these same sharks behaviourally sought out 32.94 +/- 0.46 degrees C (day) and 30.74 +/- 0.68 degrees C (night); despite the cost of decreased growth and/or survival. Sharks maintained in control conditions had a mortality rate of 33% during the initial 90-day period of exposure, while mortality was 100% in those sharks exposed to elevated conditions. Ultimately, as ocean temperatures continue to rise, the distribution and abundance patterns for epaulette sharks and many other coral reef species are likely to change if trade-offs associated with acclimation outweigh the benefits of moving to more favourable habitats.","",Central Indo-Pacific,0,10.1007/s00227-018-3427-7,Field-based,"Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109",Australia,Australia
39,Effect of Coral-Algal Interactions on Early Life History Processes in Pocillopora acuta in a Highly Disturbed Coral Reef System,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,2018,POSTSETTLEMENT SURVIVAL; LARVAL SETTLEMENT; PHASE-SHIFTS; HARD CORAL; COMPETITION; MACROALGAE; RECRUITMENT; SINGAPORE; GROWTH; RESILIENCE,"Scleractinian corals are vulnerable to a range of environmental disturbances, but generally suffer the highest rates of mortality during early life-history stages, i.e., from larval settlement until a few months post-settlement. Variations in survival rates of corals during this period play a key role in structuring adult coral populations. Many coral reefs have experienced reductions in herbivory rates due to overfishing and consequent increases in macroalgae, however, the effect of increased coral-algal interactions may vary between coral life-history stages and among locations. Therefore understanding the relative importance of different drivers of mortality across early life-history stages, under a range of environmental conditions, is essential to effectively manage and restore coral reefs. To date, however, relatively few studies have (a) examined coralalgal interactions across several early life-history stages (i.e., from planulae to juvenile colonies) and (b) done so in highly disturbed reefs close to large urban centers. We investigated the effect of algal-coral-herbivore interactions on early life history stages in the coral Pocillopora acute on coral reefs off mainland Singapore, a heavily disturbed ""urbanized reef environment"". Larval settlement rates were estimated in the presence of six macroalgal species ex situ. The effect of direct interaction with two macroalgal species on newly settled spat was examined in situ and the effect of reduced herbivory was tested with exclusion cages on naturally settled 9-month-old juveniles in situ. We found significant reductions in P. acuta settlement in the presence of four macroalgal species. Newly settled spat of P. acute had significantly lower survivorship when in contact with Sargassum sp. on the reef crest but not with Bryopsis sp. on the reef flat. Herbivore exclusion reduced survivorship of juvenile corals, which was associated with increased sediment accumulation, but not with algal biomass. Our results suggest coral recruitment on heavily disturbed reefs can be impacted by species-specific macroalgal effects via reduced settlement on ephemeral substrata and reduced survivorship when in direct contact with Sargassum sp. Furthermore, recruitment may be negatively impacted by reductions in herbivory, possibly via increased abundance of epilithic algal matrix leading to sediment trapping.","",Central Indo-Pacific,0,10.3389/fmars.2018.00385,Field-based,"Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Ctr Marine Bioinnovat, Sydney, NSW",Australia,Singapore

However, abiotic factors such as the complexity and orientation of the benthos often mediate the impact of herbivores on benthic communities. We experimentally evaluated the independent and interactive effects of substrate orientation and herbivorous fishes on algal community dynamics on a coral reef in the Florida Keys, USA. We created horizontal and vertical substrates, mimicking the trend in the reduction of vertical surfaces of coral reefs, to assess how algal communities developed either with herbivory (open areas) or without herbivory (herbivore exclosures). We found that substrate orientation was the dominant influence on macroalgal community composition. Herbivores had little impact on community development of vertical substrates as crustose algae dominated these substrates regardless of being in exclosures or open areas. In contrast, herbivores strongly impacted communities on horizontal substrates, with upright macroalgae (e.g., Dictyota spp., articulated coralline algae) dominating herbivore exclosures, while filamentous turf algae and sediment dominated open areas. Outside of exclosures, differences between vertical and horizontal substrates exposed to herbivores persisted despite similar intensity of herbivory. Our results suggest that the orientation of the reef benthos has an important impact on benthic communities. On vertical surfaces, abiotic factors may be more important for structuring algal communities while herbivory may be more important for controlling algal dynamics in flatter areas. Thus, the decline in structural complexity of Caribbean coral reefs and the flattening of reef substrates may fundamentally alter the impact that herbivores have on benthic community dynamics.","",Tropical Atlantic,2,10.1007/s00227-018-3411-2,Field-based,"Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 11200 SW 8th St, Miami",United States,United States

However, the effects of heatwaves may differ among geographically separated populations depending on their capacity for thermal plasticity. Here, we compared the response to simulated summer heatwave temperatures (+1.5 and +3.0 degrees C above average) in two populations of a coral reef damselfish with different capacities for thermal plasticity. We found that the more thermally tolerant population had greater plasticity of gene expression and had significantly more downregulated genes, which may provide more energy to repair damage associated with thermal stress and to maintain basic functions at these extreme temperatures. In contrast, the thermally sensitive population exhibited higher basal levels of heat shock proteins and had three times fewer changes in gene expression overall. The limited changes in gene regulation suggest that individuals have reduced genome plasticity to tolerate thermal fluctuations and consequently may not have enough energy to repair damage and resume cellular homeostasis at extreme temperatures. Thus, we have identified the molecular signatures of how two genetically distinct fish populations cope with an extreme thermal event, and why they differ in their capacity for thermal plasticity.","",Central Indo-Pacific,0,10.3389/fmars.2018.00349,Field-based,"James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excelienoe Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld",Australia,Australia

Assuming the size-dependency of patch departure behaviour, model-based approaches have shown size-mediated coexistence in systems of competing species. However, experimental evidence for the influence of body size on patch use behaviour is scarce. In this study, we explore whether allometric principles provide an underlying framework for interspecific patterns of resource use. To this end, we propose a meso-cosm approach using three species of gastropods differing in size as a model system and P-32 radio-isotopic techniques as a measure of resource use. Foragers of different size were placed in an artificial patch, provided with a limited amount of labelled resource and let them free to move as resources decrease and scarcity is sensed. We investigated the extent to which individual body size affects the exploitation of resources by examining Giving Up Density (GUD), Giving Up Time (GUT), resource absorption rate and exploitation efficiency as components of individual exploitation behaviour. To compare positive, constant and negative individual size scaling of population energy requirements, experimental trials with an equal numbers and equal biomass of differently sized foragers were carried out, and an experimental trial with equal metabolic requirements was simulated. We observed clear size dependency in the patch departure behaviour of the experimental organisms. Even under conditions of equivalent overall population energy requirements, larger foragers decided to leave the resource patch earlier and at a higher density of resources than smaller ones. Smaller foragers were able to prolong their presence and make more use of the resources, resulting in an inverse body-size scaling of resource exploitation efficiency.","",Temperate Northern Atlantic,0,10.1371/journal.pone.0204448,Field-based,"Univ Salento, Dept Biol & Environm Sci & Technol, Lab Ecol, Lecce",Italy,Italy

These events are often associated with increased water temperatures due to climate change as well as regional and local stress from nutrient enrichment through runoff and sedimentation from coastal development. In late 2014, a white syndrome disease outbreak was reported off the coast of southeast Florida and was subsequently documented spreading throughout the region. This study examined the regional impacts of the disease event on the southeast Florida stony coral population utilizing stony coral demographic data from the Southeast Florida Coral Reef Evaluation and Monitoring Project (SECREMP). SECREMP is a long-term monitoring project examining 22 sites distributed from Miami-Dade County north to Martin County, Florida. The results revealed significant region-wide declines in stony coral diversity, density, and live tissue area corresponding with increased disease prevalence, which reached its maximum for the study period in 2016. Regional declines in coral density approached 30% loss and live tissue was upward of 60% as a result of the disease outbreak. Additionally, multiple species were severely impacted, especially the reef building, complexity-contributing species Montastraea cavernosa, Meandrina meandrites, and Siderastrea siderea. The disease outbreak resulted in acute mortality and altered the ecosystem function to a point such that recovery is uncertain. This multiyear, regionwide disease outbreak has been indiscriminate relative to coral species impacted and was arguably the most devastating disturbance event documented on the Southeast Florida Reef Tract.","",Tropical Atlantic,0,10.3389/fmars.2018.00323,Field-based,"Nova Southeastern Univ, Halmos Coll Nat Sci & Oceanog, Dania",United States,United States

Bioerosion (i.e. biodegradation of substrate) and encrustation (i.e. calcified overgrowth on substrate) influence the carbonate budget and the ecological functions of coral reefs, by substrate formation/consolidation/erosion, food availability and nutrient cycling. This study investigates settlement succession and carbonate budget change by bioeroding and encrusting calcifying organisms on experimentally deployed coral substrates (skeletal fragments of Stylophora pistillate branches). The substrates were deployed in a marginal coral reef located in the Gulf of Papagayo (Costa Rica, Eastern Tropical Pacific) for four months during the northern winter upwelling period (December 2013 to March 2014), and consecutively sampled after each month. Due to the upwelling environmental conditions within the Eastern Tropical Pacific, this region serves as a natural laboratory to study ecological processes such as bioerosion, which may reflect climate change scenarios. Time-series analyses showed a rapid settlement of bioeroders, particularly of lithophagine bivalves of the genus Lithophaga/Leiosolenus (Dillwyn, 1817), within the first two months of exposure. The observed enhanced calcium carbonate loss of coral substrate (>30%) may influence seawater carbon chemistry. This is evident by measurements of an elevated seawater pH (>8.2) and aragonite saturation state (Omega(a)(rag) >3) at Matapalo Reef during the upwelling period, when compared to a previous upwelling event observed at a nearby site in distance to a coral reef (Marina Papagayo). Due to the resulting local carbonate buffer effect of the seawater, an influx of atmospheric CO2 into reef waters was observed. Substrates showed no secondary cements in thin-section analyses, despite constant seawater carbonate oversaturation (Omega(arag) >2.8) during the field experiment. Micro Computerized Tomography (mu CT) scans and microcast-embeddings of the substrates revealed that the carbonate loss was primarily due to internal macrobioerosion and an increase in microbioerosion. This study emphasizes the interconnected effects of upwelling and carbonate bioerosion on the reef carbonate budget and the ecological turnovers of carbonate producers in tropical coral reefs under environmental change.","",Tropical Eastern Pacific,0,10.1371/journal.pone.0202887,Field-based,"ZMT, Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Res, Bremen",Germany,Costa Rica

A total of 67 fish species belonging to 21 families were identified. Similar species richness estimates were observed between depths, though fish assemblage composition differed significantly, with observable changes in feeding guild contributions of herbivore and omnivore (20 m) to a deeper assemblage composed of piscivores and planktivores (45 m). Coral assemblages consisted of 31 species at 20 m and 11 species at 45 m, accounting for 17.0% (+/- 1.76 SE) and 2.6% (+/- 0.89 SE) benthic cover for the altiphotic and mesophotic surveys, respectively. The altiphotic and mesophotic coral reef communities support different scleractinian coral assemblages with minimal species overlap. Altiphotic surveys of sponges yielded a higher species richness than mesophotic, with 60 and 54 species respectively, and an overall total of 71 species identified from both depths, with 45 species overlapping (63.0%). The percent cover of sponges surveyed at altiphotic reefs accounted for 9.0% (+/- 1.04 SE), while the percent cover of sponges surveyed at mesophotic reefs was 14.0% (+/- 1.96 SE). Our data show fish, coral, and sponge assemblages are differentiated between 20 and 45 m along the Guanica shelf edge offshore of the Guanica Biosphere Reserve. This study represents the first observations for species distributions of adjacent altiphotic and mesophotic coral reef habitats along the Guanica shelf edge, as well as provides an annotated species list of the local sponge fauna.

This study investigated the influence of suspended sediment on reef fish assemblages and habitat composition over a cross-shelf turbidity gradient in the nearshore Pilbara region of Western Australia. The responses of all feeding guilds were analysed to identify feeding guilds vulnerable to elevations in suspended sediment and sedimentation. This study is the first of its kind to utilise both remotely sensed and in situ turbidity data to characterise the general turbidity regime and magnitude of stochastic events. By using the coordinates from a principle coordinates analysis, we were able to capture both the general turbidity conditions and stochastic turbidity spikes at each site, whilst the use of in situ turbidity measurements allowed us to effectively 'groundtruth' the remotely sensed TSS data. Underwater visual census was used to sample the fish assemblage and quantify habitat across the turbidity gradient. Generalised additive mixed models were used to explore the relationships between environmental variables, habitat variables, and fish assemblage metrics. Species richness significantly declined with increasing levels of turbidity. This study identified two key functional groups of fish that are vulnerable to elevated suspended sediment loads. Planktivorous omnivores and herbivorous scrapers decreased in abundance at high turbidity sites. Total biomass of herbivorous scrapers was lower at turbid sites, whilst the biomass of planktivorous omnivores was not related to any of the predictor variables. Changes in the abundance, biomass, and behaviour of these functional groups can have severe consequences for the resilience and recovery of coral reefs. Anthropogenic activities that elevate suspended sediment in regions where coral reef communities exist should consider these implications when designing management plans.","",Central Indo-Pacific,1,10.1007/s00338-018-1690-1,Field-based,"Univ Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, 35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley, WA 6009",Australia,Australia

Autotrophy and heterotrophy supply corals with specific omega 3 fatty acids, which can be used as trophic markers and record the contribution of each feeding strategy. This study investigated whether the reef-building coral Mussismilia hispida, endemic to Brazil, is able to shift between predominantly autotrophic and predominantly heterotrophic by monitoring the concentration of fatty acids in the host tissue. We then examined whether shifts are related to changes in temperature and wind stress. For that purpose, M. hispida colonies were monitored for a year with monthly tissue sampling. Symbiont concentration was determined and lipid extraction performed. Four fatty acids were quantitatively analyzed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector: the autotrophy markers: stearidonic acid (SDA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and a heterotrophy marker: cis-gondoic acid (CGA). Three preliminary experiments confirmed the specificity of SDA, DPA and CGA, but not of DHA. Shifts of predominance occurred multiple times during the year and were associated with minimal temperatures and wind stress. Colonies underwent mild bleaching during summer months, which they seemed to compensate with heterotrophic feeding. Our major findings include the validation of three FATM and a trophic index for coral reef ecology studies and also describing the in situ occurrences of shifts between feeding modes, while highlighting the role of temperature and meteorological events.","","",0,10.1007/s00338-018-1692-z,Field-based,"Univ Sao Paulo, Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol Oceanog, Praca Oceanog 191 Cidade Univ, BR-05508120 Sao Paulo, SP",Brazil,Brazil

However, their species diversity and role in nitrogen fixation are poorly understood. We assessed the cyanobacterial diversity of BCMs at four coral reef sites in Curacao, Southern Caribbean. In addition, nitrogen fixation rates of six common mats were measured. Microscopic examinations showed 22 cyanobacterial species, all from the order Oscillatoriales. Species diversity was similar among sites despite differences in overall BCM abundance. Dominant mats were primarily composed of Hydrocoletan glutinosum, Oscillatoria bonnemaisonii or Lyngbya majuscula. However, some mats exhibited highly variable species composition despite consistent macroscopic appearance. 16S rRNA-based phylogeny revealed similar species as those identified by microscopy, with additional sequences of unicellular (Xenococcus and Chroococcidiopsis) and heterocystous (Rivularia and Calothrix) cyanobacteria. Vice versa, morphotypes of Tychonema, Schizothrix and Dichothrix were found by microscopy only. The detection of similar species at the same sites in a study conducted 40 years ago indicates that changes in environmental conditions over these years may have favored indigenous species to bloom, rather than facilitated the introduction and proliferation of invasive species. Nitrogen fixation rates of mats were 3-10 times higher in the light than in the dark. The highest areal nitrogen fixation rate (169.1 mg N m(-2) d(-1)) was recorded in the cyanobacterial patch dominated by O. bonnemaisonii. A scale-up of nitrogen fixation at a site with 26% BCM cover at 7 m depth yielded an aerial rate of 13 mg N m(-2) reef d(-1), which exceeds rates reported in open ocean blooms of Trichodesmiun in the Caribbean. Our results suggest that the Caribbean basin is not only a hotspot for planktonic nitrogen fixation, but also for benthic nitrogen fixation.

We therefore assessed the effects of sediment loads and overfishing on the nutritional quality and yield to grazing fishes of algal turfs, within the epilithic algal matrix, on a coral reef at Lizard Island, Australia. Low, ambient and high sediment loads were maintained on turf-covered coral tiles, with and without grazer exclusion cages, for 1 month. Subsequently, algal turfs were removed and analysed for organic carbon and nitrogen content. Under grazer exclusion, sediment additions decreased algal turf biomass by approximately 63%, while algal turf biomass was the highest on tiles with sediments removed. In the presence of grazing fishes, algal turfs in all treatments were cropped by grazers to similar low biomass levels. Nitrogen content of algal turfs followed a similar trend. Effectively, added sediments decreased the potential yield of algal turf biomass and nitrogen to grazing fishes by an average of 2000 and 3300%, respectively.

Pursuit of this goal typically involves testing for associations between community structure and environmental conditions, and in recent years, attention has focused on temperature and seawater pH. Such analyses are helpful in projecting coral reef community structure into the future, but their efficacy depends on the extent to which changes in community structure are correctly associated with causative processes, and whether future conditions are a subset of those experienced in the past. Here, we describe variation from 2014 to 2017 in one environmental factor, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), at 19-m depth on the reefs of St. John, US Virgin Islands, and evaluate the extent to which this factor could cause changes in benthic community structure. The transmission of downwelling surface PAR to 19-m depth (TPAR-19) varied from 2.0 to 40.0% among days, and from 4.8 to 15.8% among months within a year, and was lower and more variable in the autumn versus other seasons. Monthly TPAR-19 was inversely associated with monthly rainfall, suggesting that runoff affected seawater clarity. The monthly diffuse attenuation coefficient (Kd-PAR) varied 1.7-fold from 0.097 to 0.164 m(-1) and was within the range expected for coral reefs. Given the high temporal variation in underwater light intensity, and its importance to foundational reef taxa, understanding of the response of coral reefs to temperature and pH (and other factors) will remain incomplete without closer attention to this physical environmental condition.","",Tropical Atlantic,2,10.1007/s00338-018-1721-y,Field-based,"Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, 18111 Nordhoff St, Northridge",United States,United States

In coral reef ecosystems, recent evidences have suggested that sponge assemblages in regions with high diversity, like the Caribbean, are controlled by reef fishes (i.e., top-down control); however, this has been poorly studied in low diversity coral reefs. This study investigated the influence of fish predators on sponge assemblage structure in South Atlantic coral reefs, systems with high endemism and relatively low hermatypic coral diversity. We investigates (i) whether sponge cover is negatively correlated to spongivorous fish density, (ii) potential spongivory effects on competitive interactions between sponges and hermatypic corals, and (iii) foraging preferences of spongivorous fishes. Benthic cover and spongivorous fish density were assessed by photo sampling and visual census, respectively. We did not observe a negative correlation of the total density of spongivorous fish with total sponge cover. However, a significant negative correlation between density of fish species Pomacanthus arcuatus and cover of sponge species Scopalina ruetzleri was found. Spongivorous fish consumed preferentially the sponges Desmapsamma anchorata, Niphates erecta, Aplysina cauliformis, and S. ruetzleri, the first two species considered palatable and the second two with chemically defense mechanism. An increase to angelfish density was not related with the number of coral-sponge encounters. Thus, the effects of spongivorous fishes on sponges cover and competitive interactions with hermatypic corals is weaker in Southwestern Atlantic than previously reported in Caribbean coral reefs. We discuss how local human impacts (e.g., fishing and nutrients input) can influence the observed patterns.","",Tropical Atlantic,1,10.3389/fmars.2018.00256,Field-based,"Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Biol, Lab Ecol Bentonica, CIENAM,Programa Posgrad Ecol & Biomonitoramento, Salvador, BA",Brazil,Brazil

The restricted biogeographic range sizes of endemic species have been interpreted to indicate low dispersal ability, whereas broad distributions of widespread species are assumed to indicate high dispersal potential. To assess that intuitive link, we analyzed mitochondrial cytochrome b and control region sequence data for two widespread damselfish species (Abudefduf vaigiensis and Chromis vanderbilti) across the Hawaiian Archipelago and broader Indo-Pacific and compared with three Hawaiian endemic damselfishes (A. abdominalis, C. ovalis, and C. verater). The widespread species exhibited less population structure in the Hawaiian Archipelago than the endemics. Across the larger spatial scale of their Indo-Pacific ranges, both widespread damselfish species showed strong and significant population structure. Our comparison of widespread and endemic damselfish species is consistent with the expected trend for widespread species to exhibit more connectivity within the Hawaiian Archipelago, but this pattern may be restricted to certain reef fish families. In addition, widespread species in this study and previous studies, which had little to no population subdivision within archipelagoes, have shown strong genetic structure when analyzed across the broader Indo-Pacific. We conclude that geographic range size may be a better indicator of dispersal ability at smaller (within archipelago) rather than at larger spatial scales (across oceans). Management should note that reef fishes unique to Hawaii seem to have less gene flow across the archipelago than more broadly distributed Indo-Pacific species.","",Eastern Indo-Pacific,0,10.1007/s00227-018-3395-y,Field-based,"Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz",United States,United States

While closely related to scleractinian corals and often occupying similar ecological niche space, it is currently poorly defined to what extent soft corals produce DMSP. We, therefore, examined DMSP content within four key species of soft coral in February and July-August of 2017, including two temperate species from Sydney Harbour (Erythropodium hicksoni, Capnella gaboensis) and two tropical species from the Great Barrier Reef (Sinularia sp., Sarcophyton sp.). We compared DMSP content of these soft coral species to that of commonly occurring temperate (Plesiastrea versipora) and tropical (Acropora aspera) scleractinian coral species. DMSP content was normalised to coral protein content, with soft coral DMSP content highly variable across species and locations [56-539 nmol (mg protein)(-1)], and lower than for the tropical [1242-4710 nmol (mg protein)(-1)], but not temperate [465-1984 nmol (mg protein)(-1)] scleractinian species. Further comparison with previously published values demonstrated that soft coral DMSP content falls within the ""low-mid range"" of scleractinian corals. Notably, DMSP content was also higher in summer samples than winter samples for the scleractinian corals, but did not differ between seasons for soft corals. Such contrasting dynamics of DMSP production by soft corals compared to scleractinian corals indicates that the regulation of DMSP content differs between these two important benthic cnidarian groups, potentially as a consequence of dissimilar ecophysiological roles for this compound.","","Central Indo-Pacific,Temperate Australasia",1,10.1007/s00227-018-3367-2,Field-based,"Univ Technol Sydney, Climate Change Cluster, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007",Australia,Australia

Marine species have been a difficult challenge in that respect, due to the difficulty in assessing population sizes and the open nature of such populations. Small, isolated islands with endemic species offer an opportunity to groundtruth population size estimates with empirical data and investigate the genetic consequences of such small populations. Here we focus on two endemic species of reef fish, the Clipperton damselfish, Stegastes baldwini, and the Clipperton angelfish, Holacanthus limbaughi, on Clipperton Atoll, tropical eastern Pacific. Visual surveys, performed over almost two decades and four expeditions, and genetic surveys based on genomic RAD sequences, allowed us to estimate kinship and genetic diversity, as well as to compare population size estimates based on visual surveys with effective population sizes based on genetics. We found that genetic and visual estimates of population numbers were remarkably similar. S. baldwini and H. limbaughi had population sizes of approximately 800,000 and 60,000, respectively. Relatively small population sizes resulted in low genetic diversity and the presence of apparent kinship.

Coral bleaching causes declines in CaCO3 production, but this varies with bleaching severity and the species impacted. We conducted census-based CaCO3 budget surveys using the established ReefBudget approach at Cheeca Rocks, an inshore patch reef in the Florida Keys, annually from 2012 to 2016. This site experienced warm-water bleaching in 2011, 2014, and 2015. In 2017, we obtained cores of the dominant calcifying coral at this site, Orbicella faveolata, to understand how calcification rates were impacted by bleaching and how they affected the reef-wide CaCO3 budget. Bleaching depressed O. faveolata growth and the decline of this one species led to an overestimation of mean (+/- std. error) reef-wide CaCO3 production by + 0.68 (+/- 0.167) to + 1.11 (+/- 0.236) kg m(-2) year(-1) when using the static ReefBudget coral growth inputs. During non-bleaching years, the ReefBudget inputs slightly underestimated gross production by - 0.10 (+/- 0.022) to - 0.43 (+/- 0.100) kg m(-2) year(-1). Carbonate production declined after the first year of back-to-back bleaching in 2014, but then increased after 2015 to values greater than the initial surveys in 2012. Cheeca Rocks is an outlier in the Caribbean and Florida Keys in terms of coral cover, carbonate production, and abundance of O. faveolata, which is threatened under the Endangered Species Act.

Here, we qualitatively describe the use of sUAS to survey the spatial characteristics of coral cover and the distribution of coral bleaching across patch reefs in KAne'ohe Bay, Hawaii, and address limitations and anticipated technology advancements within the field of UAS. Overlapping sub-decimeter low-altitude aerial reef imagery collected during the 2015 coral bleaching event was used to construct high-resolution reef image mosaics of coral bleaching responses on four KAn'ohe Bay patch reefs, totaling similar to 60,000 m(2). Using sUAS imagery, we determined that paled, bleached and healthy corals on all four reefs were spatially clustered. Comparative analyses of data from sUAS imagery and in situ diver surveys found as much as 14% difference in coral cover values between survey methods, depending on the size of the reef and area surveyed. When comparing the abundance of unhealthy coral (paled and bleached) between sUAS and in situ diver surveys, we found differences in cover from 1 to 49%, depending on the depth of in situ surveys, the percent of reef area covered with sUAS surveys and patchiness of the bleaching response. This study demonstrates the effective use of sUAS surveys for assessing the spatial dynamics of coral bleaching at colony-scale resolutions across entire patch reefs and evaluates the complementarity of data from both sUAS and in situ diver surveys to more accurately characterize the spatial ecology of coral communities on reef flats and slopes.","",Tropical Eastern Pacific,1,10.1007/s00338-018-1662-5,Field-based,"Univ Hawaii Manoa, Appl Res Lab, Honolulu",United States,United States

Since adult coral colonies are sessile, the settlement preferences of larvae have a strong impact on the competition for space that corals will face post-metamorphosis and will therefore influence long-term survival. Laboratory-based studies show that in simplified systems coral larvae use cues to guide them to suitable settlement locations, an adaptation that enhances post-settlement survival. Settlement preferences have also been reported from the field, where coral larvae encounter a wide variety of different potential settlement surfaces as the availability of free substratum (bare space) changes over time. In this field-based study, the abundance of different encrusting organisms and bare space present on settlement tiles was compared to their abundance under newly settled pocilloporid and poritid recruits, to determine if recruits choose their settlement substratum randomly. Tiles deployed for 3, 9, 12 and 15 months were used to determine if settlement choice varied as a function of benthic community successional stage. We found that pocilloporid and poritid larvae changed their settlement preference depending on the age of the benthic community they encountered. They reacted neutrally to crustose coralline algae (CCA) on tiles deployed for 3 months when bare space was abundant, but showed a clear preference for settlement on CCA on tiles deployed for 9-15 months once bare space was limited. Simultaneously, poritid recruits showed a decreasing preference over time to settle on biofilm. This change in preference is not linked to the availability of CCA because its abundance did not change significantly between tiles deployed for 3 versus 9-15 months.

Since adult coral colonies are sessile, the settlement preferences of larvae have a strong impact on the competition for space that corals will face post-metamorphosis and will therefore influence long-term survival. Laboratory-based studies show that in simplified systems coral larvae use cues to guide them to suitable settlement locations, an adaptation that enhances post-settlement survival. Settlement preferences have also been reported from the field, where coral larvae encounter a wide variety of different potential settlement surfaces as the availability of free substratum (bare space) changes over time. In this field-based study, the abundance of different encrusting organisms and bare space present on settlement tiles was compared to their abundance under newly settled pocilloporid and poritid recruits, to determine if recruits choose their settlement substratum randomly. Tiles deployed for 3, 9, 12 and 15 months were used to determine if settlement choice varied as a function of benthic community successional stage. We found that pocilloporid and poritid larvae changed their settlement preference depending on the age of the benthic community they encountered. They reacted neutrally to crustose coralline algae (CCA) on tiles deployed for 3 months when bare space was abundant, but showed a clear preference for settlement on CCA on tiles deployed for 9-15 months once bare space was limited. Simultaneously, poritid recruits showed a decreasing preference over time to settle on biofilm.

To understand the mechanisms underlying the recovery process of coral communities, colony abundance and size distribution were followed on reefs around Pelorus Island, located in the inshore central region of the Great Barrier Reef, following a severe tropical cyclone in 2011 that caused dramatic loss of coral communities. Permanent quadrats (600 m(2)) were monitored biannually between 2012 and 2016, and individual coral colonies were counted, sized and categorized into morphological types. The abundance of coral recruits and coral cover were also examined using permanent quadrats and random line intercept transects, respectively. The number of colonies in the smallest size class (4-10 cm) increased substantially during the study period, driving the recovery of coral populations. The total number of coral colonies 5 yr post-cyclone reached between 73 and 122% of pre-cyclone levels though coral cover remained between 16 and 31% of pre-cyclone levels, due to the dominance of small coral colonies in the recovering communities. Temporal transitions of coral demography (i.e., colony-size distributions) illustrated that the number of recently established coral populations overtook communities of surviving colonies. Coral recruits (< 4 cm in size) also showed increasing patterns in abundance over the study period, underscoring the importance of larval supply in coral recovery. A shift in morphological composition of coral communities was also observed, with the relative abundance of encrusting corals reduced post-cyclone in contrast to their dominance prior to the disturbance. This study identifies the fine-scale processes involved in the initial recovery of coral reefs, providing insights into the dynamics of coral demography that are essential for determining coral reef resilience following major disturbance.","",Central Indo-Pacific,1,10.1007/s00338-018-1668-z,Field-based,"Australian Inst Marine Sci, PMB 3 Townsville MC, Townsville, Qld 4810",Australia,Australia

Because coral reefs often have high geomorphic complexity, circulation patterns and the duration of exposure, or ""local residence time"" of a water parcel, can vary substantially over small distances. Different meteorologic and oceanographic forcings can further alter residence time patterns over reefs. Here, spatially dense Lagrangian surface current drifters and Eulerian current meters were used to characterize circulation patterns and resulting residence times over different regions of the reefs in Faga'alu Bay, American Samoa, during three distinct forcing periods: calm, strong winds, and large waves. Residence times varied among different geomorphic zones of the reef and were reflected in the spatially varying health of the corals across the embayment. The relatively healthy, seaward fringing reef consistently had the shortest residence times, as it was continually flushed by wave breaking at the reef crest, whereas the degraded, sheltered, leeward fringing reef consistently had the longest residence times, suggesting this area is more exposed to land-based sources of pollution. Strong wind forcing resulted in the longest residence times by pinning the water in the bay, whereas large wave forcing flushed the bay and resulted in the shortest residence times. The effect of these different forcings on residence times was fairly consistent across all reef geomorphic zones, with the shift from wind to wave forcing shortening mean residence times by approximately 50%. Although ecologically significant to the coral organisms in the nearshore reef zones, these shortened residence times were still 2-3 times longer than those associated with the seaward fringing reef across all forcing conditions, demonstrating how the geomorphology of a reef environment sets a first-order control on reef health.","",Eastern Indo-Pacific,0,10.1007/s00338-018-1671-4,Field-based,"US Geol Survey, Pacific Coastal & Marine Sci Ctr, Santa Cruz",United States,American Samoa

We show larvae are able to identify the occupant saturation state and sex of the resident occupants based on chemical cues alone, with larvae preferring the chemical cues produced by a single male to a single female, the single fish to an empty sea anemone, and an empty sea anemone to a sea anemone containing an adult pair. These behavioral preferences were reflected in the settlement preferences of larvae when assessed in the natural environment. We hypothesize that the ability of resident fish to evict incoming larvae combined with the selective pressure on larvae to locate an ideal habitat has resulted in the larval ability to accurately identify habitat where settlement and future breeding opportunities are most likely achieved.","",Central Indo-Pacific,0,10.1007/s00338-018-1676-z,Field-based,"Univ Delaware, Sch Marine Sci & Policy, 700 Pilottown Rd, Lewes",United States,Papua New Guinea
90,Snapping shrimp sound production patterns on Caribbean coral reefs: relationships with celestial cycles and environmental variables,CORAL REEFS,2018,MARINE SOUNDSCAPES; TIME-SERIES; HABITATS; NOISE; SEA; BIODIVERSITY; SYNALPHEUS; SETTLEMENT; SIGNATURES; INDEXES,"The rich acoustic environment of coral reefs, including the sounds of a variety of fish and invertebrates, is a reflection of the structural complexity and biological diversity of these habitats. Emerging interest in applying passive acoustic monitoring and soundscape analysis to measure coral reef habitat characteristics and track ecological patterns is hindered by a poor understanding of the most common and abundant sound producers on reefs-the snapping shrimp. Here, we sought to address several basic biophysical drivers of reef sound by investigating acoustic activity patterns of snapping shrimp populations on two adjacent coral reefs using a detailed snap detection analysis routine to a high-resolution 2.5-month acoustic dataset from the US Virgin Islands. The reefs exhibited strong diel and lunar periodicity in snap rates and clear spatial differences in snapping levels. Snap rates peaked at dawn and dusk and were higher overall during daytime versus nighttime, a seldom-reported pattern in earlier descriptions of diel snapping shrimp acoustic activity. Small differences between the sites in snap rate rhythms were detected and illustrate how analyses of specific soundscape elements might reveal subtle between-reef variation. Snap rates were highly correlated with environmental variables, including water temperature and light, and were found to be sensitive to changes in oceanographic forcing. This study further establishes snapping shrimp as key players in the coral reef chorus and provides evidence that their acoustic output reflects a combination of environmental conditions, celestial influences, and spatial habitat variation. Effective application of passive acoustic monitoring in coral reef habitats using snap rates or snapping-influenced acoustic metrics will require a mechanistic understanding of the underlying spatial and temporal variation in snapping shrimp sound production across multiple scales.","",Tropical Atlantic,1,10.1007/s00338-018-1684-z,Field-based,"Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole",United States,United States Virgin Islands

We predicted that the currents in the Capricorn Bunker Group, including their wind driven components and the Capricorn Eddy (a nearby transient oceanic eddy), would affect patterns of recruitment. A biophysical model was used to investigate this prediction. L. carponotatus were collected from One Tree Island and the dates when they were in the plankton as larvae were determined from their otoliths. The winds present during the pelagic phases of the fish were examined; they were found to have survived either longshore (SSE) winds that induced little cross shelf movement in the larval plume or cross shelf (ENE) winds that induced little longshore movement. The unidirectional transportation of the larval plume in these conditions was favorable for recruitment as it kept the plume concentrated in the Capricorn Bunker Group. These winds were more prevalent in the periods of peak L. carponotatus production that preceded high recruitment. Dispersal under average winds (6.2 m s(-1) from the prevailing ESE) and strong winds (velocity 1.5 times average), with and without the Capricorn Eddy, was also modeled. Each of these combinations were less favorable for recruitment than the longshore and cross shelf winds larval L. carponotatus survived before reaching OTI. The larval plume was comparatively less concentrated in the Capricorn Bunker Group under average winds. Strong winds transported the larval plume far longshore, to the NW, away from the Capricorn Bunker Group, while the Capricorn Eddy transported larvae seaward into oceanic waters. Larval swimming could counteract these dispersive forces; however, significant dispersion had occurred before larvae developed strong swimming and orientation abilities.

Here we document how early successional benthic coral reef communities change in situ along gradients of carbon dioxide (CO2), and the consequences of these changes on rates of community photosynthesis, respiration, and light and dark calcification. Ninety standardised benthic communities were grown on PVC tiles deployed at two shallow-water volcanic CO2 seeps and two adjacent control sites in Papua New Guinea. Along the CO2 gradient, both the upward facing phototrophic and the downward facing cryptic communities changed in their composition. Under ambient CO2, both communities were dominated by calcifying algae, but with increasing CO2 they were gradually replaced by non-calcifying algae (predominantly green filamentous algae, cyanobacteria and macroalgae, which increased from similar to 30% to similar to 80% cover). Responses were weaker in the invertebrate communities, however ascidians and tube-forming polychaetes declined with increasing CO2. Differences in the carbonate chemistry explained a far greater amount of change in communities than differences between the two reefs and successional changes from five to 13 months, suggesting community successions are established early and are under strong chemical control. As pH declined from 8.0 to 7.8, rates of gross photosynthesis and dark respiration of the 13-month old reef communities (upper and cryptic surfaces combined) significantly increased by 10% and 20%, respectively, in response to altered community composition. As a consequence, net production remained constant. Light and dark calcification rates both gradually declined by 20%, and low or negative daily net calcification rates were observed at an aragonite saturation state of <2.3. The study demonstrates that ocean acidification as predicted for the end of this century will strongly alter reef communities, and will significantly change rates of community metabolism.","",Central Indo-Pacific,1,10.1371/journal.pone.0197130,Field-based,"Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld",Australia,Papua New Guinea

Coral reefs modify overlying water column chemistry through biogeochemical processes such as net community organic carbon production (NCR) and calcification (NCC). However, the relative importance and influence of these processes on seawater carbonate chemistry vary across multiple functional scales (defined here as space, time, and benthic community composition), and have not been fully constrained. Here, we use Bermuda as a case study to assess (1) spatiotemporal variability in physical and chemical parameters along a depth gradient at a rim reef location, (2) the spatial variability of total alkalinity (TA) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) over distinct benthic habitats to infer NCC:NCP ratios [< several km(2); rim reef vs. seagrass and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) sediments] on diel timescales, and (3) compare how TA-DIC relationships and NCC:NCP vary as we expand functional scales from local habitats to the entire reef platform (10's of km(2)) on seasonal to interannual timescales. Our results demonstrate that TA-DIC relationships were strongly driven by local benthic metabolism and community composition over diel cycles. However, as the spatial scale expanded to the reef platform, the TA-DIC relationship reflected processes that were integrated over larger spatiotemporal scales, with effects of NCC becoming increasingly more important over NCR. This study demonstrates the importance of considering drivers across multiple functional scales to constrain carbonate chemistry variability over coral reefs.","",Temperate Northern Atlantic,1,10.3389/fmars.2018.00175,Field-based,"Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, Moss Landing",United States,Bermuda

Reef recovery relies on recruitment of young fishes for the replenishment of functionally important taxa. Acoustic cues guide the orientation, habitat selection, and settlement of many fishes, but these processes may be impaired if degradation alters reef soundscapes. Here, we report spatiotemporally matched evidence of soundscapes altered by degradation from recordings taken before and after recent severe damage on Australia's Great Barrier Reef. Postdegradation soundscapes were an average of 15 dB re 1 mu Pa quieter and had significantly reduced acoustic complexity, richness, and rates of invertebrate snaps compared with their predegradation equivalents. We then used these matched recordings in complementary light-trap and patch-reef experiments to assess responses of wild fish larvae under natural conditions. We show that postdegradation soundscapes were 8% less attractive to presettlement larvae and resulted in 40% less settlement of juvenile fishes than predegradation soundscapes; postdegradation soundscapes were no more attractive than open-ocean sound. However, our experimental design does not allow an estimate of how much attraction and settlement to isolated postdegradation soundscapes might change compared with isolated predegradation soundscapes. Reductions in attraction and settlement were qualitatively similar across and within all trophic guilds and taxonomic groups analyzed. These patterns may lead to declines in fish populations, exacerbating degradation. Acoustic changes might therefore trigger a feedback loop that could impair reef resilience. To understand fully the recovery potential of coral reefs, we must learn to listen.","",Central Indo-Pacific,2,10.1073/pnas.1719291115,Field-based,"Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Biosci, Exeter EX4 4QD, Devon",United Kingdom,Australia

Here we show that the reproductive output of a coral population is not proportional to the cover of coral present. Instead, when compared to declining populations nearby, high cover coral populations produced up to four times more larvae per square centimeter of tissue, resulting in up to 200 times higher larval production per square meter of reef. Importantly, corals that produced more larvae did not produce smaller larvae, as predicted by resource allocation theory. Instead, higher fecundity corresponded to higher energetic lipid reserves in higher cover coral populations. In the wake of unprecedented global coral bleaching, our findings suggest that the largest reductions in coral reproduction may occur when corals are lost from previously healthy populations.","",Tropical Atlantic,3,10.1111/conl.12410,Field-based,"Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Ctr Marine Biodivers & Conservat, La Jolla",United States,Curacao

It is particularly unknown whether ontogenetic compartmentalization of trace metal accumulation is species-specific. We studied here for the first time the intracolonial distribution and concentrations of 18 trace metals in the octocorals Subergorgia suberosa, Echinogorgia complexa and E. reticulata that were retrieved from the northern coast of Taiwan. Levels of trace metals were considerably elevated in corals collected at these particular coral habitats as a result of diverse anthropogenic inputs. There was a significant difference in the concentration of metals among octocorals except for Sn. Both species of Echinogorgia contained significantly higher concentrations of Cu, Zn and Al than Subergorgia suberosa. We used for the first time exponential growth curves that describe an age-specific relationship of octocoral trace metal concentrations of Cu, Zn, Cd, Cr and Pb where the distance from the grip point was reflecting younger age as linear regressions. The larger colony (C7) had a lower accumulation rate constant than the smaller one (C6) for Cu, Zn, Cd, Cr and Pb, while other trace metals showed an opposite trend. The Cu concentration declined exponentially from the grip point, whereas the concentrations of Zn, Cd, Cr and Pb increased exponentially. In S. suberosa and E. reticulata, Zn occurred primarily in coenosarc tissues and Zn concentrations increased with distance from the grip point in both skeletal and coenosarc tissues. Metals which appeared at high concentrations (e.g. Ca, Zn and Fe) generally tended to accumulate in the outer coenosarc tissues, while metals with low concentrations (e.g. V) tended to accumulate in the soft tissues of the inner","",Temperate Northern Pacific,1,10.1371/journal.pone.0196222,Field-based,"Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Inst Marine Biol, Keelung",Taiwan,"Taiwan, Province Of China"

In 2015, a major bleaching event was declared as the ""3rd global coral bleaching event"" by the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, impacting a large number of reefs in every major ocean. The Red Sea was no exception, and we present herein in situ observations of the status of coral reefs in the central Saudi Arabian Red Sea from September 2015, following extended periods of high temperatures reaching upwards of 32.5 degrees C in our study area. We examined eleven reefs using line-intercept transects at three different depths, including all reefs that were surveyed during a previous bleaching event in 2010. Bleaching was most prevalent on inshore reefs (55.6% +/- 14.6% of live coral cover exhibited bleaching) and on shallower transects (41% +/- 10.2% of live corals surveyed at 5m depth) within reefs. Similar taxonomic groups (e.g., Agariciidae) were affected in 2015 and in 2010. Most interestingly, Acropora and Porites had similar bleaching rates (similar to 30% each) and similar relative coral cover (similar to 7% each) across all reefs in 2015. Coral genera with the highest levels of bleaching (>60%) were also among the rarest (<1% of coral cover) in 2015. While this bodes well for the relative retention of coral cover, it may ultimately lead to decreased species richness, often considered an important component of a healthy coral reef. The resultant long-term changes in these coral reef communities remain to be seen.","",Western Indo-Pacific,3,10.1371/journal.pone.0195814,Field-based,"King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Div Biol & Environm Sci & Engn, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal",Saudi Arabia,Saudi Arabia

While such heat-induced loss of algal symbionts (zooxanthellae) directly affects anemones and corals physiologically, this damage may also cascade on to other animal symbionts. Metabolic rate is an integrative physiological trait shown to relate to various aspects of organismal performance, behaviour and locomotor capacity, and also shows plasticity during exposure to acute and chronic stressors. As climate warming is expected to affect the physiology, behaviour and life history of animals, including ectotherms such as fish, we measured if residing in bleached versus unbleached sea anemones (Heteractis magnifica) affected the standard (i.e. baseline) metabolic rate and behaviour (activity) of juvenile orange-fin anemonefish (Amphiprion chrysopterus). Metabolic rate was estimated from rates of oxygen uptake Mo-2), and the standard metabolic rate (Mo-2mm) of anemonefish from bleached anemones was significantly higher by 8.2% compared with that of fish residing in unbleached anemones, possibly due to increased stress levels. Activity levels did not differ between fish from bleached and unbleached anemones. As Mo-2mm reflects the minimum cost of living, the increased metabolic demands may contribute to the negative impacts of bleaching on important anemonefish life history and fitness traits observed previously (e.g. reduced spawning frequency and lower fecundity).","",Eastern Indo-Pacific,0,10.1098/rspb.2018.0282,Field-based,"Univ Glasgow, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Graham Kerr Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark",United Kingdom,French Polynesia
115,The trophic ecology of Caribbean reef sharks (Carcharhinus perezi) relative to other large teleost predators on an isolated coral atoll,MARINE BIOLOGY,2018,STABLE-ISOTOPES; SEAGRASS ECOSYSTEM; MOVEMENT PATTERNS; HABITAT USE; BODY-SIZE; GALEOCERDO-CUVIER; APEX PREDATORS; FOOD WEBS; POSITION; CASCADES,"Bulk stable isotope analysis was used to assess the trophic level and foraging habitats of Caribbean reef sharks (Carcharhinus perezi) compared to three large sympatric predatory teleosts (the Nassau grouper Epinephelus striatus, black grouper Mycteroperca bonaci, and great barracuda Sphyraena barracuda) in an isolated Caribbean coral reef ecosystem. Models and empirical studies have suggested that the depletion of large-bodied sharks in coral reef ecosystems triggers a trophic cascade that could affect the benthic community, favoring algae over coral. The hypothesized cascade is based on the premise that sharks prey on large piscivorous teleost fish that in turn prey on key herbivorous fish. Analysis of nitrogen-stable isotopes (delta N-15) from white muscle tissue revealed neither adult or juvenile Caribbean reef sharks were significantly enriched in N-15 compared with sympatric predatory teleost species. Linear regression found no evidence of an ontogenetic increase in nitrogen with increasing body size for Caribbean reef sharks; however, there was a significant positive relationship between body size and carbon isotope (delta C-13) values. These results suggest that Caribbean reef sharks in isolated systems do not act as the apex predator in coral reef ecosystems primarily feeding on large-bodied sympatric teleosts. Instead, Caribbean reef sharks form part of an upper trophic-level predator guild alongside large-bodied teleosts, which makes the predicted trophic cascade as a result of the removal of reef sharks unlikely. Moreover, the body size-delta C-13 relationship suggests Caribbean reef sharks exhibit ontogenetic and individual variation in where they feed. The ecological role of this species is, therefore, complex and contextual, similar to carcharhinid species in the Indo-Pacific, emphasizing the need to further elucidate the interactions between reef sharks and the overall coral reef ecosystem so as to best inform effective conservation and management of the species.","",Tropical Atlantic,1,10.1007/s00227-018-3322-2,Field-based,"Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 3000 NE 151st St, North Miami",United States,Belize

Using flumes (5.0 x 0.3 x 0.3 m) located outdoors in Moorea, French Polynesia, we assembled local back reef communities with similar to 25% coral cover, and tested their response to pCO(2) levels of 344, 633, 870 and 1146 mu atm. Incubations began in late Austral spring (November 2015), and net community calcification (G(net)) and net community primary production (P-net) were measured prior to treatments, 24 h after treatment began, and biweekly or monthly thereafter until early Austral autumn (March 2016). G(net) was depressed under elevated pCO(2) over 4 months, although the magnitude of the response varied over time. The proportional decline in G(net) as a function of saturation state of aragonite (Omega(ar)) depended on the initial Omega(ar), but was 24% for a decline in Omega(ar) from 4.0 to 3.0, which is nearly twice as sensitive to variation in Omega(ar) than the previously published values for the net calcification of ex situ coral colonies. However, community G(net) was less sensitive to Omega(ar) than coral reefs that have been analyzed in situ. P-net was unaffected by pCO(2), but P-net and G(net) expressed on a hourly time base were positively associated, thus revealing the tight coupling between these metabolic processes. The high sensitivity of Gnet to pCO(2) for the back reef of Moorea, versus lower sensitivity of individual coral colony calcification to pCO(2), underscores the challenges of scaling-up experimental results on the effects of pCO(2) from coral reef organisms to coral reef communities.","",Eastern Indo-Pacific,1,10.1007/s00227-018-3324-0,Field-based,"Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, 18111 Nordhoff St, Northridge",United States,French Polynesia

Within the tropics, average temperature and thermal variation can differ among populations and consequently low-latitude populations may respond differently to increased temperatures than higher latitude tropical populations. In this study, we investigate the long-term effects of climate change relevant temperature increases on commonly measured condition metrics for a low-latitude population of damselfish (Acanthochromis polyacanthus). Adult fish were randomly assigned to one of the three seasonally cycling treatments: (1) current average ocean temperatures for the collection locations, (2) 1.5 degrees C, or (3) 3 degrees C higher than current average temperatures. Treatments were maintained for approximately 10 months. At the end of the experimental period, Fulton's K and hepatosomatic index were calculated for fish from each treatment group and critical thermal limit - (CTMax) was measured for a subset of fish at control temperatures. Fish mortality was recorded throughout the experimental period, as well as at the end of the experimental period after the introduction of a secondary exercise stressor. No significant effect of temperature was observed on fish condition (Fulton's K and hepatosomatic index); however, significant mortality was observed for fish maintained at 3 degrees C higher than current average temperatures. When a secondary exercise stressor was introduced, significant mortality was also observed at 1.5 degrees C higher than current average temperatures. Acute exposure to higher temperatures - (CTMax) suggested a much higher thermal tolerance for this population than long-term mortality, producing a thermal limit of 37.1 degrees C compared with a chronic thermal limit of 33 degrees C. Our results show that some basic measures of fish condition may not be capable of detecting lethal and sublethal effects of increased temperature.

We applied network theory to 4 years of acoustic telemetry data for grey reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) at Palmyra, an unfished atoll, to assess their potential role in nutrient dynamics throughout this remote ecosystem. We evaluated the dynamics of habitat connectivity and used network metrics to quantify shark-mediated nutrient distribution. Predator movements were consistent within year, but differed between years and by sex. Females used higher numbers of routes throughout the system, distributing nutrients over a larger proportion of the atoll. Extrapolations of tagged sharks to the population level suggest that prey consumption and subsequent egestion leads to the heterogeneous deposition of 94.5 kg d(-1) of nitrogen around the atoll, with approximately 86% of this probably derived from pelagic resources. These results suggest that sharks may contribute substantially to nutrient transfer from offshore waters to near-shore reefs, subsidies that are important for coral reef health.","",Eastern Indo-Pacific,3,10.1098/rspb.2017.2456,Field-based,"Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Silwood Pk Campus,Buckhurst Rd, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks",United Kingdom,United States

Highly restricted gene flow was discovered between populations on either side of the Indian Ocean using the control region as a mitochondrial marker (mtDNA). We verify this conclusion using 13 microsatellite markers and infer fine scale genetic structuring within the WIO. In total 387 samples from 21 sites were analysed using mtDNA and 13 microsatellite loci. Analysis included estimation of genetic diversity and population differentiation. A haplotype network was inferred using mtDNA. Nuclear markers were used in Bayesian clustering and a principal component analysis. Both markers confirmed strong genetic differentiation between WIO and Eastern Indian Ocean (EIO) populations, and a shallower population structure among Malagasy and East African mainland populations. Limited gene flow across the Mozambique Channel may be explained by its complex oceanography, which could cause local retention of larvae, limiting dispersal between Madagascar and the East African coast. Two other potential current-mediated barriers to larval dispersal suggested in the WIO, the split of the SEC at approximately 10 degrees S and the convergence of the Somali Current with the East African Coast Current at approximately 3 degrees S, were not found to form a barrier to gene flow in this species.",Indian Ocean,Western Indo-Pacific,1,10.1371/journal.pone.0193825,Field-based,"VUB, Marine Biol Ecol & Biodivers, Brussels",Belgium,

Conservation strategies that marshal local action and are tailored to the preferences of the target group are thus needed to sustain coral resources. We experimentally analyze the behavior of marine resource users in a coastal village in Indonesia to gain insight into whether people prefer to donate time or money to environmental or other charitable causes. Each person is subject to one of four treatments: monetary donation, monetary donation match, volunteer time donation, and volunteer time donation match. Contrasting with the existing literature, we find that participants give significantly more when donating money compared to time.

Conservation strategies that marshal local action and are tailored to the preferences of the target group are thus needed to sustain coral resources. We experimentally analyze the behavior of marine resource users in a coastal village in Indonesia to gain insight into whether people prefer to donate time or money to environmental or other charitable causes. Each person is subject to one of four treatments: monetary donation, monetary donation match, volunteer time donation, and volunteer time donation match. Contrasting with the existing literature, we find that participants give significantly more when donating money compared to time.

Survival was unaffected by exposure to either elevated stable or diel cycling pCO(2) conditions in both species. For A. polyacanthus there was a non-significant trend of decreased standard length and wet weight under stable, elevated pCO(2) conditions, whereas values in both the diel cycling treatments were closer to those observed under control conditions. A similar non-significant trend was observed for Am. percula, except that exposure to stable, elevated pCO(2) conditions resulted in slightly longer and heavier fish.

Iconic images of cleaner fish entering the mouths of predatory fish clients to remove ectoparasites epitomize their mutual benefit. Experimental manipulations of cleaner wrasse reveal declines in fish size and growth, and population abundance and diversity of client fishes in the absence of cleaner wrasse. Fishes grow more slowly and are less abundant and diverse on reefs without cleaner wrasse, both for larger species that are regularly cleaned and have high ectoparasite loads (""attractive species""), and for those smaller species that are rarely cleaned and are rarely infested with parasites (""unattractive species""). We therefore considered whether these previously observed declines in individual and population parameters on reefs without cleaners were related to increased ectoparasite infestation using an attractive species (Hemigymnus melapterus, Labridae) and an unattractive species (Pomacentrus amboinensis, Pomacentridae). Traps with these fish as a form of bait were deployed to sample blood-sucking gnathiid ectoparasites (Gnathiidae: Isopoda) on reefs from which cleaners (Labroides dimidiatus, Labridae) have been removed for 13 yr. Cleaner fish could not enter traps to access the clients/hosts, but gnathiids could enter the traps to infest hosts; thus, this method sampled the indirect effect of cleaners on gnathiid infestation of fish. Infestation was higher on reefs without cleaners than on those with them. The effect was only detected during the daytime when cleaners are active and only on the attractive species (H. melapterus). Thus, cleaner presence indirectly reduced fish exposure to parasites in a species that is highly susceptible to parasites, but not in one that is rarely infested with parasites. This suggests that cleaner presence indirectly reduces exposure of a common fish species to harmful parasites, which may explain some observed benefits in fishes at this location.","",Central Indo-Pacific,3,10.1007/s00338-017-1628-z,Field-based,"Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072",Australia,Australia

To investigate how sounds produced on a given reef relate to abiotic and biotic parameters and how that relationship may change over time, an observational study was conducted between September 2014 and January 2016 at seven Hawaiian reefs that varied in coral cover, rugosity, and fish assemblages. The reefs were equipped with temperature loggers and acoustic recording devices that recorded on a 10% duty cycle. Benthic and fish visual survey data were collected four times over the course of the study. On average, reefs ranged from 0 to 80% live coral cover, although changes between surveys were noted, in particular during the major El Nio-related bleaching event of October 2015. Acoustic analyses focused on two frequency bands (50-1200 and 1.8-20.5 kHz) that corresponded to the dominant spectral features of the major sound-producing taxa on these reefs, fish, and snapping shrimp, respectively. In the low-frequency band, the presence of humpback whales (December-May) was a major contributor to sound level, whereas in the high-frequency band sound level closely tracked water temperature. On shorter timescales, the magnitude of the diel trend in sound production was greater than that of the lunar trend, but both varied in strength among reefs, which may reflect differences in the species assemblages present. Results indicated that the magnitude of the diel trend was related to fish densities at low frequencies and coral cover at high frequencies; however, the strength of these relationships varied by season. Thus, long-term acoustic recordings capture the substantial acoustic variability present in coral-reef ecosystems and provide insight into the presence and relative abundance of sound-producing organisms.","",Eastern Indo-Pacific,1,10.1007/s00338-017-1638-x,Field-based,"Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole",United States,United States

In coral reef ecosystems, the differential susceptibility of coral taxa to climate-driven bleaching is predicted to shift coral assemblages towards reefs with an increased relative abundance of taxa with high thermal tolerance. Many thermally tolerant coral species are characterised by low structural complexity, with reduced habitat niche space for the small-bodied coral reef fishes on which piscivorous mesopredators feed. This study used a patch reef array to investigate the potential impacts of climate-driven shifts in coral assemblages on the trophodynamics of reef mesopredators and their prey communities. The 'tolerant' reef treatment consisted only of coral taxa of low susceptibility to bleaching, while 'vulnerable' reefs included species of moderate to high thermal vulnerability. 'Vulnerable' reefs had higher structural complexity, and the fish assemblages that established on these reefs over 18 months had higher species diversity, abundance and biomass than those on 'tolerant' reefs. Fish assemblages on 'tolerant' reefs were also more strongly influenced by the introduction of a mesopredator (Cephalopholis boenak). Mesopredators on 'tolerant' reefs had lower lipid content in their muscle tissue by the end of the 6-week experiment. Such sublethal energetic costs can compromise growth, fecundity, and survivorship, resulting in unexpected population declines in long-lived mesopredators. This study provides valuable insight into the altered trophodynamics of future coral reef ecosystems, highlighting the potentially increased vulnerability of reef fish assemblages to predation as reef structure declines, and the cost of changing prey availability on mesopredator condition.","",Central Indo-Pacific,2,10.1007/s00338-017-1639-9,Field-based,"James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811",Australia,Australia

However, the vast majority of coral reproduction research has focused exclusively on shallow reefs. The incentive for the present study was: (1) the recent accelerated global degradation of coral reefs; (2) the growing interest in mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs; 30-120 m depth) and their potential to serve as a larval source for shallow reefs; and (3) the lack of information on MCE coral reproduction. Here, we compare the reproduction and ecology of the depth-generalist coral Paramontastraea peresi between shallow (5-10 m) and mesophotic (40-45 m) habitats in the Gulf of Eilat/Aqaba, Red Sea. Field surveys were conducted to assess the living cover, abundance, and size frequency distribution of P. peresi. Four to six colonies from each habitat were sampled monthly between April 2015 and January 2017, and the gametogenesis cycles, fecundity, and oocyte sizes were measured. The reproductive cycle in the MCEs was shorter than in the shallow reef. Despite having larger polyps, the mesophotic colonies contained significantly smaller and fewer oocytes per polyp. In spite of the relatively stable environmental conditions of the MCEs, which may contribute to coral survival, scarcity of sunlight is probably a major energetic impediment to investment in reproduction by P. peresi at mesophotic depths. Further intensive reproductive studies in mesophotic reefs are thus required to assess the ability of corals in this environment to reproduce and constitute a larval source for depleted shallow-water reefs.","",Western Indo-Pacific,1,10.1007/s00338-017-1648-8,Field-based,"Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Zool, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv",Israel,Israel

Hypoxia may be a challenge for coral-reef fish that hide in the reef to avoid predators at night. Triggerfishes (Balistidae) are found in a variety of reef habitats, but they also are known to find refuge in reef crevices and holes at night, which may expose them to hypoxic conditions. The critical oxygen tension (P (crit)) was determined as the point below which oxygen uptake could not be maintained to support standard metabolic rate (SMR) for five species of triggerfish. The triggerfishes exhibited similar levels of hypoxia tolerance as other coral-reef and coastal marine fishes that encounter low oxygen levels in their environment. Two species, Rhinecanthus rectangulus and R. aculeatus, had the lowest P (crit) (similar to 3.0 kPa O-2), comparable to the most hypoxia-tolerant obligate coral-dwelling gobies, while Odonus niger and Sufflamen bursa were moderately tolerant to hypoxia (P (crit) similar to 4.5 kPa), and Xanthichthys auromarginatus was intermediate (P (crit) similar to 3.7 kPa). These differences in P (crit) were not due to differences in oxygen demand, as all the species had a similar SMR once mass differences were taken into account. The results suggest that triggerfish species are adapted for different levels of hypoxia exposure during nocturnal sheltering within the reef.","",Eastern Indo-Pacific,1,10.1007/s00338-017-1649-7,Field-based,"Hawaii Pacific Univ, Dept Nat Sci, 45-045 Kamehameha Hwy, Kaneohe",United States,United States

As such, ecological surveys are beginning to focus on corals that live in high thermal stress environments to understand how future coral populations may adapt to climate change. We investigated the relationship between coral growth, thermal microhabitat, symbionts type, and thermal acclimatization of four species of the Acropora hyacinthus complex in back-reef lagoons in American Samoa. Coral growth was measured from August 2010 to April 2016 using horizontal planar area of coral colonies derived from photographs and in situ maximum width measurements. Despite marked intraspecific variation, we found that planar colony growth rates were significantly different among cryptic species. The highly heat tolerant A. hyacinthus variant ""HE"" increased in area an average of 2.9% month(-1) (0.03 cm average mean radial extension month(-1)). By contrast, the three less tolerant species averaged 6.1% (0.07 cm average mean radial extension month(-1)). Planar growth rates were 40% higher on average in corals harboring Clade C versus Clade D symbiont types, although marked inter-colony variation in growth rendered this difference nonsignificant. Planar growth rates for all four species dropped to near zero following a 2015 bleaching event, independent of the visually estimated percent area of bleaching. Within 1 yr, growth rates recovered to previous levels, confirming previous studies that found sublethal effects of thermal stress on coral growth. Long-term studies of individual coral colonies provide an important tool to measure impacts of environmental change and allow integration of coral physiology, genetics, symbionts, and microclimate on reef growth patterns.","",Central Indo-Pacific,1,10.1007/s00338-018-1656-3,Field-based,"Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles",United States,American Samoa

However, the link between perception of baseline states and support for conservation planning has not been tested empirically. Here, we investigate how perceptions of change in coral reef ecosystems affect stakeholders' willingness to pay (WTP) for the establishment of protected areas. Coral reefs are experiencing rapid, global change that is observable by the public, and therefore provide an ideal ecosystem to test links between beliefs about baseline states and willingness to support conservation. Our survey respondents perceived change to coral reef communities across six variables: coral abundance, fish abundance, fish diversity, fish size, sedimentation, and water pollution. Respondants who accurately perceived declines in reef health had significantly higher WTP for protected areas (US $256.80 vs. $102.50 per year), suggesting that shifted baselines may reduce engagement with conservation efforts. If WTP translates to engagement, this suggests that goals for restoration and recovery are likely to be more ambitious if the public is aware of long term change. Therefore, communicating the scope and depth of environmental problems is essential in engaging the public in conservation.","","",0,10.3389/fmars.2018.00048,Field-based,"Colby Coll, Environm Studies Program, Waterville",United States,Japan

Intensive, size-specific fishing mortality induces directional shifts in phe-notypic frequencies towards the predominance of smaller and earlier-maturing individuals, which are among the primary causes of declining fish biomass. Fish that reproduce at smaller size and younger age produce fewer, smaller, and less viable larvae, severely reducing the reproductive capacity of harvested populations. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are extensively utilized in coral reefs for fisheries management, and are thought to mitigate the impacts of size-selective fishing mortality and supplement fished stocks through larval export. However, empirical evidence of disparities in fitness-relevant phenotypes between MPAs and adjacent fished reefs is necessary to validate this assertion. Here, we compare key life-history traits in three coral-reef fishes (Acanthurus nigrofuscus, Cteno-chaetus striatus, and Parupeneus multifasciatus) between MPAs and fished reefs in the Philippines. Results of our analyses support previous hypotheses regarding the impacts of MPAs on phenotypic traits. Asymptotic length (L-inf) and growth rates (K) differed between conspecifics in MPAs and fished reefs, with protected populations exhibiting phenotypes that are known to confer higher fecundity. Additionally, populations demonstrated increases in length at 50% maturity (L-50) inside MPAs compared to adjacent areas, although age at 50% maturity (A(50)) did not appear to be impacted by MPA establishment. Shifts toward advantageous phenotypes were most common in the oldest and largest MPAs, but occurred in all of the MPAs examined. These results suggest that MPAs may provide protection against the impacts of size-selective harvest on life-history traits in coral-reef fishes.","",Central Indo-Pacific,0,10.1371/journal.pone.0193426,Field-based,"Florida Inst Technol, Dept Biol Sci, Melbourne",United States,Philippines

In this study, we analyzed microsatellite genotypes, mitochondrial lineages, and morphometric data from 373 S. fuscescens individuals sampled from the northern Philippines and Hong Kong (South China Sea, Philippine Sea and Sulu Sea basins), to examine putative species boundaries in samples comprising three co-occurring mitochondrial lineages previously reported to characterize S. fuscescens (Clade A and Clade B) or S. canaliculatus (Clade C). We report the existence of two cryptic species within S. fuscescens in the northeast region of the South China Sea and northern Philippine Sea, supported by genetic and morphological differences. Individual-based assignment methods recovered concordant groupings of individuals into two nuclear genotype clusters (Cluster 1, Cluster 2) with (1) limited gene flow, if any, between them (F-ST = 0.241; P < 0.001); (2) low frequency of later-generation hybrids; (3) significant association with mitochondrial Clade A and Clade B, respectively; and (4) subtle yet significant body shape differences as inferred from geometric morphometric analysis. The divergence between mitochondrial Clade C and the two other clades was not matched by genetic differences at microsatellite marker loci. The occurrence of discordant mitonuclear combinations (20.5% of the total number of individuals) is thought to result from mitochondrial introgression, consistent with a scenario of demographic, and presumably spatial, post-Pleistocene expansion of populations from northern regions into a secondary contact zone in the South China Sea. Mitonuclear discordance due to introgression obscures phylogenetic relationships for recently-diverged lineages, and cautions against the use of mitochondrial markers alone for species identification within the mottled rabbitfish species complex in the South China Sea region.",Southeast Asia,Central Indo-Pacific,0,10.1371/journal.pone.0193220,Field-based,"Univ Philippines, Inst Marine Sci, Quezon City",Philippines,

For this purpose, we developed a novel method for simultaneous monitoring of Acropora corals and their symbiont, Symbiodinium, from environmental DNA (eDNA) in seawater using next generation sequencing technology (NGS). We performed a tank experiment with running seawater using 19 Acropora species. Complete mitochondrial genomes of all the Acropora species were assembled to create a database and major types of their Symbiodinium symbionts were identified. Then eDNA was isolated by filtering inlet and outlet seawater from the tanks. Acropora and Symbiodinium DNA were amplified by PCR and sequenced. We detected all of the tested Acropora types from eDNA samples. Proportions and numbers of DNA sequences were both positively correlated with masses of corals in the tanks. In this trial, we detected DNA sequences from as little as 0.04 kg of Acropora colony, suggesting that existence of at least one adult Acropora colony (similar to 30 cm diameter = 1 kg) per m(2) at depths < 10 m could be detected using eDNA in the field. In addition, we detected major types of Symbiodinium within host corals from seawater, suggesting that it should be possible to detect major coral symbiont types if Acropora corals exist nearby, and possible free-living state Symbiodinium cells from eDNA in seawater. eDNA abundance of Symbiodinium types did not correlate well with frequencies of major Symbiodinium types in the corals, suggesting that quantification of Symbiodinium is difficult at this stage. Although this is the initial attempt to detect coral and Symbiodinium simultaneously from eDNA in seawater, this method may allow us to perform high-frequency, high-density coral reef monitoring of both corals and their symbionts in the near future.","","",1,10.3389/fmars.2018.00028,Field-based,"Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Chiba",Japan,Japan

In this study, we used eight islands of the archipelago, varying in distance from 1 to 55 km relative to the mainland, and 3 years of surveys, to describe benthic and fish assemblages and to examine the spatial and temporal influence of benthic composition on the structure of the fish assemblages. Cluster analysis indicated that distinct groups of fish were associated with distance, while few species were present across the entire range of sites. Relating fish communities to benthic composition using a multivariate generalized linear model confirmed that fish groups relate to structural complexity (rugosity) or differing benthic groups; either algae, reef builders (coral and crustose coralline algae) or invertebrates and rubble. From these relationships we can identify sets of fish species that may be lost given continued degradation of the Spermonde reefs. Lastly, the incorporation of water quality, benthic and fish indices indicates that local coral reefs responded positively after an acute disturbance in 2013 with increases in reef builders and fish diversity over relatively short (1 year) time frames. This study contributes an important, missing component (fish community structure) to the growing literature on the Spermonde Archipelago, a system that features environmental pressures common in the greater Southeast Asian region.","",Central Indo-Pacific,4,10.3389/fmars.2018.00036,Field-based,"Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources DTU Aqua, Ctr Ocean Life, Lyngby",Denmark,Indonesia

To determine the main environmental drivers of coral reef status in the Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia, we monitored environmental variables and coral reef benthic community structure along an on-to-offshore gradient annually from 2012 to 2014. Findings revealed that concentrations of phosphate, chlorophyll a-like fluorescence, suspended particulate matter, and light attenuation significantly decreased from on-to-offshore, while concentrations of dissolved O-2 and values of water pH significantly increased on-to-offshore. Nitrogen stable isotope signatures of sediment and an exemplary common brown alga were significantly enriched nearshore, identifying wastewater input from the city of Makassar as primary N source. In contrast to the high temporal variability in water quality, coral reef benthic community cover did not show strong temporal, but rather, spatial patterns. Turf algae was the dominant group next to live coral, and was negatively correlated to live coral, crustose coralline algae (CCA), rubble and hard substrate. Variation in benthic cover along the gradient was explained by water quality variables linked to trophic status and physico-chemical variables. As an integrated measure of reef status and structural complexity, the benthic index, based on the ratio of relative cover of live coral and CCA to other coral reef organisms, and reef rugosity were determined. The benthic index was consistently low nearshore and increased offshore, with high variability in the midshelf sites across years. Reef rugosity was also lowest nearshore and increased further offshore. Both indices dropped in 2013, increasing again in 2014, indicating a period of acute disturbance and recovery within the study and suggesting that the mid-shelf reefs are more resilient to disturbance than nearshore reefs. We thus recommend using these two indices with a selected number of environmental variables as an integral part of future reef monitoring.","",Central Indo-Pacific,5,10.3389/fmars.2018.00033,Field-based,"Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Res, Bremen",Germany,Indonesia

Abundance estimation through UVC is particularly problematic in species occurring at low densities and/or highly aggregated because of their high variability at both spatial and temporal scales. The statistical power of experiments involving UVC techniques may be increased by augmenting the number of replicates or the area surveyed. In this work we present and test the efficiency of an UVC method based on diver towed GPS, the Tracked Roaming Transect (TRT), designed to maximize transect length (and thus the surveyed area) with respect to diving time invested in monitoring, as compared to Conventional Strip Transects (CST). Additionally, we analyze the effect of increasing transect width and length on the precision of density estimates by comparing TRT vs. CST methods using different fixed widths of 6 and 20 m (FW3 and FW10, respectively) and the Distance Sampling (DS) method, in which perpendicular distance of each fish or group of fishes to the transect line is estimated by divers up to 20 m from the transect line. The TRT was 74% more time and cost efficient than the CST (all transect widths considered together) and, for a given time, the use of TRT and/or increasing the transect width increased the precision of density estimates. In addition, since with the DS method distances of fishes to the transect line have to be estimated, and not measured directly as in terrestrial environments, errors in estimations of perpendicular distances can seriously affect DS density estimations. To assess the occurrence of distance estimation errors and their dependence on the observer's experience, a field experiment using wooden fish models was performed. We tested the precision and accuracy of density estimators based on fixed widths and the DS method. The accuracy of the estimates was measured comparing the actual total abundance with those estimated by divers using FW3, FW10, and DS estimators. Density estimates differed by 13% (range 0.1-31%) from the actual values (average = 13.09%; median = 14.16%). Based on our results we encourage the use of the Tracked Roaming Transect with Distance Sampling (TRT+DS) method for improving density estimates of species occurring at low densities and/or highly aggregated, as well as for exploratory rapid-assessment surveys in which divers could gather spatial ecological and ecosystem information on large areas during UVC.",Mediterranean,Temperate Northern Atlantic,2,10.1371/journal.pone.0190990,Field-based,"Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CCT CENPAT CONICE, Ctr Estudio Sistemas Marinos CESIMAR, Blvd Brown, Puerto Madryn, Chubut",Argentina,Spain
1678,Ecosystem restructuring along the Great Barrier Reef following mass coral bleaching,NATURE,2018,"","Global warming is markedly changing diverse coral reef ecosystems through an increasing frequency and magnitude of mass bleaching events(1-3). How local impacts scale up across affected regions depends on numerous factors, including patchiness in coral mortality, metabolic effects of extreme temperatures on populations of reef-dwelling species(4) and interactions between taxa. Here we use data from before and after the 2016 mass bleaching event to evaluate ecological changes in corals, algae, fishes and mobile invertebrates at 186 sites along the full latitudinal span of the Great Barrier Reef and western Coral Sea. One year after the bleaching event, reductions in live coral cover of up to 51% were observed on surveyed reefs that experienced extreme temperatures; however, regional patterns of coral mortality were patchy. Consistent declines in coral-feeding fishes were evident at the most heavily affected reefs, whereas few other short-term responses of reef fishes and invertebrates could be attributed directly to changes in coral cover. Nevertheless, substantial region-wide ecological changes occurred that were mostly independent of coral loss, and instead appeared to be linked directly to sea temperatures. Community-wide trophic restructuring was evident, with weakening of strong pre-existing latitudinal gradients in the diversity of fishes, invertebrates and their functional groups. In particular, fishes that scrape algae from reef surfaces, which are considered to be important for recovery after bleaching(2), declined on northern reefs, whereas other herbivorous groups increased on southern reefs. The full impact of the 2016 bleaching event may not be realized until dead corals erode during the next decade(5,6) . However, our short-term observations suggest that the recovery processes, and the ultimate scale of impact, are affected by functional changes in communities, which in turn depend on the thermal affinities of local reef-associated fauna. Such changes will vary geographically, and may be particularly acute at locations where many fishes and invertebrates are close to their thermal distribution limits(7).","",Central Indo-Pacific,9,10.1038/s41586-018-0359-9,Field-based,"Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas",Australia,Australia
1679,Mesophotic coral ecosystems are threatened and ecologically distinct from shallow water reefs,SCIENCE,2018,"","The rapid degradation of coral reefs is one of themost serious biodiversity problems facing our generation. Mesophotic coral reefs (at depths of 30 to 150 meters) have been widely hypothesized to provide refuge from natural and anthropogenic impacts, a promise for the survival of shallow reefs. The potential role of mesophotic reefs as universal refuges is often highlighted in reef conservation research. This hypothesis rests on two assumptions: (i) that there is considerable overlap in species composition and connectivity between shallow and deep populations and (ii) that deep reefs are less susceptible to anthropogenic and natural impacts than their shallower counterparts. Here we present evidence contradicting these assumptions and argue that mesophotic reefs are distinct, impacted, and in as much need of protection as shallow coral reefs.",Global,"",14,10.1126/science.aaq1614,Field-based,"Calif Acad Sci, San Francisco",United States,
1680,Seabirds enhance coral reef productivity and functioning in the absence of invasive rats,NATURE,2018,"","Biotic connectivity between ecosystems can provide major transport of organic matter and nutrients, influencing ecosystem structure and productivity(1), yet the implications are poorly understood owing to human disruptions of natural flows(2). When abundant, seabirds feeding in the open ocean transport large quantities of nutrients onto islands, enhancing the productivity of island fauna and flora(3,4). Whether leaching of these nutrients back into the sea influences the productivity, structure and functioning of adjacent coral reef ecosystems is not known. Here we address this question using a rare natural experiment in the Chagos Archipelago, in which some islands are rat-infested and others are rat-free. We found that seabird densities and nitrogen deposition rates are 760 and 251 times higher, respectively, on islands where humans have not introduced rats. Consequently, rat-free islands had substantially higher nitrogen stable isotope (delta N-15) values in soils and shrubs, reflecting pelagic nutrient sources. These higher values of delta N-15 were also apparent in macroalgae, filter-feeding sponges, turf algae and fish on adjacent coral reefs. Herbivorous damselfish on reefs adjacent to the rat-free islands grew faster, and fish communities had higher biomass across trophic feeding groups, with 48% greater overall biomass. Rates of two critical ecosystem functions, grazing and bioerosion, were 3.2 and 3.8 times higher, respectively, adjacent to rat-free islands. Collectively, these results reveal how rat introductions disrupt nutrient flows among pelagic, island and coral reef ecosystems. Thus, rat eradication on oceanic islands should be a high conservation priority as it is likely to benefit terrestrial ecosystems and enhance coral reef productivity and functioning by restoring seabird-derived nutrient subsidies from large areas of ocean.","",Western Indo-Pacific,9,10.1038/s41586-018-0202-3,Field-based,"James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld",Australia,Chagos

1680,Seabirds enhance coral reef productivity and functioning in the absence of invasive rats,NATURE,2018,"","Biotic connectivity between ecosystems can provide major transport of organic matter and nutrients, influencing ecosystem structure and productivity(1), yet the implications are poorly understood owing to human disruptions of natural flows(2). When abundant, seabirds feeding in the open ocean transport large quantities of nutrients onto islands, enhancing the productivity of island fauna and flora(3,4). Whether leaching of these nutrients back into the sea influences the productivity, structure and functioning of adjacent coral reef ecosystems is not known. Here we address this question using a rare natural experiment in the Chagos Archipelago, in which some islands are rat-infested and others are rat-free. We found that seabird densities and nitrogen deposition rates are 760 and 251 times higher, respectively, on islands where humans have not introduced rats. Consequently, rat-free islands had substantially higher nitrogen stable isotope (delta N-15) values in soils and shrubs, reflecting pelagic nutrient sources.

1684,Global warming transforms coral reef assemblages,NATURE,2018,"","Global warming is rapidly emerging as a universal threat to ecological integrity and function, highlighting the urgent need for a better understanding of the impact of heat exposure on the resilience of ecosystems and the people who depend on them(1). Here we show that in the aftermath of the record-breaking marine heatwave on the Great Barrier Reef in 2016(2), corals began to die immediately on reefs where the accumulated heat exposure exceeded a critical threshold of degree heating weeks, which was 3-4 degrees C-weeks. After eight months, an exposure of 6 degrees C-weeks or more drove an unprecedented, regional-scale shift in the composition of coral assemblages, reflecting markedly divergent responses to heat stress by different taxa. Fast-growing staghorn and tabular corals suffered a catastrophic die-off, transforming the three-dimensionality and ecological functioning of 29% of the 3,863 reefs comprising the world's largest coral reef system. Our study bridges the gap between the theory and practice of assessing the risk of ecosystem collapse, under the emerging framework for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Ecosystems(3), by rigorously defining both the initial and collapsed states, identifying the major driver of change, and establishing quantitative collapse thresholds. The increasing prevalence of post-bleaching mass mortality of corals represents a radical shift in the disturbance regimes of tropical reefs, both adding to and far exceeding the influence of recurrent cyclones and other local pulse events, presenting a fundamental challenge to the long-term future of these iconic ecosystems.","",Central Indo-Pacific,56,10.1038/s41586-018-0041-2,Field-based,"James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld",Australia,Australia
1685,Carbon dioxide addition to coral reef waters suppresses net community calcification,NATURE,2018,"","Coral reefs feed millions of people worldwide, provide coastal protection and generate billions of dollars annually in tourism revenue(1). The underlying architecture of a reef is a biogenic carbonate structure that accretes over many years of active biomineralizat ion by calcifying organisms, including corals and algae(2). Ocean acidification poses a chronic threat to coral reefs by reducing the saturation state of the aragonite mineral of which coral skeletons are primarily composed, and lowering the concentration of carbonate ions required to maintain the carbonate reef. Reduced calcification, coupled with increased bioerosion and dissolution(3), may drive reefs into a state of net loss this century(4). Our ability to predict changes in ecosystem function and associated services ultimately hinges on our understanding of community- and ecosystem-scale responses. Past research has primarily focused on the responses of individual species rather than evaluating more complex, community-level responses. Here we use an in situ carbon dioxide enrichment experiment to quantify the net calcification response of a coral reef flat to acidification. We present an estimate of community-scale calcification sensitivity to ocean acidification that is, to our knowledge, the first to be based on a controlled experiment in the natural environment. This estimate provides evidence that near-future reductions in the aragonite saturation state will compromise the ecosystem function of coral reefs.","",Central Indo-Pacific,14,10.1038/nature25968,Field-based,"Calif Acad Sci, San Francisco",United States,Australia

1686,Coral reefs will transition to net dissolving before end of century,SCIENCE,2018,"","Ocean acidification refers to the lowering of the ocean's pH due to the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 from the atmosphere. Coral reef calcification is expected to decrease as the oceans become more acidic. Dissolving calciumcarbonate (CaCO3) sands could greatly exacerbate reef loss associated with reduced calcification but is presently poorly constrained. Here we show that CaCO3 dissolution in reef sediments across five globally distributed sites is negatively correlated with the aragonite saturation state (War) of overlying seawater and that CaCO3 sediment dissolution is 10-fold more sensitive to ocean acidification than coral calcification. Consequently, reef sediments globally will transition from net precipitation to net dissolution when seawater War reaches 2.92 +/- 0.16 (expected circa 2050 CE). Notably, some reefs are already experiencing net sediment dissolution.",Global,"",20,10.1126/science.aao1118,Field-based,"Southern Cross Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Ctr Coastal Biogeochem, Lismore, NSW 2480",Australia,

We assessed the influence of plastic waste on disease risk in 124,000 reef-building corals from 159 reefs in the Asia-Pacific region. The likelihood of disease increases from 4% to 89% when corals are in contact with plastic. Structurally complex corals are eight times more likely to be affected by plastic, suggesting that microhabitats for reef-associated organisms and valuable fisheries will be disproportionately affected. Plastic levels on coral reefs correspond to estimates of terrestrial mismanaged plastic waste entering the ocean. We estimate that 11.1 billion plastic items are entangled on coral reefs across the Asia-Pacific and project this number to increase 40% by 2025.
