How local impacts scale up across affected regions depends on numerous factors, including patchiness in coral mortality, metabolic effects of extreme temperatures on populations of reef-dwelling species(4) and interactions between taxa. Here we use data from before and after the 2016 mass bleaching event to evaluate ecological changes in corals, algae, fishes and mobile invertebrates at 186 sites along the full latitudinal span of the Great Barrier Reef and western Coral Sea. One year after the bleaching event, reductions in live coral cover of up to 51% were observed on surveyed reefs that experienced extreme temperatures; however, regional patterns of coral mortality were patchy. Consistent declines in coral-feeding fishes were evident at the most heavily affected reefs, whereas few other short-term responses of reef fishes and invertebrates could be attributed directly to changes in coral cover. Nevertheless, substantial region-wide ecological changes occurred that were mostly independent of coral loss, and instead appeared to be linked directly to sea temperatures. Community-wide trophic restructuring was evident, with weakening of strong pre-existing latitudinal gradients in the diversity of fishes, invertebrates and their functional groups. In particular, fishes that scrape algae from reef surfaces, which are considered to be important for recovery after bleaching(2), declined on northern reefs, whereas other herbivorous groups increased on southern reefs. The full impact of the 2016 bleaching event may not be realized until dead corals erode during the next decade(5,6) . However, our short-term observations suggest that the recovery processes, and the ultimate scale of impact, are affected by functional changes in communities, which in turn depend on the thermal affinities of local reef-associated fauna. Such changes will vary geographically, and may be particularly acute at locations where many fishes and invertebrates are close to their thermal distribution limits(7).","[Stuart-Smith, Rick D.; Edgar, Graham J.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Brown, Christopher J.] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Ceccarelli, Daniela M.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia",9,10.1038/s41586-018-0359-9,2018

Mesophotic coral reefs (at depths of 30 to 150 meters) have been widely hypothesized to provide refuge from natural and anthropogenic impacts, a promise for the survival of shallow reefs. The potential role of mesophotic reefs as universal refuges is often highlighted in reef conservation research. This hypothesis rests on two assumptions: (i) that there is considerable overlap in species composition and connectivity between shallow and deep populations and (ii) that deep reefs are less susceptible to anthropogenic and natural impacts than their shallower counterparts. Here we present evidence contradicting these assumptions and argue that mesophotic reefs are distinct, impacted, and in as much need of protection as shallow coral reefs.","[Rocha, Luiz A.; Pinheiro, Hudson T.; Shepherd, Bart; Bongaerts, Pim] Calif Acad Sci, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA; [Papastamatiou, Yannis P.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Luiz, Osmar J.] Charles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Darwin, NT 0810, Australia; [Pyle, Richard L.] Bernice P Bishop Museum, Honolulu, HI 96817 USA; [Bongaerts, Pim] Univ Queensland, Global Change Inst, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",14,10.1126/science.aaq1614,2018

When abundant, seabirds feeding in the open ocean transport large quantities of nutrients onto islands, enhancing the productivity of island fauna and flora(3,4). Whether leaching of these nutrients back into the sea influences the productivity, structure and functioning of adjacent coral reef ecosystems is not known. Here we address this question using a rare natural experiment in the Chagos Archipelago, in which some islands are rat-infested and others are rat-free. We found that seabird densities and nitrogen deposition rates are 760 and 251 times higher, respectively, on islands where humans have not introduced rats. Consequently, rat-free islands had substantially higher nitrogen stable isotope (delta N-15) values in soils and shrubs, reflecting pelagic nutrient sources. These higher values of delta N-15 were also apparent in macroalgae, filter-feeding sponges, turf algae and fish on adjacent coral reefs. Herbivorous damselfish on reefs adjacent to the rat-free islands grew faster, and fish communities had higher biomass across trophic feeding groups, with 48% greater overall biomass. Rates of two critical ecosystem functions, grazing and bioerosion, were 3.2 and 3.8 times higher, respectively, adjacent to rat-free islands. Collectively, these results reveal how rat introductions disrupt nutrient flows among pelagic, island and coral reef ecosystems. Thus, rat eradication on oceanic islands should be a high conservation priority as it is likely to benefit terrestrial ecosystems and enhance coral reef productivity and functioning by restoring seabird-derived nutrient subsidies from large areas of ocean.","[Graham, Nicholas A.

Here we calculate the vertical growth potential of more than 200 tropical western Atlantic and Indian Ocean reefs, and compare these against recent and projected rates of SLR under different Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. Although many reefs retain accretion rates close to recent SLR trends, few will have the capacity to track SLR projections under RCP4.5 scenarios without sustained ecological recovery, and under RCP8.5 scenarios most reefs are predicted to experience mean water depth increases of more than 0.5 m by 2100. Coral cover strongly predicts reef capacity to track SLR, but threshold cover levels that will be necessary to prevent submergence are well above those observed on most reefs.

Here we show that in the aftermath of the record-breaking marine heatwave on the Great Barrier Reef in 2016(2), corals began to die immediately on reefs where the accumulated heat exposure exceeded a critical threshold of degree heating weeks, which was 3-4 degrees C-weeks. After eight months, an exposure of 6 degrees C-weeks or more drove an unprecedented, regional-scale shift in the composition of coral assemblages, reflecting markedly divergent responses to heat stress by different taxa. Fast-growing staghorn and tabular corals suffered a catastrophic die-off, transforming the three-dimensionality and ecological functioning of 29% of the 3,863 reefs comprising the world's largest coral reef system. Our study bridges the gap between the theory and practice of assessing the risk of ecosystem collapse, under the emerging framework for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Ecosystems(3), by rigorously defining both the initial and collapsed states, identifying the major driver of change, and establishing quantitative collapse thresholds. The increasing prevalence of post-bleaching mass mortality of corals represents a radical shift in the disturbance regimes of tropical reefs, both adding to and far exceeding the influence of recurrent cyclones and other local pulse events, presenting a fundamental challenge to the long-term future of these iconic ecosystems.","[Hughes, Terry P.; Kerry, James T.; Baird, Andrew H.; Connolly, Sean R.; Dietzel, Andreas; Hoey, Andrew S.; Hoogenboom, Mia O.; McWilliam, Michael J.; Pratchett, Morgan S.; Torda, Gergely] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Connolly, Sean R.; Hoogenboom, Mia O.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Eakin, C.

The underlying architecture of a reef is a biogenic carbonate structure that accretes over many years of active biomineralizat ion by calcifying organisms, including corals and algae(2). Ocean acidification poses a chronic threat to coral reefs by reducing the saturation state of the aragonite mineral of which coral skeletons are primarily composed, and lowering the concentration of carbonate ions required to maintain the carbonate reef. Reduced calcification, coupled with increased bioerosion and dissolution(3), may drive reefs into a state of net loss this century(4). Our ability to predict changes in ecosystem function and associated services ultimately hinges on our understanding of community- and ecosystem-scale responses. Past research has primarily focused on the responses of individual species rather than evaluating more complex, community-level responses. Here we use an in situ carbon dioxide enrichment experiment to quantify the net calcification response of a coral reef flat to acidification. We present an estimate of community-scale calcification sensitivity to ocean acidification that is, to our knowledge, the first to be based on a controlled experiment in the natural environment. This estimate provides evidence that near-future reductions in the aragonite saturation state will compromise the ecosystem function of coral reefs.","[Albright, Rebecca; Takeshita, Yuichiro; Koweek, David A.; Nebuchina, Yana; Caldeira, Ken] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Albright, Rebecca] Calif Acad Sci, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA; [Takeshita, Yuichiro] Monterey Bay Aquariun Res Inst, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA; [Ninokawa, Aaron; Young, Jordan] UC Davis Bodega Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA; [Wolfe, Kennedy] Univ Sydney, Sch Med Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Rivlin, Tanya] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Interuniv Inst Marine Sci, H Steinitz Marine Biol Lab, IL-8810300 Coral Beach, Eilat, Israel; [Rivlin, Tanya] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fredy & Nadine Herrman Inst Earth Sci, Edmond J Safra Campus, IL-9190401 Jerusalem, Israel",14,10.1038/nature25968,2018

Here we show that CaCO3 dissolution in reef sediments across five globally distributed sites is negatively correlated with the aragonite saturation state (War) of overlying seawater and that CaCO3 sediment dissolution is 10-fold more sensitive to ocean acidification than coral calcification. Consequently, reef sediments globally will transition from net precipitation to net dissolution when seawater War reaches 2.92 +/- 0.16 (expected circa 2050 CE).

Here we sequenced genomes of COTS from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia and Okinawa, Japan to identify gene products that underlie species-specific communication and could potentially be used in biocontrol strategies. We focused on water-borne chemical plumes released from aggregating COTS, which make the normally sedentary starfish become highly active. Peptide sequences detected in these plumes by mass spectrometry are encoded in the COTS genome and expressed in external tissues. The exoproteome released by aggregating COTS consists largely of signalling factors and hydrolytic enzymes, and includes an expanded and rapidly evolving set of starfish-specific ependymin-related proteins. These secreted proteins may be detected by members of a large family of olfactory-receptor-like G-protein-coupled receptors that are expressed externally, sometimes in a sex-specific manner.

A presently unexplored approach that draws on theory and practice in human health and rural development(4,5) is to systematically identify and learn from the 'outliers'-places where ecosystems are substantially better ('bright spots') or worse ('dark spots') than expected, given the environmental conditions and socioeconomic drivers they are exposed to. Here we compile data from more than 2,500 reefs worldwide and develop a Bayesian hierarchical model to generate expectations of how standing stocks of reef fish biomass are related to 18 socioeconomic drivers and environmental conditions. We identify 15 bright spots and 35 dark spots among our global survey of coral reefs, defined as sites that have biomass levels more than two standard deviations from expectations. Importantly, bright spots are not simply comprised of remote areas with low fishing pressure; they include localities where human populations and use of ecosystem resources is high, potentially providing insights into how communities have successfully confronted strong drivers of change. Conversely, dark spots are not necessarily the sites with the lowest absolute biomass and even include some remote, uninhabited locations often considered near pristine(6). We surveyed local experts about social, institutional, and environmental conditions at these sites to reveal that bright spots are characterized by strong sociocultural institutions such as customary taboos and marine tenure, high levels of local engagement in management, high dependence on marine resources, and beneficial environmental conditions such as deep-water refuges. Alternatively, dark spots are characterized by intensive capture and storage technology and a recent history of environmental shocks. Our results suggest that investments in strengthening fisheries governance, particularly aspects such as participation and property rights, could facilitate innovative conservation actions that help communities defy expectations of global reef degradation.","[Cinner, Joshua E.; Huchery, Cindy; MacNeil, M.

Less clear is how temperate viruses, which coexist and replicate with their host, influence microbial communities. Here we show that virus-like particles are relatively less abundant at high host densities. This suggests suppressed lysis where established models predict lytic dynamics are favoured. Meta-analysis of published viral and microbial densities showed that this trend was widespread in diverse ecosystems ranging from soil to freshwater to human lungs. Experimental manipulations showed viral densities more consistent with temperate than lytic life cycles at increasing microbial abundance. An analysis of 24 coral reef viromes showed a relative increase in the abundance of hallmark genes encoded by temperate viruses with increased microbial abundance. Based on these four lines of evidence, we propose the Piggyback-the-Winner model wherein temperate dynamics become increasingly important in ecosystems with high microbial densities; thus 'more microbes, fewer viruses'.","[Knowles, B.; Silveira, C.

This process, referred to as ocean acidification, represents a major threat to marine ecosystems, in particular marine calcifiers such as oysters, crabs, and corals. Laboratory and field studies(2,3) have shown that calcification rates of many organisms decrease with declining pH, [CO32-], and Omega. Coral reefs are widely regarded as one of the most vulnerable marine ecosystems to ocean acidification, in part because the very architecture of the ecosystem is reliant on carbonate-secreting organisms(4). Acidification-induced reductions in calcification are projected to shift coral reefs from a state of net accretion to one of net dissolution this century(5). While retrospective studies show large-scale declines in coral, and community, calcification over recent decades(6-12), determining the contribution of ocean acidification to these changes is difficult, if not impossible, owing to the confounding effects of other environmental factors such as temperature. Here we quantify the net calcification response of a coral reef flat to alkalinity enrichment, and show that, when ocean chemistry is restored closer to pre-industrial conditions, net community calcification increases. In providing results from the first seawater chemistry manipulation experiment of a natural coral reef community, we provide evidence that net community calcification is depressed compared with values expected for pre-industrial conditions, indicating that ocean acidification may already be impairing coral reef growth.","[Albright, Rebecca; Caldeira, Lilian; Kwiatkowski, Lester; Maclaren, Jana K.; Nebuchina, Yana; Pongratz, Julia; Ricke, Katharine L.; Schneider, Kenneth; Sesbouee, Marine; Zhu, Kai; Caldeira, Ken] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hosfelt, Jessica; Ninokawa, Aaron] Univ Calif Davis, Bodega Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA; [Maclaren, Jana K.] Stanford Univ, Stanford Nano Shared Facil, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Mason, Benjamin M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Pongratz, Julia] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Bundesstr 53, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Ricke, Katharine L.] Cornell Univ, Sibley Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Rivlin, Tanya] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Interuniv Inst Marine Sci, H Steinitz Marine Biol Lab, Elat, Israel; [Rivlin, Tanya] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fredy & Nadine Herrman Inst Earth Sci, Edmond J Safra Campus, Jerusalem, Israel; [Schneider, Kenneth] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Robert H Smith Fac Agr Food & Environm, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Shamberger, Kathryn] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Shamberger, Kathryn] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Silverman, Jacob] Inst Oceanog & Limnol Res, Haifa, Israel; [Wolfe, Kennedy] Univ Sydney, Sch Med Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Zhu, Kai] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Zhu, Kai] Rice Univ, Dept BioSci, Houston, TX 77005 USA",79,10.1038/nature17155,2016

Fishing is the primary source of diminished reef function globally(3-5), leading to widespread calls for additional marine reserves to recover fish biomass and restore key ecosystem functions(6). Yet there are no established baselines for determining when these conservation objectives have been met or whether alternative management strategies provide similar ecosystem benefits. Here we establish empirical conservation benchmarks and fish biomass recovery timelines against which coral reefs can be assessed and managed by studying the recovery potential of more than 800 coral reefs along an exploitation gradient. We show that resident reef fish biomass in the absence of fishing (B-0) averages similar to 1,000 kg ha(-1), and that the vast majority (83%) of fished reefs are missing more than half their expected biomass, with severe consequences for key ecosystem functions such as predation. Given protection from fishing, reef fish biomass has the potential to recover within 35 years on average and less than 60 years when heavily depleted. Notably, alternative fisheries restrictions are largely (64%) successful at maintaining biomass above 50% of B-0, sustaining key functions such as herbivory. Our results demonstrate that crucial ecosystem functions can be maintained through a range of fisheries restrictions, allowing coral reef managers to develop recovery plans that meet conservation and livelihood objectives in areas where marine reserves are not socially or politically feasible solutions.","[MacNeil, M.

Local acclimatization and fixed effects, such as adaptation, contributed about equally to heat tolerance and are reflected in patterns of gene expression. In less than 2 years, acclimatization achieves the same heat tolerance that we would expect from strong natural selection over many generations for these long-lived organisms.

Therefore, reefs isolated by distance or current patterns are thought to be highly vulnerable to catastrophic disturbance. We found that on an isolated reef system in north Western Australia, coral cover increased from 9% to 44% within 12 years of a coral bleaching event, despite a 94% reduction in larval supply for 6 years after the bleaching. The initial increase in coral cover was the result of high rates of growth and survival of remnant colonies, followed by a rapid increase in juvenile recruitment as colonies matured. We show that isolated reefs can recover from major disturbance, and that the benefits of their isolation from chronic anthropogenic pressures can outweigh the costs of limited connectivity.","[Gilmour, James P.; Smith, Luke D.; Heyward, Andrew J.] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Inst, AIMS, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Baird, Andrew H.; Pratchett, Morgan S.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",180,10.1126/science.1232310,2013

Experimental evidence suggests that coral calcification decreases as aragonite saturation drops but increases as temperatures rise toward thresholds optimal for coral growth. In situ studies have documented alarming recent declines in calcification rates on several tropical coral reef ecosystems. We show there is no widespread pattern of consistent decline in calcification rates of massive Porites during the 20th century on reefs spanning an 11 degrees latitudinal range in the southeast Indian Ocean off Western Australia. Increasing calcification rates on the high-latitude reefs contrast with the downward trajectory reported for corals on Australia's Great Barrier Reef and provide additional evidence that recent changes in coral calcification are responses to temperature rather than ocean acidification.,"[Cooper, Timothy F.; O'Leary, Rebecca A.] Univ Western Australia, Australian Inst Marine Sci, Oceans Inst, Crawley 6009, Australia; [Lough, Janice M.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia",85,10.1126/science.1214570,2012

Distinct characteristics in the carbon isotope signatures of the major carbon reservoirs (ocean, biosphere, sediments and atmosphere) constrain variations in the CO2 fluxes between those reservoirs. Here we present a highly resolved atmospheric delta C-13 record for the past 11,000 years from measurements on atmospheric CO2 trapped in an Antarctic ice core. From mass-balance inverse model calculations(3,4) performed with a simplified carbon cycle model, we show that the decrease in atmospheric CO2 of about 5 parts per million by volume (p.p.m.v.). The increase in delta C-13 of about 0.25 parts per thousand during the early Holocene is most probably the result of a combination of carbon uptake of about 290 gigatonnes of carbon by the land biosphere and carbon release from the ocean in response to carbonate compensation of the terrestrial uptake during the termination of the last ice age. The 20 p.p.m.v. increase of atmospheric CO2 and the small decrease in delta C-13 of about 0.05 parts per thousand during the later Holocene can mostly be explained by contributions from carbonate compensation of earlier land-biosphere uptake and coral reef formation, with only a minor contribution from a small decrease of the land-biosphere carbon inventory.","[Elsig, Joachim; Schmitt, Jochen; Leuenberger, Daiana; Schneider, Robert; Eyer, Marc; Leuenberger, Markus; Joos, Fortunat; Fischer, Hubertus; Stocker, Thomas F.] Univ Bern, Inst Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Elsig, Joachim; Schmitt, Jochen; Leuenberger, Daiana; Schneider, Robert; Eyer, Marc; Leuenberger, Markus; Joos, Fortunat; Fischer, Hubertus; Stocker, Thomas F.] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Schmitt, Jochen; Fischer, Hubertus] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res AWI, D-27568 Bremerhaven, Germany",118,10.1038/nature08393,2009

Under conditions expected in the 21st century, global warming and ocean acidification will compromise carbonate accretion, with corals becoming increasingly rare on reef systems. The result will be less diverse reef communities and carbonate reef structures that fail to be maintained. Climate change also exacerbates local stresses from declining water quality and overexploitation of key species, driving reefs increasingly toward the tipping point for functional collapse. This review presents future scenarios for coral reefs that predict increasingly serious consequences for reef- associated fisheries, tourism, coastal protection, and people.

Unlike many problems in physics, the nature of the interactions in ecological communities is not completely known. Although most contemporary theories in ecology start with the basic premise that species interact, here we show that a theory in which all interspecific interactions are turned off leads to analytical results that are in agreement with RSA data from tropical forests and coral reefs. The assumption of non-interacting species leads to a sampling theory for the RSA that yields a simple approximation at large scales to the exact theory.

Reefs in the Caribbean are among the most heavily affected(2,3), having experienced mass disease-induced mortality of the herbivorous urchin Diadema antillarum(4) in 1983 and two framework-building species of coral(5). Declining reef health is characterized by increases in macroalgae. A critical question is whether the observed macroalgal bloom on Caribbean reefs is easily reversible. To answer this question, we must resolve whether algal-dominated reefs are an alternative stable state of the ecosystem or simply the readily reversible result of a phase change along a gradient of some environmental or ecological parameter(6). Here, using a fully parameterized simulation model in combination with a simple analytical model, we show that Caribbean reefs became susceptible to alternative stable states once the urchin mortality event of 1983 confined the majority of grazing to parrotfishes. We reveal dramatic hysteresis in a natural system(7,8) and define critical thresholds of grazing and coral cover beyond which resilience is lost. Most grazing thresholds lie near the upper level observed for parrotfishes in nature, suggesting that reefs are highly sensitive to parrotfish exploitation. Ecosystem thresholds can be combined with stochastic models of disturbance to identify targets for the restoration of ecosystem processes. We illustrate this principle by estimating the relationship between current reef state (coral cover and grazing) and the probability that the reef will withstand moderate hurricane intensity for two decades without becoming entrained in a shift towards a stable macroalgal-dominated state. Such targets may help reef managers face the challenge of addressing global disturbance at local scales.","Univ Exeter, Sch Biosci, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England; Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA",430,10.1038/nature06252,2007

Reef corals provide the habitat structure that sustains the high biodiversity of tropical reefs(7), and thus provide the foundation for the ecosystem goods and services that are critical to many tropical societies(6,8). Here we integrate predictions from oceanographic models(9) with engineering theory, to predict the dislodgement of benthic reef corals during hydrodynamic disturbances. This generalizes earlier work(10,11), by incorporating colonies of any shape and by explicitly examining the effects of hydrodynamic gradients on coral assemblage structure. Afield test shows that this model accurately predicts changes in the mechanical vulnerability of coral colonies, and thus their size and shape, with distance from the reef crest. This work provides a general framework for understanding and predicting the effects of hydrodynamic disturbances on coral reef communities; such disturbances have a major role in determining species zonation(12,13) and coexistence(14) on coral reefs, and are critical determinants of how coral assemblages will respond to changes in the frequency and intensity of tropical storms associated with a changing climate(3-5,15).","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ N Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA",158,10.1038/nature05328,2006

The neutral theory, which assumes that individuals are demographically identical regardless of species, seeks to explain ubiquitous features of community structure and biodiversity patterns(3-5). Here we present a test of neutral-theory predictions with the use of an extensive species-level data set of Indo-Pacific coral communities. We show that coral assemblages differ markedly from neutral-model predictions for patterns of community similarity and the relative abundance of species. Within local communities, neutral models do not fit relative abundance distributions as well as the classical log-normal distribution. Relative abundances of species across local communities also differ markedly from neutral-theory predictions: coral communities exhibit community similarity values that are far more variable, and lower on average, than the neutral theory can produce. Empirical community similarities deviate from the neutral model in a direction opposite to that predicted in previous critiques of the neutral theory(6-9). Instead, our results support spatio-temporal environmental stochasticity as a major driver of diversity patterns on coral reefs(10,11).","James Cook Univ N Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",157,10.1038/nature04534,2006

We also show the importance of the early onset of active larval movement mediating the dispersal potential. In addition to self -recruitment, larval import from outside the local area is required to sustain most populations, although these population subsidies are very limited in particular systems. The results reveal distinct regions of population isolation based on larval dispersal that also correspond to genetic and morphological clines observed across a range of marine organisms.","Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA",825,10.1126/science.1122039,2006

The grazing capacity of these fishes could be impaired if marine reserves achieve their long-term goal of restoring large consumers, several of which prey on parrotfishes. Here we compare the negative impacts of enhanced predation with the positive impacts of reduced fishing mortality on parrotfishes inside reserves. Because large-bodied parrotfishes escape the risk of predation from a large piscivore (the Nassau grouper), the predation effect reduced grazing by only 4 to 8%. This impact was overwhelmed by the increase in density of large parrotfishes, resulting in a net doubling of grazing. Increased grazing caused a fourfold reduction in the cover of macroalgae, which, because they are the principal competitors of corals, highlights the potential importance of reserves for coral reef resilience.","Univ Exeter, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Sch Biosci, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England; Perry Inst Marine Sci, Jupiter, FL 33477 USA; Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA; Amer Museum Nat Hist, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat, New York, NY 10024 USA; Univ W Indies, Dept Life Sci, Kingston 7, Jamaica; Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Affairs & Policy, Miami, FL 33149 USA; Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA; Univ Arizona, Bur Appl Res Anthropol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; Cranfield Univ, Inst Water & Environm, Silsoe MK45 4DT, Beds, England",504,10.1126/science.1121129,2006

It remains unclear, however, whether this diversity - stability relationship can be scaled up to regional scales, or to longer timescales(5). Without empirical validation at larger scales, the implications of the diversity - stability relationship for both ecology and long-term conservation strategies cannot readily be resolved. Here I show that in biogenic reefs, ecological stability is related to taxonomic diversity on million-year timescales. The higher the mean reef diversity in a particular time interval, the smaller the change in skeletal density, style of reef building and biotic reef types in the subsequent time interval. Because the relationships apply to a wide spectrum of disturbance regimes and reef types, these results support the hypothesis that species richness itself promotes ecological stability(3). Carbonate production by reefs, while closely correlated with reef diversity without temporal lag, is not stabilized by reef diversity over these long timescales. This suggests that ecological stability and productivity may be decoupled in natural ecosystems.","Humboldt Univ, Museum Nat Hist, D-10115 Berlin, Germany",53,10.1038/nature03152,2005

Managing for improved resilience, incorporating the role of human activity in shaping ecosystems, provides a basis for coping with uncertainty, future changes and ecological surprises. Here we review the ecological roles of critical functional groups (for both corals and reef fishes) that are fundamental to understanding resilience and avoiding phase shifts from coral dominance to less desirable, degraded ecosystems. We identify striking biogeographic differences in the species richness and composition of functional groups, which highlight the vulnerability of Caribbean reef ecosystems.

Thus, a better understanding of how broad- as well as local-scale processes affect species diversity and richness is increasingly becoming a central focus in modern community ecology(6-9). Here, in a study of unprecedented geographical scope, we show significant regional and local variation in the species richness of coral assemblages across an oceanic biodiversity gradient. The gradient that we sampled extends 10,000 km eastwards from the world's richest coral biodiversity hotspot in the central Indo-Pacific(10). Local richness and the size of regional species pools decline significantly across 15 islands spanning the gradient. In addition, richness declines across three adjacent habitats ( reef slopes, crests and flats). In each habitat, a highly consistent linear relationship between local and regional species richness indicates strong regional enrichment. Thus, even on the most diverse coral reefs in the world, local coral assemblages are profoundly affected by regional-scale processes. Understanding these historical and biogeographical influences is essential for the effective management and preservation of these endangered communities.","Univ Delaware, Dept Biol Sci, Newark, DE 19716 USA; James Cook Univ N Queensland, Dept Marine Biol, Ctr Coral Reef Biodivers, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",97,10.1038/nature02685,2004

Here we show that this assumption is incorrect on the basis of analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear genes. Pervasive morphological convergence at the family level has obscured the evolutionary distinctiveness of Atlantic corals. Some Atlantic genera conventionally assigned to different families are more closely related to each other than they are to their respective Pacific 'congeners'. Nine of the 27 genera of reef-building Atlantic corals belong to this previously unrecognized lineage, which probably diverged over 34 million years ago.

Juvenile coral reef fish often inhabit mangroves(2-5), but the importance of these nurseries to reef fish population dynamics has not been quantified. Indeed, mangroves might be expected to have negligible influence on reef fish communities: juvenile fish can inhabit alternative habitats and fish populations may be regulated by other limiting factors such as larval supply or fishing(6). Here we show that mangroves are unexpectedly important, serving as an intermediate nursery habitat that may increase the survivorship of young fish. Mangroves in the Caribbean strongly influence the community structure of fish on neighbouring coral reefs. In addition, the biomass of several commercially important species is more than doubled when adult habitat is connected to mangroves. The largest herbivorous fish in the Atlantic, Scarus guacamaia, has a functional dependency on mangroves and has suffered local extinction after mangrove removal. Current rates of mangrove deforestation are likely to have severe deleterious consequences for the ecosystem function, fisheries productivity and resilience of reefs.

Mean SSTs have been forecast to rise above the 1998 values in a few decades(2,3); however, forecast SSTs rarely flow seamlessly from historical data, or may show erroneous seasonal oscillations, precluding an accurate prediction of when lethal SSTs will recur. Differential acclimation by corals in different places complicates this further(3,7,8). Here I scale forecast SSTs at 33 Indian Ocean sites where most shallow corals died in 1998 (ref. 1) to identify geographical patterns in the timing of probable repeat occurrences. Reefs located 10-15degrees south will be affected every 5 years by 2010-2025. North and south from this, dates recede in a pattern not directly related to present SSTs; paradoxically, some of the warmest sites may be affected last. Temperatures lethal to corals vary in this region by 6degreesC, and acclimation of a modest 2degreesC by corals could prolong their survival by nearly 100 years.","Univ Warwick, Dept Biol Sci, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",232,10.1038/nature01987,2003

Sea surface temperature reconstructions show that although some past upwelling events have been stronger, there were no analogous episodes of coral mortality during the past 7000 years, indicating that the 1997 red tide was highly unusual. We show that iron fertilization by the 1997 Indonesian wild. res was sufficient to produce the extraordinary red tide, leading to reef death by asphyxiation. These findings highlight tropical wild. res as an escalating threat to coastal marine ecosystems.","Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; Indonesian Inst Sci, Res & Dev Ctr Geotechnol, Bandung 40135, Indonesia",122,10.1126/science.1083841,2003

We compiled records, extending back thousands of years, of the status and trends of seven major guilds of carnivores, herbivores, and architectural species from 14 regions. Large animals declined before small animals and architectural species, and Atlantic reefs declined before reefs in the Red Sea and Australia, but the trajectories of decline were markedly similar worldwide. All reefs were substantially degraded long before outbreaks of coral disease and bleaching. Regardless of these new threats, reefs will not survive without immediate protection from human exploitation over large spatial scales.","Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Paleobiol, Washington, DC 20013 USA; Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Resource & Environm Studies, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Ctr Marine Biodivers & Conservat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; James Cook Univ, Ctr Coral Reef Biodivers, Sch Marine Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; Univ Florida, Archie Carr Ctr Sea Turtle Res, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Ctr Trop Paleoecol & Archaeol, Balboa, Panama; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Calif Sea Grant, Cooperat Extens, Santa Barbara, CA 93105 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",1047,10.1126/science.1085706,2003

Highstands of sea level can be reconstructed from dated fossil coral reef terraces(6,7), and these data are complemented by a compilation of global sea-level estimates based on deep-sea oxygen isotope ratios at millennial-scale resolution(8) or higher(1). Records based on oxygen isotopes, however, contain uncertainties in the range of +/-30 m, or +/-1degreesC in deep sea temperature(9,10). Here we analyse oxygen isotope records from Red Sea sediment cores to reconstruct the history of water residence times in the Red Sea. We then use a hydraulic model of the water exchange between the Red Sea and the world ocean to derive the sill depth and hence global sea level-over the past 470,000 years (470 kyr). Our reconstruction is accurate to within +/-12 m, and gives a centennial-scale resolution from 70 to 25 kyr before present. We find that sea-level changes of up to 35 m, at rates of up to 2 cm yr(-1), occurred, coincident with abrupt changes in climate.","Southampton Oceanog Ctr, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; Geol Survey Israel, IL-95501 Jerusalem, Israel; Univ Tubingen, Dept Geol & Paleontol, D-7400 Tubingen, Germany; Univ Gottingen, Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Dept Sedimentary Geol, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",928,10.1038/nature01690,2003

Consequently, the potential of habitat selection by larvae to contribute to these patterns has been largely ignored. To test whether larvae prefer substratum conditioned in the parental habitat, the larvae of 6 common coral species, with contrasting depth distributions, were introduced to aquaria containing settlement tiles conditioned at 2 and 12 m (shallow and deep), plus unconditioned tiles. Goniastrea aspera and G. retiformis, reef-flat species, settled on shallow tiles in densities 4 times greater than on deep tiles. Fungia horrida, a species locally restricted to deeper water, was 6 times more abundant on deep tiles. E repanda, with a similar distribution, settled exclusively on deep tiles. Platygyra daedalea, a species with a wide depth range, settled preferentially on shallow tiles; however, this preference was much less pronounced than in G. aspera or G. retiformis. Leptoria phyrgia, another species with a wide depth range, was equally abundant on deep and shallow substrata. We conclude that the depth distribution of these species is influenced, in part, by substrate preferences of larvae at settlement.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Ctr Coral Reef Biodivers, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; CSIRO Marine Res, Wembley, WA 6913, Australia; Univ Tasmania, Sch Zool, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",88,10.3354/meps252289,2003
