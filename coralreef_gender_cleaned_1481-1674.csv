The impact this has on coral reef fish is receiving increasing attention, with one focal area assessing impacts on fish that feed directly on live coral. It appears that the more specialised a species of corallivore, the more susceptible it is to coral declines. However data are sparse for the Indian Ocean, and little is known about why some corals are preferentially fed upon over others. Here I assess feeding specialisation in three species of coral feeding butterflyfish in the Chagos Archipelago, central Indian Ocean, assess the food quality of the coral genera they target and document patterns of decline in the Seychelles following a severe coral mortality event. Cheatodon trifascialis was the most specialised coral feeder, preferentially selecting for Acropora corals, however, when Acropora was scarce, individuals showed considerable feeding plasticity, particularly for the dominant Pocillopora corals. C. trifasciatus also preferentially fed on Acropora corals, but fed on a much more diverse suite of corals and also displayed some selectivity for Porites. C. auriga is a facultative corallivore and consumed similar to 55% live coral, which lies within the wide range of coral dependence reported for this species. C:N ratio analysis indicated Lobophyllia and Acropora have the highest food quality, with Pocillopora having the lowest, which conforms with diet selection of corallivores and helps explain preferential feeding. Obligate specialist feeders displayed the greatest declines through coral mortality in the Seychelles with obligate generalists also declining substantially, but facultative feeders showing little change. Clearly a greater understanding of the species most vulnerable to disturbance, their habitat requirements and the functional roles they play will greatly assist biodiversity conservation in a changing climate.","Univ Newcastle Upon Tyne, Sch Marine Sci & Technol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",41,"10.1007/s00227-007-0786-x",2007,"Graham, Nicholas A.

One mechanism that may afford habitat generalists greater persistence is their ability to successfully emigrate from degrading environments. This study compared the response of habitat specialist and generalist reef fish species to live coral disturbance. In replicate coral colonies, live coral was experimentally degraded (low, medium and high coral loss). Species continued residence within the colonies was then surveyed over time. In addition, the ability of habitat generalist and specialist species to migrate between degraded (100% loss) and live coral colonies was compared. Habitat specialists exhibited a higher propensity to remain in colonies with low levels of coral loss. However, there was no significant difference between specialist and generalist species in continued residence in habitats with either medium or high levels of coral loss; both functional groups showed low levels of residence. In terms of migration success, generalists moved further than specialists and showed higher levels of successful migration over the majority of distances examined. The influence of habitat specialization on the behavioral response to coral loss may be a useful predictor of changes to coral reef fish communities in response to coral disturbance.","James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Tropical Biol, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",33,"10.1007/s00227-007-0791-0",2007,"Feary, David A.",1

Field observations revealed that mimetic fangblennies were chased by potential victims less often than individuals of a closely related, ecologically and behaviourally similar but non- mimetic species (Plagiotremus tapeinosoma). After attacks, proximity to models protected mimics from retaliation by victims, but the effect of colour similarity was less clear. Both colour resemblance and physical proximity to models thus appear to protect cleaner- fish mimics from aggression by potential and actual victims of their attacks.

When the parasite loads of staghorn damselfish clients were experimentally increased, the attack success of bluestriped fangblenny on damselfish also increased. Enhanced mimic success appeared to be due to relaxation of vigilance by parasitized clients, which sought cleaners more eagerly and had lower overall aggression levels. Signal receivers may therefore be more tolerant of and/or more vulnerable to attacks from aggressive mimics when the net benefit of interacting with their models is high.

Signal receivers may therefore be more tolerant of and/or more vulnerable to attacks from aggressive mimics when the net benefit of interacting with their models is high. Changes in environmental conditions that cause shifts in the net benefits accrued by models and signal receivers may have important implications for the persistence of aggressive mimicry systems.","Univ Queensland, Sch Integrat Biol, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",6,"10.1098/rspb.2007.0543",2007,"Cote, Isabelle M.",2

This study examined the swimming ability and refuging behaviour of a labrid (Halichoeres margaritaceus) and a pomacentrid (Pomacentrus chrysurus) that inhabit high flow, wave-swept coral reef flats. Field observations of refuging patterns were combined with experimental evaluations in a flow tank using a replica of a substratum hole frequently used by these species. Under a range of flow speeds commonly found on the reef flat (0-60 cm s(-1)), flow within the substratum refuge was reduced to speeds of 0-12 cm s(-1), representing a 75-100% flow reduction. Swimming ability of each species was then tested at 60 cm s(-1) with and without access to this flow refuge. Both species were able to maintain activity within the 60 cm s(-1) flow for considerably longer when provided with a refuge, with increases from approximately 39 min to 36 h for H. margaritaceus and 8 min to 88 h for P. chrysurus.

Acoustic telemetry was used to quantify the movements of a large coral reef top predator (Aprion virescens, Lutjanidae; Hawaiian name 'uku') at five atolls in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument (NWHIMNM) from May 2005 to September 2006. The study atolls were located between 23.8 degrees N, 166.2 degrees W and 28.5 degrees N, 178.3 degrees W, and were separated from their nearest receiver-equipped neighbor by distances ranging from 100 to 478 km. No inter-atoll movements by uku were detected but individuals were seasonally site-attached to core activity areas of up to 12 km in length, and ranged up to 19 km across atolls. Within their core areas, tagged uku exhibited diel and tidal habitat shifts, with the latter resulting in round trips of up to 24 km in 24 h. Seasonal uku migrations resulted in extended winter (October-April) absences from summer (May-September) core activity areas and may be linked to summer spawning. Large MPAs (i.e., entire islands, atolls or banks) would probably be required for full protection of resident populations of adult uku, but such 'island-scale' MPAs will not benefit fisheries unless there is significant larval supply from MPAs to neighboring fished areas, or adult emigration over time scales exceeding the 16-month monitoring period of this study. A mixed management strategy of combining smaller MPAs with conventional measures (e.g., minimum size limits, catch, and effort restrictions) may be the best approach for sustaining uku fisheries. However, this would still require relatively large MPAs (12 km in length) to contain uku short-term (diel and tidal) movements, and seasonal migrations would still take uku beyond the boundaries of MPAs of this size. These fluxes across MPA boundaries could supply fish to fisheries but, if high exploitation rates exist, fishing could eliminate key MPA benefits such as increased numbers of large, highly fecund individuals.","Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Zool, Edmonson Hall, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",50,"10.1007/s00227-007-0647-7",2007,"Meyer, Carl G.",1

Large MPAs (i.e., entire islands, atolls or banks) would probably be required for full protection of resident populations of adult uku, but such 'island-scale' MPAs will not benefit fisheries unless there is significant larval supply from MPAs to neighboring fished areas, or adult emigration over time scales exceeding the 16-month monitoring period of this study. A mixed management strategy of combining smaller MPAs with conventional measures (e.g., minimum size limits, catch, and effort restrictions) may be the best approach for sustaining uku fisheries.

These fluxes across MPA boundaries could supply fish to fisheries but, if high exploitation rates exist, fishing could eliminate key MPA benefits such as increased numbers of large, highly fecund individuals.","Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Zool, Edmonson Hall, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",50,"10.1007/s00227-007-0647-7",2007,"Papastamatiou, Yannis P.",2

The study atolls were located between 23.8 degrees N, 166.2 degrees W and 28.5 degrees N, 178.3 degrees W, and were separated from their nearest receiver-equipped neighbor by distances ranging from 100 to 478 km.

A total of 1,665 molluscan individuals from 51 taxa was counted on 44 transects, which covered 220 m(2) at eight diving sites. The most important molluscs in the assemblage were the parasitic gastropod Coralliophila neritoidea, the encrusting gastropod Dendropoma maxima and the coral-associated bivalve Pedum spondyloideum. The dead assemblage, in contrast, was dominated by encrusting bivalves (Ostreoidea, Chamoidea, Spondylidae) and the coral-predating gastropod Drupella cornus. Distinct molluscan assemblages inhabit each of the three fringing reef-habitats and most of the important depth-related community changes occurred within the uppermost 5 m. In contrast, the three deeper fore-reef habitats are characterized by a more uniform molluscan composition. Molluscan assemblages were more dependent on substrata and their coral associations than on water depth. Comparisons with other published studies indicate that reefoidal hard substrata in the northern Red Sea are largely characterized by similar species-abundance patterns. The minor differences to other Red Sea studies probably reflect the northern, isolated position of the Gulf of Aqaba, the lack of certain molluscan habitats, and the differential impact of anthropogenic influences. Strong differences between living and dead assemblages in Aqaba are similar to those observed in other regions and are due to distinct biases in the dead assemblage. Molluscs closely associated with living corals (mostly bivalves and Dendropoma) can easily be overgrown after death and are thus undetectable in visual censuses. Some gastropod taxa are preferentially transported into surrounding soft-substrata postmortem or redistributed by hermit crabs. Such complex relationships between ecology and taphonomy are crucial in evaluating the quality of the molluscan fossil record in coral reef environments. The comparison of our results with literature data documents an increase in coral predators during the last two decades in the northern Red Sea. Due to the greater mollusc biodiversity in the shallower Aqaba reef habitats, damage to this coral reef zone would have the greatest impact on the overall mollusc community.","Univ Vienna, Dept Paleontol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; Univ Vienna, Dept Marine Biol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",22,"10.1007/s00227-007-0656-6",2007,"Zuschin, Martin",1

Employing a unique combination of laboratory performance trials and field observations of swimming speed, this study investigated the comparative performance of pectoral and body-caudal fin swimming within an entire assemblage of coral reef fishes (117 species 10 families). Field observations of swimming behaviour identified three primary modes: labriform (pectoral 70 spp.), subcarangiform (body-caudal 29 spp.) and chaetodontiform (augmented body-caudal 18 spp.). While representative taxa from all three modes were capable of speeds exceeding 50 cm s(-1) during laboratory trials, only pectoral-swimmers maintained such high speeds under field conditions. Direct comparisons revealed that pectoral-swimming species maintained field speeds at a remarkable 70% of their maximum (lab-tested) recorded speed; species using body-caudal fin propulsion maintained field speeds at around 50% of maximum. These findings highlight a profound influence of swimming mode on performance, with the relative mechanical and energetic efficiency of each swimming mode being of major importance. Combining attributes of efficiency, maneuverability and speed in one mode of propulsion, pectoral swimming appears to be a particularly versatile form of locomotion, well suited to a demersal lifestyle on coral reefs.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",49,"10.1007/s00338-007-0195-0",2007,"Fulton, C.

However, movement data obtained with mark-capture techniques are often influenced by artefacts (e.g., displacement, tag-loss, tag-induced injury). To avoid these problems, a novel approach was employed to investigate the movements of an important coral reef palinurid, the painted lobster (Panulirus versicolor). Eighty adult individuals were captured by hand near Northwest Island, Australia. Each lobster was tagged internally (with elastomer) and externally (with plastic zip-ties) to enable both short- (1-10 days) and long-term (6-24 months) observations. Shortly thereafter, all lobsters were manually returned to their shelters (dens). After 6-24 months, 44 lobsters were recaptured, giving an overall recapture rate of 55%. All of these individuals were recaptured within 500 m of their original den, thus indicating a high level of site-fidelity for this species. Short-term observations revealed that individuals moved frequently to and from nearby dens, and that male lobsters typically moved further than female lobsters. It is hypothesized that male lobsters move about their home range more actively, perhaps to seek mating opportunities or to defend resources. The significance of these observations is discussed with respect to the management of this important fishery resource.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Australia Res Council, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",18,"10.1007/s00338-006-0194-6",2007,"Frisch, A.

On coral reefs, spring low tides are recurrent disturbances, but are rarely reported to cause mass mortality. However, in years when extremely low tides coincide with high noon irradiances, they have the potential to cause widespread damage. Here, we report on such an event on a fringing coral reef in the central Great Barrier Reef (Australia) in September 2005. Visual surveys of colony mortality and bleaching status of more than 13,000 corals at 14 reef sites indicated that most coral taxa at wave-protected sites were severely affected by the event. Between 40 and 75% of colonies in the major coral taxa (Acropora, Porites, Faviidae, Mussidae and Pocilloporidae) were either bleached or suffered partial mortality. In contrast, corals at wave-exposed sites were largely unaffected (< 1% of the corals were bleached), as periodic washing by waves prevented desiccation. Surveys along a 1-9 m depth gradient indicated that high coral mortality was confined to the tidal zone. However, 20-30% of faviid colonies were bleached throughout the depth range, suggesting that the increase in benthic irradiances during extreme low tides caused light stress in deeper water. Analyses of an 8-year dataset of tidal records for the area indicated that the combination of extended periods of aerial exposure and high irradiances occurs during May-September in most years, but that the event in September 2005 was the most severe. We argue that extreme low-tide, high-irradiance events are important structuring forces of intertidal coral reef communities, and can be as damaging as thermal stress events.

Microhabitat, composed of a combination of physical complexity and biological elements, always explained the greater part of variability at small (< 1 m) spatial scales.","Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Nelson, New Zealand; Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Biol Evoluz & Sperimentale, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; Univ Bologna, Ctr Interdipartimentale Ricerca Sci Ambientali Ra, I-48100 Ravenna, Italy",20,"10.1007/s00227-006-0586-8",2007,"Willis, Trevor J.",2

Adults formed spawning aggregations of 150 to > 700 individuals at specific sites, and spawning occurred daily at these sites from late April through early June. Courtship occurred throughout the day, but spawning was restricted to the evening hours. Adults spawned in groups of 6-40 fish, and pair-spawning was not observed. The group-spawning behavior of adults and the gonosomatic indices of mature males (maximum = 7.2%) suggest that sperm competition was present. The site-specificity of leopard grouper spawning aggregations and diel spawning period were typical of most aggregating groupers, and the size and structure of these aggregations was similar to other species in the genus Mycteroperca. Leopard grouper behavior patterns were unusual in that spawning aggregations persisted for extended periods, spawning was not synchronized with the lunar cycle, and adults aggregated during non-spawning periods. The extensive duration and site-specificity of spawning aggregations and the propensity of M. rosacea to form aggregations year-round increases the vulnerability of the species to overfishing.

Grazing appears to influence the density and community structure of coral recruits, but no detectable influence was found on the overall size-frequency distribution, community structure, or cover of corals. We interpret this absence of pattern in the adult coral community as symptomatic of the impact of a recent disturbance event that masks the recovery trajectories of individual reefs. Marine reserves are not a panacea for conservation but can facilitate the recovery of corals from disturbance and may help sustain the biodiversity of organisms that depend on a complex three-dimensional coral habitat.","Univ Exeter, Sch Biosci, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA; Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA; Natl MPA Ctr, Marine Protected Areas Sci Inst, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; Amer Museum Nat Hist, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat, New York, NY 10024 USA; Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA; Perry Inst Marine Sci, Jupiter, FL 33477 USA; Univ Sheffield, Dept Probabil & Stat, Sheffield S3 7RH, S Yorkshire, England",215,"10.1073/pnas.0702602104",2007,"Blackwell, Paul G.",10

It is unclear whether the types of temporal patterns and the explanatory power of the adaptive hypotheses are applicable to damselfishes of temperate rocky reefs. This study tested hypotheses about the existence of lunar spawning cycles, the diel timing of hatching, and the synchronization of temporal patterns in hatching and tides in the schooling planktivorous damselfish Chromis hypsilepis on a rocky reef in New South Wales, Australia. Reproductive behaviour was observed daily for 223 days between August 2004 and March 2005. C. hypsilepis formed large spawning aggregations of 3,575-33,075 individuals. Spawning occurred at a uniform rate throughout the day on a semi-lunar cycle. The greatest number of spawnings occurred 1 day after the new moon and 1 day before the full moon. The cost to males from brood care was an 85% reduction in their feeding rate. The semi-lunar spawning cycle may be an outcome of the use of the lunar cue to synchronize the aggregation for spawning of widely dispersed individuals and the need for males to recuperate after brooding. Eggs hatched 3-7 h after sunset following a 4.5-day incubation period. This study provides no support for hypotheses that link temporal patterns in hatching with particular tidal regimes believed to facilitate early survival of larvae and their dispersal. The result that hatching occurred over the tidal cycle was due to the rapid off-reef dispersal of larvae from the spawning ground at all stages of the tide. C. hypsilepis is similar to other planktivorous damselfishes in its semi-lunar spawning cycle, cost of brood care, and protracted diel spawning regime. It differs in its lengthy period of hatching and its breeding in spawning aggregations, believed to be rare among demersally spawning fishes.","Univ Newcastle, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Ourimbah, NSW 2258, Australia",19,"10.1007/s00227-006-0555-2",2007,"Gladstone, William",1

Rates of metabolism of algal turfs are related positively to water motion, consistent with limitation by the diffusion of a substance through a boundary layer. Based on engineering mass transfer theory, we hypothesized that photosynthesis of algal turfs is controlled by rates of mass transfer and responses of photosynthesis to increasing flow speed should be predicted by engineering correlations. This hypothesis was tested in ten experiments where photosynthesis was estimated in a flume/respirometer from changes in dissolved oxygen at eight flow speeds between 0.08 and 0.52 m/s. Flow in the flume and over the reef at Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii was estimated using hot-film thermistor and electromagnetic current meters. Rates of photosynthesis were related positively to flow in all experiments and plots of the log of the average Sherwood number (Sh (meas)) versus log Reynolds number (Re (D)) for each experiment are lower than predicted for mass transfer through a turbulent boundary layer. Algal turf-covered plates are characterized as hydrodynamically transitional to fully rough surfaces and the lower than predicted slopes suggest that roughness reduces rates of mass transfer. A negative correlation between algal turf biomass and slopes of the log Sh (meas)-log Re (D) plots suggests that mass transfer to algal turfs is affected significantly by the physical structure of the algal community. Patterns of photosynthesis based on changes in dissolved oxygen and dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations (DIC) indicate that the flow speed effect is not the result of increased flux of oxygen from the algal turfs, and combined with the short response time to flow speed, suggest that DIC may limit rates of photosynthesis.

Rates of metabolism of algal turfs are related positively to water motion, consistent with limitation by the diffusion of a substance through a boundary layer. Based on engineering mass transfer theory, we hypothesized that photosynthesis of algal turfs is controlled by rates of mass transfer and responses of photosynthesis to increasing flow speed should be predicted by engineering correlations. This hypothesis was tested in ten experiments where photosynthesis was estimated in a flume/respirometer from changes in dissolved oxygen at eight flow speeds between 0.08 and 0.52 m/s. Flow in the flume and over the reef at Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii was estimated using hot-film thermistor and electromagnetic current meters. Rates of photosynthesis were related positively to flow in all experiments and plots of the log of the average Sherwood number (Sh (meas)) versus log Reynolds number (Re (D)) for each experiment are lower than predicted for mass transfer through a turbulent boundary layer. Algal turf-covered plates are characterized as hydrodynamically transitional to fully rough surfaces and the lower than predicted slopes suggest that roughness reduces rates of mass transfer. A negative correlation between algal turf biomass and slopes of the log Sh (meas)-log Re (D) plots suggests that mass transfer to algal turfs is affected significantly by the physical structure of the algal community. Patterns of photosynthesis based on changes in dissolved oxygen and dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations (DIC) indicate that the flow speed effect is not the result of increased flux of oxygen from the algal turfs, and combined with the short response time to flow speed, suggest that DIC may limit rates of photosynthesis. Although there are differences between flow in the flume and flow over algal turfs on the reef, these results suggest that photosynthesis is controlled, at least in part, by mass transfer. The chemical engineering approach provides a framework to pose further testable hypotheses about how algal canopy height, flow oscillation, turbulence, and substratum roughness may modulate rates of metabolism of coral reef algal turfs.","Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA",39,"10.1007/s00227-006-0465-3",2007,"Williams, Susan L.",2

Cytochrome-c oxidase I sequences from tissue samples were used to characterize population structure and infer patterns of gene flow from California to Alaska. No significant genetic structure was found when estimates of Wright's F-ST (i.e., Phi(ST)) were generated among all populations sampled. Nesting populations within regions, however, indicated that the inner coast of Washington State is distinct, a result corroborating previous allozyme work. Coalescent-based estimates of gene flow indicate that although migration can be high from an evolutionary perspective, nearly half of all comparisons among populations showed no gene flow in at least one direction. From an ecological perspective, moderate migration rates (Nm < 10) among most populations provide surprisingly limited connectivity at large (similar to 1,000 km) and small (similar to 100 km) spatial scales. Coalescent-based estimates also show that gene flow between the inner and the outer coasts is asymmetric, a result consistent with prevailing surface currents. Because the expected inter-locus variances for coalescent-based estimates of gene flow are likely large, future work will benefit from analyses of nuclear DNA markers. However, limited demographic connectivity on large spatial scales may help explain why stock recovery has been uneven, with greater recovery in the northern (87% rebuilt) than in the southern (24% rebuilt) fishery region, supporting a regional management strategy.

Analyses of the mutualistic interaction between anemonefish and their host sea anemones show that the relationship is highly nested in structure, generalist species interacting with one another and specialist species interacting mainly with generalists. This supports the hypothesis that the configuration of mutualistic interactions will tend towards nestedness. In this case, the structure of the interaction is at a much larger scale than previously hypothesized, across more than 180 degrees of longitude and some 60 degrees of latitude, probably owing to the pelagic dispersal capabilities of these species in a marine environment.

They, and other isopods, have been shown to significantly affect the health and behaviour of many reef fish. Whether isopod emergence differs among habitats on coral reefs is not known. In this study, we measured emergence rates of parasitic isopods (Gnathiidea and Flabellifera) in six habitats at two sites at Lizard Island during new moon periods in March and December 2004. Isopods were collected from the periphery and centres of micro-reefs, patch reefs, continuous reefs, and from inter-reefal habitats (sand or rubble) with 1 m(2) emergence traps. Sites (Casuarina and Coconut Beach) were located on opposite sides of Lizard Island. Live gnathiids were collected with light traps in November 2005 to investigate species differences between sites. At both sites, the most abundant gnathiid species was exclusive to that site. More gnathiid larvae emerged at night, and emergence of fed gnathiids (pranizae) and flabelliferan isopods was almost exclusively nocturnal. Diurnal emergence was greater at Coconut Beach than Casuarina Beach. Although emergence counts were not consistently affected by parameters such as habitat, site, or sampling period, gnathiid size and feeding state were. Where significant differences existed, gnathiids were larger and more often fed over reef borders than centrally. We suggest first stage larvae (Z1) have the largest influence on total abundance and are patchily distributed in accordance with adults from which they have recently hatched. As later stage larvae depend on fish, more successful (fed) and older larvae are found on the edges of reefs where appropriate hosts may be more abundant, or predation is lower. Gnathiids were over-dispersed in all habitats investigated, including apparently homogeneous beds of coral rubble and sand. This indicates that their distributions may be better predicted by very fine scale differences in substrate or that aggregations are the result of gregariousness and may be difficult to predict on the basis of substrate. Emergence traps collected comparatively few parasitic flabelliferan isopods. This community differed greatly from the previously described community of scavenging isopods at Lizard Island.

This transition to hypoxia tolerance is needed when they settle on the reef; this was strengthened by our finding that small resident larvae of Acanthochromis polyacanthus, a damselfish lacking a planktonic larval stage, do not display such a transition, being well adapted to hypoxia and showing relatively low maximum rates of oxygen uptake that change little with age.","Univ Oslo, Dept Mol Biosci, Phys Programme, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; Univ Queensland, Sch Integrat Biol, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia",45,"10.1098/rspb.2006.3706",2007,"Grutter, Alexandra S.",4

Copepod escape reaction components, including swimming pattern, reactive distance, turning rate, and jump kinetics, were quantified from individual predation events using motion analysis techniques. Among the observed escape reaction components, differences were noted between the species' swimming patterns prior to attack and their response latencies. Temora turbinata was a continuous cruiser and P. parvus exhibited a hop-and-sink swimming pattern. During periods of sinking, P. parvus stopped beating its appendages, which presumably reduced any self-generated hydrodynamic signals and increased perceptual abilities to detect an approaching predator. Response latency was determined for each copepod species using a hydrodynamic stimulus produced by a 1 ms acoustic signal. Response latencies of T. turbinata were significantly longer than those of P. parvus. Despite some apparent perceptual advantages of P. parvus, the blenny successfully captured both species by modifying its attack behavior for the targeted prey.","Univ Texas, Inst Marine Sci, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USA",31,"10.1007/s00227-006-0384-3",2007,"Waggett, Rebecca J.",1

The assemblages were dominated by Clupeiform larvae and juveniles (96.4% of total abundance) and followed by Perciform larvae (3%). The number of taxa per sample varied from less than five in July-August to more than ten in October-November and abundances followed the same seasonal pattern. Analyses of similarity showed significant differences in the assemblages caught in the three bays and analyses of contribution to the dissimilarity revealed that these differences were due to the most abundant families.

Laboratory experiments revealed that corals with crabs shed substantially more of the sediments deposited on coral surfaces, but also that crabs were most effective at removing grain sizes that were most damaging to coral tissues. The mechanism underlying this symbiotic relationship has not been recognized previously, and its role in maintaining coral health is likely to become even more critical as reefs worldwide experience increasing sedimentation.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Coastal Res Ctr, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",57,"10.1007/s00338-006-0132-7",2006,"Brooks, Andrew J.",4

However, only five OTUs could be identified to species and at least three OTUs represent new species unknown in their adult form. In the Red Sea where the identification rate was expected to be 75% in the Gonoclactylidae, none of four larval OTUs could be identified to species; at least two represent new species unknown in their adult forms. Results indicate that the biodiversity in this well-studied group in the Coral Triangle and Red Sea may be underestimated by a minimum of 50% to more than 150%, suggesting a much greater challenge in lesser-studied groups. Although the DNA barcoding methodology was effective, its overall success was limited due to the newly discovered taxonomic limitations of the reference sequence database, highlighting the importance of synergy between molecular geneticists and taxonomists in understanding and documenting our world's biodiversity, both in marine and terrestrial environments.","Boston Univ, Marine Program, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",83,"10.1098/rspb.2006.3540",2006,"Boyce, Sarah L.",2

Recovery from infectious disease may increase if an individual can mount a defense before infection spreads throughout its body. If pathogens spread within an organism from an initial infection point, growth form-in conjunction with size-can influence the amount of time before all the tissue is diseased, and recovery precluded. A simple model of pathogen progression within individual sponges predicts that species with massive growth forms will be most susceptible to being overwhelmed by pathogen infection, and branching species will be most likely to recover. These predictions may help to explain the seemingly contradictory observations that branching species had the greatest prevalence of disease, and massive species the greatest rate of loss, in a monitored coral reef community. Disease may be observed disproportionately frequently in the organisms that are most likely to recover, resulting in underestimation, by standard monitoring procedures, of the effect of disease on losses from the community.","Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",11,"10.1007/s00338-006-0110-0",2006,"Wulff, Janie L.",1

However, because the otolith's edge and core represent different life stages, the deposition of elements may differ, thus complicating direct comparisons of edge and core chemistry to investigate connectivity. Here we present data from a field experiment in which otoliths from embryos (3 days post-fertilization) and juveniles of Stegastes partitus were collected at the same site and time, and chemically analyzed to assess whether elemental concentrations of otoliths vary ontogenetically.

Pachygrapsus crassipes, Portunus xantusii, Cancer spp., Hemigrapsus spp., and Majid crab megalopae dominated the catch. Yearly, seasonal, and daily variations in the magnitude of the catch were observed. Yearly and seasonal variations were probably due to a strong El Nino event that occurred during the study and to the timing of spawning and duration of the larval phase, respectively. Daily variation was correlated with oceanographic processes that can transport larvae to shore. Catch of some taxon during some seasons correlated with wind stress suggesting that transport was wind driven. The correlations were, however, weak and the sign of the correlation varied between years. The maximum daily tidal range was significantly correlated (cross-correlations and cross Fourier analysis) to both daily seawater temperature anomalies (surface and bottom) and daily catch of crab megalopae in all taxa enumerated. Significant correlations between tidal range and temperature anomalies suggest that temperature anomalies were primarily due to the shoreward transport of warm and cold water by the internal tides. The consistent and relatively strong relationship between tidal range and catch of megalopae (the cross-Fourier analysis suggests that from 20 to > 90% of the variation in catch can be attributed to variation in the tidal range) suggest that much of the shoreward transport of megalopae was via the internal tides. Shoreward transport of larvae by internal tides may be due to internal cold bores or convergences over large tidally generated internal waves (solitons). Peak catches of megalopae, however, were often not associated with cold anomalies suggesting that transport was due to moving convergences over internal waves.","Univ Oregon, Oregon Inst Marine Biol, Charleston, OR 97420 USA",34,"10.1007/s00227-005-0162-7",2006,"Shanks, AL",1

This taxon is widely distributed in cryptic coral reef habitats of the Indo-Pacific and is regarded as a modern representative of long-extinct, formerly reef-building stromatoporoid-type sponges. The aims were to clarify phylogeographic and taxonomic relationships in this ""living fossil"" and to explore mitochondrial DNA sequence variation over a wide geographic range. Very low variability was observed across the Indo-Pacific, as only three COI haplotypes were identified, with a maximum p-distance of 0.418% and low nucleotide diversity (pi=0.00049). Very low genetic structure was revealed among populations: Haplotype 1 was found in all specimens from nine Pacific populations (N=45), separated by distances of more than 7,000 km; haplotype 2 was restricted to the Red Sea population (N=4); haplotype 3 was only found in the Tuamoto specimens (N=7). COI data presented here do not support the hypothesis of at least two sibling species belonging to genus Astrosclera in the Pacific. Considering the maximum geographic distance of more than 20,000 km between sampled populations, mtDNA COI sequence variation observed here is among the lowest reported to date for a diploblastic taxon and adds to the growing evidence of a general mtDNA conservation in sponges. It is argued that this low mtDNA variation in A. willeyana s.l. is due to a low rate of mtDNA evolution caused by a combination of long generation time and low metabolic rate.","Univ Gottingen, Geowissensch Zentrum, Abt Geobiol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany",76,"10.1007/s00227-005-0134-y",2006,"Worheide, G",1

Transplanting experiments were carried out to examine the morphological responses of the association to an environmental depth gradient. Simultaneously, we conducted caging experiments to examine the effects of predation (mainly by angelfishes) on association morphology. For this, we transplanted specimens of the association from a control area at 3 m depth to depths of 1 and 5 m, and measured the morphological responses in the association (macro- and microstructure) from the three sites before and after 103 days. The association had the capacity to adjust both macro and micromorphologically, and both external morphology and body structure changed significantly with depth. The specimens grown at 1 m developed a larger surface area of attachment, higher organic density and higher inorganic content than the control specimens at 3 m, and the organisms grown at 5 m depth. We also detected significant differences in the aquiferous system of the sponge, which developed smaller and more numerous oscula at 1 m than at 5 m depth. These differences seem to be consistent with the wave movement as one of the main regulatory factors of the morphology of the association. However, the spicules from H. caerulea were most slender in shallow water, which is not consistent with increasing robustness in the face of greater wave force. The algal skeleton supplied up to 27% of the total inorganic structure of the association; thus, algal contribution significantly reduces the energy costs of spicule production, specifically under high wave exposure, when H. caerulea requires structural reinforcement relative to organic content. The contribution of the sponge to the association (as ratio Si to CaCO3) increased significantly from 3 to 5 m (12% in the uncaged specimens and 22% in the caged specimens), showing that the mutualistic relationship decreases with depth. The production of sponge branches in caged individuals was the most notable difference from uncaged morphs, which could suggest the effect of predators like angelfishes. However, branches could also be a response to the reduction in water movement and irradiance inside the cages. Sponges are known to show morphological acclimation in response to habitat variation, but this is the first study to show it in a sponge living in association with a macroalga.","Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Lab Ecol Bentos, Mazatlan 82000, Mexico; Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Unidad Acad Puerto Morelos, Lab Fotobiol, Cancun 77500, Mexico; Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Postgrado Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Mazatlan, Mexico",27,"10.1007/s00227-005-0104-4",2006,"Carballo, JL",1

The association had the capacity to adjust both macro and micromorphologically, and both external morphology and body structure changed significantly with depth. The specimens grown at 1 m developed a larger surface area of attachment, higher organic density and higher inorganic content than the control specimens at 3 m, and the organisms grown at 5 m depth. We also detected significant differences in the aquiferous system of the sponge, which developed smaller and more numerous oscula at 1 m than at 5 m depth. These differences seem to be consistent with the wave movement as one of the main regulatory factors of the morphology of the association. However, the spicules from H. caerulea were most slender in shallow water, which is not consistent with increasing robustness in the face of greater wave force. The algal skeleton supplied up to 27% of the total inorganic structure of the association; thus, algal contribution significantly reduces the energy costs of spicule production, specifically under high wave exposure, when H. caerulea requires structural reinforcement relative to organic content. The contribution of the sponge to the association (as ratio Si to CaCO3) increased significantly from 3 to 5 m (12% in the uncaged specimens and 22% in the caged specimens), showing that the mutualistic relationship decreases with depth. The production of sponge branches in caged individuals was the most notable difference from uncaged morphs, which could suggest the effect of predators like angelfishes. However, branches could also be a response to the reduction in water movement and irradiance inside the cages. Sponges are known to show morphological acclimation in response to habitat variation, but this is the first study to show it in a sponge living in association with a macroalga.","Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Lab Ecol Bentos, Mazatlan 82000, Mexico; Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Unidad Acad Puerto Morelos, Lab Fotobiol, Cancun 77500, Mexico; Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Postgrado Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Mazatlan, Mexico",27,"10.1007/s00227-005-0104-4",2006,"Avila, E",2

Larvae of 5-14 mm SL were released in the sea, and their swimming speed, depth and direction were observed by divers. Behaviour differed among species, and to some extent, among locations. Swimming speed increased linearly at 0.4-2.0 cm s(-1) per mm size, depending on species. The sciaenid was slower than the sparids by 2-6 cm s(-1) at any size, but uniquely, it swam faster in a sheltered bay than in the ocean. Mean speeds were 4-10 body lengths s(-1). At settlement size, mean speed was 5-10 cm s(-1), and the best performing individuals swam up to twice the mean speed. In situ swimming speed was linearly correlated (R-2=0.72) with a laboratory measure of swimming speed (critical speed): the slope of the relationship was 0.32, but due to a non-zero intercept, overall, in situ speed was 25% of critical speed. Ontogenetic vertical migrations of several metres were found in all three species: the sciaenid and one sparid descended, whereas the other sparid ascended to the surface.

Indications of ontogenetic change in orientated swimming (i.e. the direction of non-random swimming) were found in all three species, with orientated swimming having developed in the sparids by about 8 mm.

This study shows that multibeam echosounders are powerful tools to locate and map deep-water coral reefs irrespective of water depth.","Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Dunstaffnage Marine Lab, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, Scotland; British Geol Survey, Edinburgh EH9 3LA, Midlothian, Scotland; Univ St Andrews, Sch Geog & Geosci, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland",89,"10.1007/s00338-005-0049-6",2005,"Bates, CR",4

Essentially, outbreaks of A. planci could arise from either (1) a single mass recruitment event or (2) the progressive accumulation of starfish from multiple cohorts. This study explored fine-scale variation in the size, distribution, and abundance of A. planci, during an outbreak at Lizard Island in the northern Great Barrier Reef, to assess the mechanism by which the outbreak occurred. Densities of A. planci around Lizard Island increased very gradually from October 1994 until December 1996, then remained at around 1.0 starfish per 200 m(2) until June 1998. The population of A. planci comprised individuals ranging in size from 11-cm to 62-cm diameter, representing individuals from multiple (at least four) different cohorts. These data suggest that the outbreak of A. planci at Lizard Island resulted from a prolonged build-up in starfish numbers through multiple successive recruitment events. This study shows that outbreaks of A. planci may arise independently of any sudden or substantial increase in rates of recruitment, such that any factor(s) responsible for the initial onset of outbreaks are likely to be very subtle and difficult to detect.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Ctr Coral Reef Biodivers, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",64,"10.1007/s00338-005-0006-4",2005,"Pratchett, MS",1

Yet, the role of species interactions for the stability of spatially subdivided communities still eludes ecologists. Ecological models currently address the problem of stability by exploring the role of interaction strength in well mixed habitats, or of connectivity in subdivided communities. Here I propose a unification of interaction strength and connectivity as mechanisms explaining regional community stability. I introduce a metacommunity model based on succession dynamics in coastal ecosystems, incorporating limited dispersal and facilitative interactions. I report a sharp transition in regional stability and extinction probability at intermediate interaction strength, shown to correspond to a phase transition that generates scale-invariant distribution and high regional stability. In contrast with previous studies, stability results from intermediate interaction strength only in subdivided communities, and is associated with large-scale (scale-invariant) synchrony. These results can be generalized to other systems exhibiting phase transitions to show how local interaction strength can be used to resolve the link between regional community stability and pattern formation.","McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada",16,"10.1098/rpb.2005.3118",2005,"Guichard, F",1

The tropical sea anemone Condylactis gigantea inhabits a broad spectrum of coral-reef habitats and displays a variety of phenotypes, particularly with respect to color. At the coast of Discovery Bay, Jamaica, individuals with either pink or green tentacle tips show distinct distributions. Pink morphs are more abundant in the lagoon and in deeper areas, while green morphs are more abundant in the forereef and in shallower areas. We use DNA sequence data ( ITS15.8S) to investigate if variation in color is associated with genetic differentiation in lagoon and forereef habitats about 5 km apart. Population genetic analyses reveal two distinct ITS1-5.8S variants, which differ in relative frequency. The two variants are present in both habitats, but a dearth of intermediates suggests reduced gene flow. In the lagoon, but not the forereef, ITS variants show an association with color. In order to address the potential ecological significance of color, we study UV absorbance and UV acclimatization capacities of pink and green color morphs in the lagoon. Color morphs differed significantly in UV-B absorbance.

The tropical sea anemone Condylactis gigantea inhabits a broad spectrum of coral-reef habitats and displays a variety of phenotypes, particularly with respect to color. At the coast of Discovery Bay, Jamaica, individuals with either pink or green tentacle tips show distinct distributions. Pink morphs are more abundant in the lagoon and in deeper areas, while green morphs are more abundant in the forereef and in shallower areas. We use DNA sequence data ( ITS15.8S) to investigate if variation in color is associated with genetic differentiation in lagoon and forereef habitats about 5 km apart. Population genetic analyses reveal two distinct ITS1-5.8S variants, which differ in relative frequency. The two variants are present in both habitats, but a dearth of intermediates suggests reduced gene flow. In the lagoon, but not the forereef, ITS variants show an association with color. In order to address the potential ecological significance of color, we study UV absorbance and UV acclimatization capacities of pink and green color morphs in the lagoon. Color morphs differed significantly in UV-B absorbance. These results suggest genetic and ecological differentiation in the face of gene flow over short distances.","Tierarztlichen Hsch Hannover, ITZ, D-30559 Hannover, Germany",19,"10.1007/s00227-005-1620-y",2005,"Schierwater, B",2

Movement between patches may be an important modifier of patterns established at settlement, yet local immigration and emigration have received less attention than other demographic rates. I examined loss rates from tagged populations of juvenile wrasses (yellowhead wrasse Halichoeres garnoti and bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum) at two sites in the Bahamas. Assuming that all losses were due solely to mortality would have significantly underestimated survivorship of yellowhead wrasse by 29% and bluehead wrasse by 14%. On average, per capita mortality and emigration rates were higher for yellowhead than bluehead wrasse, but neither demographic rate differed between sites for either species. With respect to within-species density, bluehead wrasse mortality was density-dependent at the patch reef site, but mortality rates of yellowhead wrasse were consistently density-independent. Evaluating the effects of between-species density, yellowhead wrasse mortality increased with a decrease in bluehead wrasse density, but this effect was limited to the patch reef site. Emigration rates were not a function of either within-species or between-species density, but instead varied inversely with isolation distance. Numerous previous studies of coral-reef fish, conducted on patch reefs separated by only a few meters of sand and often using untagged fish, may have confounded losses due to emigration with those due to mortality. A better understanding of the factors affecting emigration in marine fishes is important to their effective management using spatial tools such as marine protected areas.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",11,"10.1007/s00338-005-0477-3",2005,"Overholtzer-McLeod, KL",1

The study was carried out in the waters off South Caicos, Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI), between October 2003 and January 2004. The density of discarded shells was greatest near coral reefs; however, the percentage of shells occupied by adult fish was higher in isolated shells on sand and in mangrove habitats. Juvenile fish also showed a preference for sheltering in conch shells relative to other microhabitat types on sandy plains and in mangrove and seagrass habitats. Differences in use of single shells by fish in different habitats were attributed to differences in piscivore abundance and habitat complexity. Although not all isolated shells were occupied by fish, all conch middens deposited by fishermen had fish inhabitants. Examination of fish use of conch middens in three habitat types and conch piles of one, three, and five shells constructed on sand found both fish diversity and abundance increased on conch middens of increasing size.

The study was carried out in the waters off South Caicos, Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI), between October 2003 and January 2004. The density of discarded shells was greatest near coral reefs; however, the percentage of shells occupied by adult fish was higher in isolated shells on sand and in mangrove habitats. Juvenile fish also showed a preference for sheltering in conch shells relative to other microhabitat types on sandy plains and in mangrove and seagrass habitats. Differences in use of single shells by fish in different habitats were attributed to differences in piscivore abundance and habitat complexity. Although not all isolated shells were occupied by fish, all conch middens deposited by fishermen had fish inhabitants. Examination of fish use of conch middens in three habitat types and conch piles of one, three, and five shells constructed on sand found both fish diversity and abundance increased on conch middens of increasing size.

The feeding behavior of two species of tube-dwelling coral reef fish (Chaenopsidae) was studied in still and turbulent water. One species of blenny, Acanthemblemaria spinosa , lives in holes higher above the reef surface and feeds mainly on calanoid copepods, while a second, A. aspera , lives closer to the reef surface, feeds mainly on harpacticoid copepods, and is exposed to less water motion than the first. In the laboratory, these two blenny species were video recorded attacking a calanoid copepod ( Acartia tonsa, evasive prey) and an anostracan branchiopod (nauplii of Artemia sp., passive prey). Whereas A. spinosa attacked with the same vigor in still and turbulent water, A. aspera modulated its attack with a more deliberate strike under still conditions than turbulent conditions. For both fish species combined, mean capture success when feeding on Artemia sp. was 100% in still water and dropped to 78% in turbulent water. In contrast, when feeding on Acartia tonsa, mean capture success was 21% in still water and rose to 56% in turbulent water. We hypothesize that, although turbulence reduces capture success by adding erratic movement to Artemia sp. (passive prey), it increases capture success of Acartia tonsa (evasive prey) by interfering with the hydrodynamic sensing of the approaching predator. These opposite effects of water motion increase the complexity of the predator-prey relationship as water motion varies spatially and temporally on structurally complex coral reefs.

Symbiodinium clade D was associated with corals that inhabit either shallow water or the reef edge in deep water, supporting the hypothesis that Symbiodinium clade D is a relatively stress-tolerant zooxanthellae found in marginal habitats.","Acad Sinica, Inst Zool, Taipei 115, Taiwan; Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 106, Taiwan; Penghu Aquarium, Taiwan Fisheries Res Inst, Makung 880, Penghu, Taiwan; Natl Museum marine Biol Aquarium, Hengchun 946, Pingtung, Taiwan",58,"10.1007/s00338-004-0389-7",2005,"Fang, LS",5

We surveyed 969 labrid fishes from the tropical Pacific and found bucephalids only in cleaners (Lahroides dimidiatus, L. bicolor, and Bodianus axillaris) and none in piscivores. The prevalences of bucephalids in L. dimidiatus at Lizard Island, Heron Island, Orpheus Island (all on the Great Barrier Reef), New Caledonia, and Moorea (French Polynesia) were 51, 47, 67, 56, and 67%, respectively.

A distinctive biogeographic break between the kinds of symbionts found in Sorites from the East Pacific and Caribbean was clearly evident. Differences between cnidarian and foraminferan symbioses in each ocean may be explained by the subjection of Caribbean communities to severer environmental conditions during the early Quarternary. Caribbean Sorites spp. harbored symbionts described from clade F (specifically sub-clade Fr4) and clade H ( formally referred to as Fr1), while Sorites spp. from the eastern Pacific were dominated by a single Symbiodinium haplotype in clade C. An ITS 2 phylogeny determined that most clade C ""types'' recovered from Indo-Pacific soritids form a monophyletic sub-lineage with other clade C symbionts typically found in Pacific corals from the genus Porites.

Differences between cnidarian and foraminferan symbioses in each ocean may be explained by the subjection of Caribbean communities to severer environmental conditions during the early Quarternary. Caribbean Sorites spp. harbored symbionts described from clade F (specifically sub-clade Fr4) and clade H ( formally referred to as Fr1), while Sorites spp. from the eastern Pacific were dominated by a single Symbiodinium haplotype in clade C. An ITS 2 phylogeny determined that most clade C ""types'' recovered from Indo-Pacific soritids form a monophyletic sub-lineage with other clade C symbionts typically found in Pacific corals from the genus Porites. The existence of multiple Symbiodinium lineages at various taxonomic levels associated specifically with soritids indicates that symbioses with these hosts are important in driving Symbiodinium spp. evolution.","Univ Geneva, Dept Zool & Anim Biol, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland; Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA",83,"10.1007/s00227-004-1427-2",2004,"LaJeunesse, TC",2

As with the many cnidarian invertebrates that inhabit these systems, they also depend on symbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium) for their growth and survival.

In contrast, the distributions of Symbiodinium spp. from clades A, B, and C are more evenly apportioned across Caribbean invertebrate communities. To explore the possibility that a similar biogeographic break exists in the symbionts harbored by soritids, we surveyed the Symbiodinium spp. from the soritid genus Sorites, collected from the Pacific and Caribbean coasts of Panama as well as from Florida.

The study was conducted in Moorea, French Polynesia (17degrees32'S; 149degrees50'W), from 31 December 1994 to 11 March 1995. For gonadal histology, two populations were sampled, one consisting of large aggregations (n = 54) and the other consisting of small- to medium-sized groups around isolated corals (n = 55). An additional small sample (n = 21) was also collected from a population that consisted of small groups around isolated corals. After an initially undifferentiated state, gonads of D. flavicaudus developed an ovarian lumen, followed by oocytes in the primary growth stage. From this ovarian state or from more developed ovaries with cortical-alveolus stage oocytes, some gonads developed into testes through degeneration of oocytes and development of spermatogenic tissue. In all three populations, spermatogenic tissue developed only in gonads that contained pre-vitellogenic oocytes ( termed as mixed stage 1 - 2 gonads). The two main populations did not differ in their expression of sex change despite differences in their social organization. In both populations, size of individuals with mixed stage 1 - 2 gonads overlapped mainly with the size range of immature females, which suggests that functional female-to-male sex change was rare. The hypothesis that D. flavicaudus is primarily gonochoristic is further supported by removal experiments in laboratory groups, in which removal of a dominant male(s) failed to induce sex change in any of the high-ranking females. Yet, in all three field populations, some fish with mixed stage 1 - 2 gonads were found within the size ranges of mature females, which indicates possible occurrences of functional sex change. These conflicting results indicate that it may be premature to draw any definitive conclusions about the sexual pattern of D. flavicaudus.","Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; Ochanomizu Univ, Dept Biol, Tokyo 112, Japan; Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Zool, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",10,"10.1007/s00227-004-1414-7",2004,"Asoh, K",1

A transplant experiment was conducted in which staghorn corals (Acropora formosa) were exposed to the polyps of Rhodactis rhodostoma to establish how competition between corals and corallimorpharians affects their respective distributions. Within reefs corallimorpharians seemed to be more competitive in shallow waters. This could be due to both environmental factors as well as varied competitive abilities depending on surrounding benthos that changed with depth. Reef environment also seemed to influence corallimorpharian growth among reefs as they had the highest densities in the areas with the highest nutrient loads. The transplant experiment revealed that the corallimorpharians had a competitive advantage over the corals, and in comparisons of reefs influenced by different degrees of disturbance, corallimorpharians were most competitive in the area with the highest nutrient content. Hence, stress on coral reefs in the form of raised nutrient loads may favour the competitive success of corallimorpharians.","Univ Stockholm, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; Univ Dar Es Salaam, Fac Aquat Sci & Technol, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania",20,"10.1007/s00227-004-1376-9",2004,"Wagner, GM",4

The foraging grounds range from coral reef habitats at the north-western end of the archipelago, to coastal habitats around the main islands at the southeastern end of the archipelago. Pelagic juveniles recruit to these neritic foraging grounds from ca. 35 cm SCL or 5 kg ( similar to 6 years of age), but grow at foraging-ground-specific rates, which results in quite different size- and age-specific growth rate functions. Growth rates were estimated for the five populations as change in straight carapace length ( cm SCL year) 1) and, for two of the populations, also as change in body mass ( kg year) 1). Expected growth rates varied from ca. 0 - 2.5 cm SCL year) 1, depending on the foraging-ground population, which is indicative of slow growth and decades to sexual maturity, since expected size of first-time nesters is greater than or equal to 80 cm SCL. The expected size- specific growth rate functions for four populations sampled in the southeastern archipelago displayed a non-monotonic function, with an immature growth spurt at ca. 50 - 53 cm SCL ( similar to 18 - 23 kg) or ca. 13 - 19 years of age. The growth spurt for the Midway atoll population in the northwestern archipelago occurs at a much larger size ( ca. 65 cm SCL or 36 kg), because of slower immature growth rates that might be due to a limited food stock and cooler sea surface temperature. Expected age-at-maturity was estimated to be ca. 35 - 40 years for the four populations sampled at the south-eastern end of the archipelago, but it might well be > 50 years for the Midway population. The Hawaiian stock comprises mainly the same mtDNA haplotype, with no differences in mtDNA stock composition between foraging-ground populations, so that the geographic variability in somatic growth rates within the archipelago is more likely due to local environmental factors rather than genetic factors. Significant temporal variability was also evident, with expected growth rates declining over the last 10 - 20 years, while green turtle abundance within the archipelago has increased significantly since the mid-1970s. This inverse relationship between somatic growth rates and population abundance suggests a density-dependent effect on somatic growth dynamics that has also been reported recently for a Caribbean green turtle stock. The Hawaiian green turtle stock is characterised by slow growth rates displaying significant spatial and temporal variation and an immature growth spurt. This is consistent with similar findings for a Great Barrier Reef green turtle stock that also comprises many foraging-ground populations spanning a wide geographic range.","Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",77,"10.1007/s00227-004-1387-6",2004,"Balazs, GH",1

The two species in this study displayed different lipid class compositions and total lipid depletions following bleaching, suggesting that there is a difference in their metabolism of lipid reserves and/or in their temporal responses to bleaching and recovery.","Univ Penn, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",134,"10.1007/s00227-004-1337-3",2004,"Juarez, C",3

Inside the reefs, decreases in crab density of each newly settled cohort mirror the ratio of decreases in the number of reef refuges of similar sizes, suggesting that habitat fractal structure determines the mortality rate after settlement. Field experiments using artificial shelters show that as crabs increase in size, they move outside reefs. Field tethering of juvenile- and adult-sized crabs without access to refuges showed that juvenile crabs suffer a much higher risk of mortality than adults. Our results show that the availability of small refuges provided by polychacte reefs enhances crab settlement, but, then, due to a decrease in the number of refuges as size increases, produces a demographic bottleneck during recruitment. Thus, independent of settlement intensity, enhanced survivorship in the smallest size classes due to refuge is not transmitted to larger size classes.

Coral reef fishes are regularly exposed to potentially harmful radiation. It was recently discovered that tropical marine fishes possess UV-absorbing compounds in their mucus. This experiment demonstrates significant effects of both diet and ultraviolet exposure on the UV-absorbing compounds in the mucus of a tropical wrasse, Thalassoma duperrey. Fish that are exposed to UV radiation increase the UV absorbance of their mucus only if UV-absorbing compounds are provided in their diet. Fish that are protected from UV radiation decrease the UV absorbance of their mucus regardless of diet. Mucus from female T. duperrey absorbed less UV and females had higher rates of skin damage than males. Females sequester UV-absorbing compounds in their pelagic eggs as well as their epithelial mucus, whereas males do not sequester these compounds in the testes. Spectral transmission through the whole eye was not affected by diet or UV manipulations, but corneal tissue transmission decreased significantly in the UV-exposed individuals.

However, the application of spectral unmixing on coral reefs is fundamentally challenging, due not only to the water column, but also to the potentially large number of spectrally similar and ecologically significant end-member (substratum) classes involved. A controlled ex-situ experiment was conducted using field-spectrometer data to assess the accuracy of spectral unmixing techniques to estimate the areal cover of small-scale (<0.25 m(2)) assemblages of reef substrata (e.g., changes in cover between massive corals, branching corals, bleached corals, macroalgae, and coralline red algae). Mixture compositions were obtained precisely by analysis of digital images collected by a camera calibrated to the field of view of the spectrometer. Linear unmixing techniques were applied to derive estimates of substratum proportions using the full spectral resolution data and various transformations of it, including derivatives and down sampling (merging adjacent wavelengths into broader spectral bands). Comparison of actual and estimated substratum proportions indicate that spectral unmixing may be a practical approach for estimating subpixel-scale cover of coral reef substrata. In the most accurate treatment, coefficients of determination across all mixture sets were high for most end-member classes (37 of 52 cases with r(2) >0.64, i.e. r >0.8). The most successful analyses were based on derivatives of down-sampled data, implying that spectral unmixing benefits more from spectral smoothing and judicious choice of band locations than from high spectral resolution per se.

Simultaneous measurements of turbidity depth-profile and above-water spectral reflectance integrated according Landsat 7 ETM+ band 2 spectral sensitivity provide a linear regression relationship for the southwest lagoon of New Caledonia (r(2)=0.95, n=40). This relationship is applied to an empirically atmospherically corrected Landsat ETM+ image of the lagoon acquired on October 23, 2002. A comparison between Landsat estimates of turbidity and concurrent measurements at 14 stations indicates that the mean standard error in the satellite-estimated turbidity is 17.5%. The numerical model introduced in Douillet et al. (2001) is used to simulate the transport of fine suspended sediments in the lagoon in October 2002.

This study measured spectral reflectance from 17 species of western Caribbean reef biota including coral, algae, seagrasses, and sediments, as well as healthy and diseased coral. It sought to extend the spectral library of reef-associated species found in the literature and to test the spectral discrimination of a hierarchy of habitats, community groups, and species. We compared results from hyperspectral reflectance and derivative datasets to those simulated for the three visible multispectral wavebands of the IKONOS sensor. The best discriminating subset of wavelengths was identified by multivariate stepwise selection procedure (discriminant function analysis). Best discrimination at all levels was obtained using the derivative dataset based on 6-15 non-contiguous wavebands depending on the level of the classification, followed by the hyperspectral reflectance dataset which was based on as few as 2-4 non-contiguous wavebands. IKONOS wavebands performed worst. The best discriminating subset of wavelengths in the three classification resolutions, and particularly those of the medium resolution, was in agreement with those identified by Hochberg and Atkinson (2003) and Hochberg et al.

At all levels of classification, reflectance wavebands selected by the analysis were similar to those reported in recent studies carried out elsewhere, confirming their applicability in different biogeographical regions.

Peaks in the Mn signal were observed during the ablation of cores from some sprat and reared herring otoliths, indicating that incubation on a gravel substrate is not necessary for the accumulation of Mn at the otolith core and that otoliths from both pelagic and demersally spawning fish species can contain elevated Mn concentrations. The results suggest that Mn concentrations at the otolith core do not reflect the external environment of the developing embryo. Two other hypotheses are considered. A dramatic increase in Mn concentrations in the egg, associated with embryological development, may produce elevated Mn levels at the otolith core. Alternatively, the high levels of Mn observed at the otolith core may reflect spatial variation in the crystal structure of the calcium carbonate portion of the otolith. The possible influence of physiological or structural factors on the chemical composition of the otolith core may confound the environmental signal in this region of the otolith. This has important implications for the interpretation of otolith chemistry data.","Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Dublin, Dept Zool, Dublin 4, Ireland; Nat Hist Museum, Dept Mineral, London SW7 5BD, England",104,"10.1007/s00227-003-1240-3",2004,"Danilowicz, BS",3

Visual censuses of the distribution and abundance of labrids across two major gradients of wave exposure (depth and aspect to prevailing winds) were made at two offshore islands near Port Stephens, New South Wales, Australia. Distinct shifts in species composition and abundance were evident between high and low wave exposure habitats on temperate rocky reefs, particularly between deep and shallow habitats on exposed reef fronts. The swimming performances of temperate labrids were assessed through examination of pectoral fin shape (aspect ratio) and in situ swimming speeds. A diversity of pectoral fin morphologies was exhibited within this temperate assemblage, ranging from rounded to tapered fins (aspect ratios of 0.52 and 1.43, respectively). Fin shape was strongly correlated (Pearson's correlation 0.884, P<0.001) with swimming speed (ranging from 1.05 and 3.06 body lengths s(-1)), in a relationship comparable to that observed in tropical labrids. Inter-specific differences in swimming ability provided some explanation for differences in the distribution and abundance of temperate labrids in relation to wave exposure. However, our findings suggest that although coral reef labrids appear to predominantly use high aspect-ratio fins to successfully occupy wave-exposed habitats, temperate labrids appear to be using an enhanced swimming ability through increased body size.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Dept Marine Biol, Ctr Coral Reep Biodivers, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",57,"10.1007/s00227-003-1216-3",2004,"Fulton, CJ",1

Two western Atlantic species T. bifasciatum (Bloch, 1791) from the Caribbean and T. noronhanum (Boulenger, 1890) from Brazil served as outgroups. Tissues from a total of 132 individuals were sequenced. T. newtoni from Sao Tome preferentially grouped with the central Atlantic T. sanctaehelenae and T. ascensionis. T. pavo exhibits two distinct coloration patterns, one in the Cape Verde Islands and one in the eastern Atlantic Islands and Mediterranean. However, no genetic discontinuities between the Cape Verde Islands and the remaining samples or between Atlantic and Mediterranean individuals were found. Within Mediterranean populations of T. pavo, our data suggested the presence of a genetic break between eastern and western regions.","Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; Univ Naples 2, Dipartimento Sci Vita, I-81100 Caserta, Italy; Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama; Univ Lecce, CoNISMa, DiSTeBA, Lab Zool & Marine Biol, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; Univ Acores, Dept Oceanog & Pesca, Ctr IMAR, PT-99018862 Horta Azores, Portugal; Univ Algarve, Ctr Ciencias Mar, P-8000117 Faro, Portugal; Cornell Univ, Shoals Marine Lab, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",36,"10.1007/s00227-003-1200-y",2004,"Heiser, JB",6

At least 41 species of fish were sampled, of which 78% were marine, 17% were estuarine, and 5% were freshwater. Juveniles were sampled in 41% of the species, and 5 and 6 species occurred exclusively in mangrove and mudflat habitats, respectively. The assemblage structure of fishes varied significantly between habitats (for both fyke and seine catches) and between spring and summer (seine catches), but only in one bay. Most of the variability between habitats and times of the year could be explained by differences in abundances of atherinids, mugulids, gobiids, tetraodontids, pleuronectids, and clupeids. Fyke nets sampled mainly juvenile and smaller species of fish. Fish abundance was always greater in mangroves than mudflats (but significantly so at four of the six study sites) and varied significantly between times of the year at one site, while the number of species varied significantly between times of the year at three sites. Gill nets sampled mostly adult/subadult fishes and abundances were greater in mudflats than mangroves at two sites, and in mangroves over mudflats at one site, while species abundance varied between times of the year at two sites. The seine net sampled mainly early post-settlement and small (<20 mm) fishes, more species of which were sampled in mudflat than mangrove during winter and spring, whereas the opposite pattern occurred in summer and autumn. The number of fish sampled with the seine net only varied significantly between habitats in one embayment during summer and spring, when they were larger and smaller, respectively, in mangroves than mudflats. Mangrove habitat in temperate Australian waters supports a richer juvenile fish assemblage than adjacent mudflats, but there is little difference between habitats for the subadult/adult assemblage. Ultimately, the 'value' of mangrove habitats to fishes depends strongly on when and where (bays and sites within bays) the study is done.","Univ Melbourne, Primary Ind Res Victoria, Queenscliff 3225, Australia; Univ Melbourne, Dept Zool, Queenscliff 3225, Australia",45,"10.1007/s00227-003-1201-x",2004,"Hindell, JS",1

Fish species that were attracted to the AMUs were identified and counted and the effects of shade and structural complexity, as well as the interaction between the two factors, were tested. Diurnal fish showed a preference for the greatest structured complexity and for a moderate increase in shade. Two nocturnal species common in local mangroves as well as seagrass beds showed statistically significant effects: densities of Haemulon sciurus were positively related to both shade and structural complexity, whereas only shade had a significant positive effect on densities of Ocyurus chrysurus. The experiment indicated that the attractiveness of mangrove vegetation for H. sciurus may be influenced by the structural complexity of the habitat as well as by the degree of shade, and that both factors are equally and separately important.
