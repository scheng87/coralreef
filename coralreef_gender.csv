In coral reef environments, this information remains fragmentary. Here, based on 314 species sorted according to a set of 10 functional traits, the functional niches of macroalgae at three remote coral reefs of the iles Eparses in the Indian Ocean (Europa, Glorioso, and Juan de Nova) are described. For the comparison of intra- and inter-reef functional structures, we characterized both taxonomic and functional beta diversities, and their turnover and nestedness-resultant components. Within the three reefs, we observed strong taxonomic and functional dissimilarities across sampling sites, mainly determined by turnover. Null models highlighted several processes, which structured macroalgal assemblages across sites: a combined effect of environmental variables (geomorphology and wave exposure), limiting similarity and stochastic effects. At the inter-reef scale, the three reefs only shared a small number of species, but the functional beta diversity between Glorioso and Juan de Nova was weak. This suggested that although assemblages were different, fairly similar environmental conditions may have homogenized macroalgae functions through both ecological and evolutionary scale processes. Our results support the idea that macroalgal assemblages can provide similar functional trait portfolios, despite distinct species composition. We stress the need to focus on macroalgae life-history traits for a better understanding of the processes structuring their communities.","[Loiseau, Nicolas; Grellier, M.; Zubia, M.] Univ Polynesie Francaise, UMR EIO 241, LabEx CORAIL, BP 6570, F-98702 Faaa, French Polynesi, Fr Polynesia; [Loiseau, Nicolas] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, MARBEC, IRD,IFREMER, F-34095 Montpellier, France; [Payri, C.

On a reef scale, coral mucus functions as a particle trap, thereby retaining nutrients and energy in the ecosystem. Given the distinct environmental conditions in the Red Sea (high temperature, high salinity, high total alkalinity), we sought to investigate the carbohydrate composition of mucus from five corals from the central Red Sea. Our aim was to assess whether mucus from Red Sea corals is different from what is known from other corals and whether those differences could be aligned to putative beneficial functions with regard to the prevailing environment. Using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, we detected nine sugars as the main prevalent carbohydrates. Although we detected significant differences between species with regard to the relative abundance of given carbohydrates, the identified sugars resembled those found in mucus from corals elsewhere, and we could corroborate high abundance of arabinose in acroporid corals. Taken together, our results suggest the presence of a common set of carbohydrates across a broad range of coral species from geographically diverse environments, highlighting the important role of mucus with regard to coral and reef ecosystem function.","[Hadaidi, G.; Gegner, H.

To explore regeneration, circular lesions (12mm diameterx3mm depth) were created in the fall of 2014 on 124 Montastraea cavernosa colonies located in the coastal waters of Grenada and Carriacou (10-12m depth). Coral regeneration was documented at weekly intervals for 28days. Repeated measures ANOVA on estimated weekly coral regeneration rates showed that island (p=0.024) and colony colour (p=0.024) were the only factors significantly affecting lesion regeneration. Mean rate of lesion closure during the first 28days was approximately 2.8mm(2)d(-1). Four identical circular lesions were created on 30 M. cavernosa colonies (Carriacou, 10-12m depth) in the fall of 2015. One representative lesion created on each coral colony was re-sampled at each of 14, 21, and 32 or 33days following injury, and coral tissue was flash-frozen. Tissues from 10 normally pigmented brown colonies were selected for proteomic analysis using tandem mass tags. The initial polyp sample, the day 14, and the final samples were used to quantify the difference in protein abundance as the lesions healed. In the tissue samples 6419 peptides were reliably identified, which corresponded to 906 unique proteins. During the first month of regeneration, 111 proteins were differentially abundant (p<0.05) on at least one timepoint and of these, 11 were associated with regeneration. An additional 14 proteins were also identified that were differentially abundant (p<0.05) and were associated with inflammation or antioxidant activity.

The obligate coral-dwelling fish, Gobiodon histrio, is thought to make habitat choices based on the coloration and structural characteristics of Acropora nasuta, their preferred coral host. Yet, most studies on the habitat preference of G. histrio have been conducted on Australia's Great Barrier Reef with no understanding if geographic differences in preferences exist. Here, we tested the habitat preference of G. histrio toward A. nasuta on the reefs of Kadavu and Tavewa Islands, Fiji. First, to assess the natural distribution, belt transect surveys of all acroporid corals were conducted. Transects indicated that, while G. histrio is most frequently found in A. nasuta over other acroporid corals, the coral's structural characteristics rather than the coral's color variation were the preferred characteristic. In contrast, the Australian G. histrio have been found to be more frequent in blue A. nasuta opposed to the brown color variation, suggesting a geographic difference in habitat preferences among the species. In addition, we conducted two in situ behavioral field experiments to determine whether G. histrio would (1) move from dead A. nasuta to a live brown or blue A. nasuta and (2) preferentially select between the brown- or blue-colored A. nasuta when placed on a dead A. nasuta. The results of the in situ experiments support the finding that Fijian G. histrio does not discriminate between A. nasuta using color but uses only structural morphologies to guide its habitat selection process. Habitat selection is a complex process, and microscale habitat preferences within a species can vary between geographic locations. This study sheds light on the need to expand research findings to incorporate large geographic regions when attempting to understand the preferences of coral reef symbionts.","[Leingang, Paul M.; Dixson, Danielle L.] Univ Delaware, Sch Marine Sci & Policy, 700 Pilottown Rd, Lewes, DE 19958 USA",0,10.1007/s00338-018-01744-x,2019

We exposed juvenile anemonefish (Amphiprion melanopus) to two suspended sediment concentrations (0 or 180mgL(-1)) for 7d and examined their predator escape performance and anti-predator behaviour in both clear water and suspended sediments (0 and 180mgL(-1), i.e. acute exposure). After 7-d exposure to suspended sediments, fish responded faster to a mechanical stimulus and exhibited enhanced fast starts compared to individuals reared in clear water, regardless of acute exposure. Fish were also less active and avoided open areas when exposed to elevated suspended sediments in the test arena when compared to clear water, irrespective of prior 7-d exposure. While these changes are likely strategies to compensate for an increased perceived predation risk in suspended sediments, they may also be associated with non-consumptive costs for juveniles living on turbid reefs.","[Hess, Sybille; Hoey, Andrew S.; Jarrold, Michael D.; Rummer, Jodie L.] ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Hess, Sybille; Jarrold, Michael D.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Allan, Bridie J.

This study presents the chronic effects (of measured, long-term and low concentrations) of some preservatives (ethylparaben, butylparaben), mineral UV filter (zinc oxide, ZnO) and organic UV filters (terephthalylidene dicamphor sulfonic acid, drometrizole trisiloxane, ethylhexyltriazone, butylmethoxydibenzoylmethane and 2-ethylhexyl 2-cyano-3,3-diphenylacrylate) on the maximal photosynthetic efficiency (F-v/F-m) of the symbionts associated with the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata. It first shows that for many organic filters, measured concentrations were significantly lower than nominal concentrations, due to the lipophilic nature of the compounds. In addition, the F-v/F-m was more sensitive to ZnO than all other sunscreen ingredients, with exposure to 90 mu gL(-1) ZnO for 35d, reducing F-v/F-m by 38% compared with controls. The other UV filters tested showed no adverse effect on coral symbionts or animal tissue up to the concentration corresponding to their water solubility limit (and even above). Similarly, no adverse effect was observed in our conditions with the preservative ethylparaben, but the preservative butylparaben decreased the F-v/F-m by 25% at the highest concentration of 100 mu gL(-1). None of the sunscreen ingredients were as toxic to corals as the reference pollutants tributyltin, diuron and monuron, which significantly inhibited F-v/F-m at 10, 1 and 0.1 mu gL(-1), respectively. Overall, this study highlights the need to improve our knowledge on the in situ concentrations of UV filters and preservatives as well as their individual and combined effects on corals.","[Fel, Jean-Pierre; Lacherez, Catherine; Bensetra, Alaa; Mezzache, Sakina; Leonard, Marc] LOreal Res & Innovat, Aulnay Sous Bois, France; [Beraud, Eric; Allemand, Denis; Ferrier-Pages, Christine] Ctr Sci Monaco, 8 Quai Antoine Ier, MC-98000 Monaco, Monaco",0,10.1007/s00338-018-01759-4,2019

Previous simulations of seawater warming on coral reef sediments found a decline in the GPP/R ratio and an associated increase in CaCO3 dissolution but were only conducted over a short timescale (<24h). To date, no studies have examined the prolonged (>24h) effect of seawater warming on coral reef CaCO3 sediment metabolism and dissolution, which may allow the benthic community to acclimatise. This study used 600-L flume aquaria to examine the effect of seawater warming on GPP, R, and CaCO3 dissolution in the permeable coral reef CaCO3 sediments of Mo'orea, French Polynesia, over a period of 15d. On average, when exposed to warmed seawater (+2.8 degrees C), R in the CaCO3 sediments was enhanced (+58%) to a greater extent than GPP (+19%), resulting in a decline in GPP/R (-23%) and an associated increase in net CaCO3 dissolution (+126%). The magnitude of these warming-mediated metabolic changes increased each day until reaching a plateau after about 8d, indicating that 24-h experiments may be underestimating the effect of warming over longer timescales. Interestingly, the increase in dissolution relative to control treatments was more striking during the day (+163%) than at night (+89%), suggesting that warming acted to both enhance geochemical dissolution and reduce biogenic calcification or inorganic precipitation. Together, these data indicate that, over the timescale observed here, photosynthesis and associated inorganic and biogenic CaCO3 precipitation do not exhibit the ability to counterbalance the warming-mediated increase in sediment heterotrophy and CaCO3 dissolution.","[Lantz, Coulson A.; Schulz, Kai G.; Eyre, Bradley D.] Southern Cross Univ, Ctr Coastal Biogeochem, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Mil Rd, Lismore, NSW 2480, Australia",0,10.1007/s00338-018-01752-x,2019

Here, we describe the underwater light on a reef off St. John, US Virgin Islands (18 degrees 1837.04N, 63 degrees 4323.17W), during two hurricanes and multiple tropical waves that occurred between 17 August 2017 and 30 November 2017. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was recorded at 19-m depth and at the surface, and rainfall was measured as a cause of turbidity affecting underwater light. Hurricanes Irma and Maria reduced maximum daily underwater photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) to<14 mu mol photons m(-2)s(-1) (<0.001% of surface PPFD) and, from 1 September to 30 November, were associated with rainfall that was higher (107cm) than has been recorded over this period since 1972. These reductions in underwater PPFD are unprecedented since at least 2014, and the corresponding values of the diffuse attenuation coefficients (Kd-PAR 0.268-0.426) are among the lowest recorded on a coral reef. Our study reveals the capacity for hurricanes to render a photic habitat temporarily aphotic, and over 69days (and relative to 2016), to contribute to a 20% reduction in summed, daily integrated underwater PPFD. Large reductions in underwater PPFD have negative implications for photosynthetic taxa, but through the turbidity that reduces underwater light, they create opportunities for population growth by suspension feeding invertebrates.","[Edmunds, Peter J.; Tsounis, Georgios] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, 18111 Nordhoff St, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; [Boulon, Ralf] 5000 Estate Enighed,PMB 68, St John, VI 00830 USA; [Bramanti, Lorenzo] UPMC Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, Lab Ecogeochim Environm Benth LECOB, CNRS,Observ Oceanol Banyuls Sur Mer, 1 Ave Pierre Fabre, F-66650 Banyuls Sur Mer, France",0,10.1007/s00227-018-3459-z,2019

Understanding how food resources are used and whether the diets of neighboring species are different are particularly important when considering the coexistence and functional role of species. Territorial damselfish on coral reefs are considered to be herbivores that defend algal mats from other food competitors. However, this guild contains numerous small species whose functional role and dietary diversification is poorly understood. Here, the relationships between diet and spatial distribution of seven intermediate-sized territorial damselfishes at Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea (5 degrees 30S, 150 degrees 05E) were investigated. These species partition habitat across three reef zones with distinct patterns of fine-scale distribution. It was predicted that neighboring species partition food resources with minimal dietary overlap. Examination of isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen delineated three distinct feeding strategies: pelagic, reef-based, and an intermediate group feeding on both prey types. None of the species appear to be strict herbivores. Adjacent species exhibited high-intermediate trophic niche partitioning when examining pelagic versus reef-based production sources, with two species previously described as benthic herbivores exhibiting pelagic feeding. The study demonstrates that diet reinforces the patterns of spatial partitioning and coexistence among ecologically similar damselfishes. These findings add to a growing view that interspecific differences among similar species are lost when categorizing species into broad functional classifications, and that previous studies suggesting that territorial damselfish are strictly reef-based feeders may not be applicable in all systems or for all species.","[Eurich, J.

These events were predominantly caused by thermal anomalies, which vary widely in terms of severity and spatio-temporal distribution. Acropora corals, highly prominent contributors to the structural complexity of Pacific coral reefs, are sensitive to thermal stress. Response of Acropora corals to extremely high temperature has been well documented. However, studies on the effects of moderately high temperature on Acropora corals are limited. In the summer of 2016, a moderate coral bleaching event due to moderately high temperature was observed around Sesoko Island, Okinawa, Japan. The objective of this study was to examine thermal tolerance patterns of Acropora corals, across reefs with low to moderate thermal exposure (degree heating weeks similar to 2-5 degrees C week). Field surveys on permanent plots were conducted from October 2015 to April 2017 to compare the population dynamics of adult Acropora corals 6 months before and after the bleaching events around Sesoko Island. Variability in thermal stress response was driven primarily by the degree of thermal stress. Wave action and turbidity may have mediated the thermal stress. Tabular and digitate coral morphologies were the most tolerant and susceptible to thermal stress, respectively. Growth inhibition after bleaching was more pronounced in the larger digitate and corymbose coral morphologies. This study indicates that Acropora populations around Sesoko Island can tolerate short-term, moderate thermal challenges.","[Singh, Tanya] Univ Ryukyus, Grad Sch Engn & Sci, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan; [Iijima, Mariko; Yasumoto, Ko] Kitasato Univ, Sch Marine Biosci, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan; [Sakai, Kazuhiko] Univ Ryukyus, Trop Biosphere Res Ctr, Sesoko Stn, Motobu, Okinawa, Japan",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0210795,2019

In the face of predicted large-scale coral degradation over the coming decades, the importance of long-term monitoring of stress-induced ecosystem changes has been widely recognised. In areas where sustained funding is unavailable, citizen science monitoring has the potential to be a powerful alternative to conventional monitoring programmes. In this study we used data collected by volunteers in Southeast Sulawesi (Indonesia), to demonstrate the potential of marine citizen science programmes to provide scientifically sound information necessary for detecting ecosystem changes in areas where no alternative data are available. Data were collected annually between 2002 and 2012 and consisted of percent benthic biotic and abiotic cover and fish counts. Analyses revealed long-term coral reef ecosystem change. We observed a continuous decline of hard coral, which in turn had a significant effect on the associated fishes, at community, family and species levels. We provide evidence of the importance of marine citizen science programmes in detecting long-term ecosystem change as an effective way of delivering conservation data to local government and national agencies. This is particularly true for areas where funding for monitoring is unavailable, resulting in an absence of ecological data. For citizen science data to contribute to ecological monitoring and local decision-making, the data collection protocols need to adhere to sound scientific standards, and protocols for data evaluation need to be available to local stakeholders.

Results showed that in anthropogenically disturbed areas, gobies had shorter latency periods than in undisturbed areas. FID were also significantly shorter.

Therefore, measurements of productivity (primary production, P) for benthic reef organisms and communities are critical to understand reef functioning. Short-term (minutes to hours) P measurements of reef photosynthesizers virtually always produce the classic hyperbolic tangent (or similar) P-E (irradiance) relationship, with P rapidly rising to a saturation point as E increases. Longer- term (days to weeks), larger-scale investigations of natural reef communities typically do not explore P-E relationships, but the few that do show no saturation of time-integrated P with high time-integrated E. In this paper we present a modeling study to reconcile this apparent contradiction. We used 52 published short-term (instantaneous) P-E curves of organisms (corals, algae) and communities (corals, mixed corals and algae) from different reefs in the Indo-Pacific and the Caribbean, each coupled with 928 diel light curves comprising a wide range of cloud cover scenarios. The diel light curves provided instantaneous E at 1-minute intervals, from which we calculated corresponding instantaneous P using the different published P-E relationships. We integrated both variables to calculate time-integrated E and P. Time-integrated E varied up to 18-fold due to changes in cloud cover and season. We found that, despite routine saturation of instantaneous P, day-scale P-E relationships were near linear in all cases, with slightly decreased linearity in cases where instantaneous light saturation occurred very early during the day. This indicates that the Functional Convergence Hypothesis (FCH) developed by terrestrial ecologists may also apply for reef photosynthesizers. The FCH states that despite short-term light saturation, plants on average do not absorb more light than they can use, since resource allocations are strictly coordinated and tailored towards an optimal use. Thus, there is no contradiction: At the growth time scale (>= day), P should be expected to be a near linear function of E. One implication is that reef P can be estimated using rapid optical measurements, as opposed to traditional, laborious respirometry methods. The requirement going forward is to derive appropriate values for light-use efficiency, which is the rate at which the plant or community converts absorbed light into fixed carbon.","[Sawall, Yvonne; Hochberg, Eric J.] Bermuda Inst Ocean Sci, Coral Reef Ecol & Opt Lab, St Georges, Bermuda",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0208607,2018

However, whether the interaction between elevated CO2 and diel CO2 cycles is further modified by elevated temperature is unknown. To test this, we reared juvenile spiny damselfish, Acanthochromis polyacanthus, for 11 weeks in two stable (450 and 1000 mu atm) and two diel- cycling elevated CO(2 )treatments (1000 +/- 300 and 1000 +/- 500 mu atm) at both current-day (29 degrees C) and projected future temperature (31 degrees C). We measured the effects on survivorship, growth, behavioral lateralization, activity, boldness and escape performance (fast starts). A significant interaction between CO2 and temperature was only detected for survivorship. Survival was lower in the two cycling CO2 treatments at 31 degrees C compared with 29 degrees C but did not differ between temperatures in the two stable CO2 treatments. In other traits we observed independent effects of elevated CO2, and interactions between elevated CO2 and diel CO2 cycles, but these effects were not influenced by temperature. There was a trend toward decreased growth in fish reared under stable elevated CO2 that was counteracted by diel CO2 cycles, with fish reared under cycling CO2 being significantly larger than fish reared under stable elevated CO2. Diel CO2 cycles also mediated the negative effect of elevated CO2 on behavioral lateralization, as previously reported. Routine activity was reduced in the 1000 +/- 500 mu atm CO2 treatment compared to control fish. In contrast, neither boldness nor fast-starts were affected by any of the CO2 treatments. Elevated temperature had significant independent effects on growth, routine activity and fast start performance. Our results demonstrate that diel CO2 cycles can significantly modify the growth and behavioral responses of fish under elevated CO2 and that these effects are not altered by elevated temperature, at least in this species. Our findings add to a growing body of work that highlights the critical importance of incorporating natural CO2 variability in ocean acidification experiments to more accurately assess the effects of ocean climate change on marine ecosystems.","[Jarrold, Michael D.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Jarrold, Michael D.; Munday, Philip L.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia",0,10.3389/fmars.2018.00458,2018

The extent to which MCEs and shallow benthic populations are connected, and whether coral sexual reproduction is maintained under the mesophotic environmental conditions, are still unclear. Despite the trend of increasing studies concerning the MCEs, the reproductive traits of MCE Indo-Pacific octocorals have remained uninvestigated to date. The current study engages with two common zooxanthellate octocorals in the northern Red Sea: the internal-brooder Ovabunda spp. and the surface-brooder Rhytisma fulvum fulvum. It addresses the hypothesis that, similar to their shallowzone conspecifics, the upper mesophotic populations also reproduce sexually. We analyze the reproductive traits of tropical, upper mesophotic octocoral populations and compare them for the first time to the traits of their conspecifics on shallow reefs. In addition, we discuss the timing of surface-brooding events in relation to lunar phase and daily seawater temperature. The populations of Ovabunda spp. in the upper MCE and shallow-water display several similar reproductive traits (e.g., maximal gonad diameter and fecundity). Consequently, this species seems to be a successful depthgeneralist. In contrast, the reproductive features of R. f. fulvum differ between the reefs in the upper MCE and in those shallow-water, with a decreased abundance of female colonies, lower fecundity, and a lower percentage of colonies exhibiting surfacebrooding in the former. It thus seems that the R. f. fulvum population encounters certain constraints in the MCE that may, in turn, lead to its reduced reproductive performance there. In addition, surface-brooding events for R. f. fulvum in the uppermesophotic zone and in shallow-water were separated by two weeks. Since a distinctive seawater temperature rise preceded each surface-brooding event, temperature regimes at different depths may present extrinsic cues that influence the timing of reproduction. The findings from this study contribute to our understanding of the life-history of mesophotic benthic inhabitants in general and of octocorals in particular. Overall, the current findings reinforce the viewpoint that the refuge potential of MCEs may be reflective of species-specific reproductive traits.","[Liberman, Ronen; Shlesinger, Tom; Loya, Yossi; Benayahu, Yehuda] Tel Aviv Univ, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, Sch Zool, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Liberman, Ronen] Interuniv Inst Marine Sci Eilat, Elat, Israel",0,10.3389/fmars.2018.00445,2018

Deeper habitats offer some protection from these impacts and may safeguard reef-coral biodiversity, but their faunas are largely undescribed for the Indo-Pacific. Here, we show high species richness of scleractinian corals in mesophotic habitats (30-125 m) for the northern Great Barrier Reef region that greatly exceeds previous records for mesophotic habitats globally. Overall, 45% of shallow-reef species (less than or equal to 30 m), 78% of genera, and all families extended below 30 m depth, with 13% of species, 41% of genera, and 78% of families extending below 45 m. Maximum depth of occurrence showed a weak relationship to phylogeny, but a strong correlation with maximum latitudinal extent. Species recorded in the mesophotic had a significantly greater than expected probability of also occurring in shaded microhabitats and at higher latitudes, consistent with light as a common limiting factor. The findings suggest an important role for deeper habitats, particularly depths 30-45 m, in preserving evolutionary lineages of Indo-Pacific corals.

In this context of rapid change, effective site-based management of coral reef fisheries necessitates flexible environmental governance that is closely attuned to the needs of multiple stakeholders who depend on the fishery for income, food, and cultural identity. As such, many practitioners and scholars call for adaptive co-management of coral reef fisheries where local resource users play a primary role in environmental governance with the support of flexible institutions that operate across organizational scales. This article describes the history and evaluates the current status of marine governance in Moorea, French Polynesia. Established in 2004, the management framework is under revision because it has failed to meet its ecological objectives and has generated discontent among many stakeholders. Drawing on household surveys, interviews, and archival information, the challenges to as well as the factors that may enable a more successful transition of the current governance arrangement towards co-management are detailed. It is argued that recent social mobilization, subsistence and cultural links to the fishery, the presence of geographically and socially relevant traditional governance boundaries, and the implementation of co-management in other parts of French Polynesia are positive factors. However, lack of trust between stakeholders, social heterogeneity, disruption of traditional cultural institutions and practices, minimal institutional support, and an uncertain legal framework suggest that there are significant headwinds for maneuvering towards successful co-management in Moorea.","[Hunter, Chelsea E.; Lauer, Matthew] San Diego State Univ, Dept Anthropol, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Levine, Arielle] San Diego State Univ, Dept Geog, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Holbrook, Sally] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Holbrook, Sally] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Rassweiler, Andrew] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 319 Stadium Dr, Tallahassee, FL 32304 USA",0,10.1016/j.marpol.2018.09.016,2018

To investigate the outbreak densities of the corallivorous gastropod Drupella cornus, we conducted both in situ feeding and coral growth experiments at Mandu reef within the Ningaloo Marine Park, Western Australia. Over two 10-day periods, we tagged and photographed feeding scars on colonies of the tabulate coral Acropora spicifera that harboured Drupella feeding aggregations. We calculated a mean in situ Drupella consumption rate of 1.16 +/- 1.1cm(2) coral area individual(-1)d(-1). We also determined coral growth rates by tagging and photographing 24 colonies of Acropora spicifera at time zero and then again 1year later. We calculated a mean linear extension rate of 7.9 +/- 3.7cmyr(-1) for actively growing Acropora spicifera, which we then used to estimate A. spicifera growth rates over a range of coral cover values. This combination allowed us to determine the maximum number of Drupella that could be sustained across a range of coral cover. Our data suggest that the outbreak density of Drupella at the average level of coral cover for back reef sites at Mandu reef (17.6 +/- 13.7%) is approximately 0.95 individuals m(-2) reef area. At the maximum coral cover observed at Mandu reef (60%), the outbreak density of Drupella is estimated to be approximately 2.83 individuals m(-2) reef area. Establishing Drupella outbreak densities assists managers in predicting possible outbreak abundances and in monitoring coral reef health.","[Bessey, C.; Thomson, D.

Using the newly established protocol, we show that the Halimeda N-15-SOM can be used as a proxy for the N-15 of water column NO3-. Based on aquarium and field measurements we show that the maximum offset between the Halimeda N-15-SOM and the N-15 of water column NO3-, as a result of fractionation during uptake, is 1 parts per thousand. However this was only tested at low NO3- concentrations (<10mol L-1). Our results demonstrate that in low-nutrient environments, Halimeda skeletal material, including historical material obtained from sediment cores, can provide a reliable proxy record of N-15-NO3- at the base of the food web.

Concentrations of dissolved oxygen were replenished from high-current flows advecting water from off the reef. Low current flow conditions (<0.05ms(-1)) coincided with a short-term reduction in oxygen, the extent of which varied seasonally and were observed to be greatest during July and August, coinciding with the summer Calanus proliferation in the Skagerrak. Normalized acoustic backscatter amplitude during the summer months showed a strong signal of zooplankton diurnal vertical migration, coinciding with the lowest oxygen concentrations at the reef observed during, and lagging slightly after, the deep phase of the zooplankton vertical migration.

However, anemonefish community structure has seldom been investigated in high-latitude areas. To understand the mechanism underlying species diversity of anemonefish in the northern limits of their distribution and to compare with previous results from tropical and other areas, we investigated the community structure of anemonefish around the western coast of Okinawa-jima Island, Japan. Seven species of host anemones and six species of anemonefish were distributed across the 12 study sites. The diversity index of anemonefish and the host anemone varied among sites; anemonefish diversity increased with diversity of host anemones, which was associated with the ratio of sandy areas and distance from shore. The density of each species of anemonefish increased with the density of the primary host anemone, which suggests that niche differentiation may be occurring. However, results of two species of host anemone (Stichodactyla mertensii, Heteractis magnifica) associated each with two species of anemonefish did not support the niche differentiation hypothesis. Forty-seven percent of S. mertensii were shared by Amphiprion clarkii and A. sandaracinos simultaneously, supporting the cohabitation hypothesis. Amphiprion ocellaris and A. perideraion used the same host H. magnifica, but never shared a host simultaneously. Moreover, anemone size and water depth did not differ between the two anemonefish species, suggesting the possibility of the lottery model. In subtropical Okinawa, 86.7% of species interactions supported the niche differentiation hypothesis, 6.7% supported the cohabitation hypothesis, and 6.7% supported the lottery hypothesis.

However, most studies examining the capacity for herbivores to consume fleshy macroalgae (e.g., Sargassum) have investigated removal of the leafy' biomass without considering the susceptibility of other components of the macroalga, in particular the holdfast, to herbivory. Here, we investigate the susceptibility of Sargassum components (blades, stipes and holdfasts) to herbivory and investigate the capacity for Sargassum to regrow following damage to the holdfast. We placed entire thalli of Sargassum swartzii on the reef crest at Lizard Island, northern Great Barrier Reef, for 24d, and used photographs and video recordings to quantify rates of removal over this period. The blades of the S. swartzii were rapidly removed (100% in 2 d), whereas the stipes were less susceptible to herbivores, with 72% of experimental thalli having partial stipes remaining after 24d. Only one holdfast (out of 54) was removed during the experiment, while all of the remaining holdfasts were largely undamaged. When S. swartzii holdfasts were experimentally damaged, we found no detectable effect on thallus height or holdfast size among regrown thalli after 1 y. There was, however, a 50% reduction in survival for S. swartzii individuals when 75% of the holdfast was removed. This study shows that holdfasts of S. swartzii are extremely resistant to herbivory, and that incidental bites on S. swartzii holdfasts are unlikely to affect their growth or survival unless three-quarters of the holdfast is removed. The capacity of Sargassum to regenerate from damaged holdfasts, coupled with the low rate of herbivory on holdfasts, suggests that sustained browsing (preventing regrowth of the stipe and blades) may be more important in reversing macroalgae dominance than physical removal of holdfasts by herbivorous fishes.","[Loffler, Zoe; Graba-Landry, Alexia; McClure, Eva C.; Pratchett, Morgan S.; Hoey, Andrew S.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Kidgell, Joel T.] James Cook Univ, MACRO Ctr Macroalgal Resources & Biotechnol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [McClure, Eva C.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",0,10.1007/s00338-018-01745-w,2018

Here, we combine underwater images, visual censuses and remote sensing data for 1566 sites across 34 islands spanning the central-western Pacific Ocean, to empirically assess the relative roles of abiotic and grazing processes in determining the prevalence of calcifying organisms and fleshy algae on coral reefs. We used regression trees to identify the major predictors of benthic composition and to test whether anthropogenic stress at inhabited islands decouples natural relationships. We show that sea surface temperature, wave energy, oceanic productivity and aragonite saturation strongly influence benthic community composition; overlooking these factors may bias expectations of calcified reef states. Maintenance of grazing biomass above a relatively low threshold (10-20kgha(-1)) may also prevent transitions to algal-dominated states, providing a tangible management target for rebuilding overexploited herbivore populations. Biophysical relationships did not decouple at inhabited islands, indicating that abiotic influences remain important macroscale processes, even at chronically disturbed reefs. However, spatial autocorrelation among inhabited reefs was substantial and exceeded abiotic and grazing influences, suggesting that natural constraints on reef benthos were superseded by unmeasured anthropogenic impacts. Evidence of strong abiotic influences on reef benthic communities underscores their importance in specifying quantitative targets for coral reef management and restoration that are realistic within the context of local conditions.","[Robinson, James P.

To investigate genetic connectivity of the depth-generalist coral species Montastraea cavernosa, populations from both shallow (15-30m) and mesophotic coral ecosystems (30-70m) in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) were analyzed with microsatellite genotyping. A series of upstream and downstream sites were chosen in marine protected areas including Carrie Bow Cay, Belize; Flower Garden Banks and nearby mesophotic bank habitats; Pulley Ridge; and Dry Tortugas. Patterns of genetic diversity within the northwest GOM supported relatively open coral populations with high levels of gene flow between shallow and mesophotic depth zones, consistent with strong oceanographic patterns and hypothesized availability of coral reef habitats in the GOM. Conversely, genetic differentiation within Belize and the southeast GOM indicate relative isolation of shallow and mesophotic M. cavernosa populations in these regions. Structure analysis showed dominant genetic clusters within each region that did not correlate strongly with depth zones, and identified a cluster of unknown origin contributing to high differentiation at Pulley Ridge. Migration modeling predicted historical region-wide panmixia for most regions, with Pulley Ridge appearing to be a potential sink population. The GOM appears to demonstrate stronger evidence of vertical connectivity compared to elsewhere in the Tropical Western Atlantic, which may be the result of oceanographic variability and/or lack of local selection at depth. These findings are consistent with previous studies identifying genetic connectivity of broadcast-spawning corals across broad spatial scales and highlight the potential importance of mesophotic habitats in the GOM as larval sources to geographically distant populations.","[Studivan, M.

We examined the full breadth of the life history, including pelagic larval duration, growth patterns throughout the ontogeny (post-settlement, juvenile, and adult), life span, mortality, age at maturity, and reproductive timing, as well as the size-dependent relative contribution of females to overall reproductive effort. The age-based demographic information supports a sexual pattern of functional gonochorism, whereby sex ratios were consistent throughout the lifespan. After a 25-day pelagic larval duration, the species growth pattern is comparatively slow and differs by sex, where males generally reach larger sizes at a given age than females. This growth pattern is associated with a long life span (at least 30yrs) and low mortality rates (<0.2yr(-1)). Annual and lunar tracking of ovary weights confirmed cyclical spawning activity synchronized just prior to new moon throughout the year. Surprisingly, ovary weights declined in the largest and oldest females, implying lower reproductive output. Instead, lower ovary weights may reflect alternative mating strategies among the largest females whereby spawning frequency and strategy differs among females of different body sizes. These results highlight several novel and previously unknown aspects of this species' biology, and our analyses generate information that can strengthen population models, facilitate stock assessments, support regional management, and provide a baseline for comparative work.","[Taylor, Brett M.] Pacific Otolith Serv, Honolulu, HI 96701 USA; [Hamilton, Richard J.] Asia Pacific Resource Ctr, Nat Conservancy, 48 Montague Rd, South Brisbane, Qld 4101, Australia; [Hamilton, Richard J.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Almany, Glenn R.] UPVD, EPHE, CNRS, CRIOBE,USR 3278, 58 Ave Paul Alduy, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Almany, Glenn R.] Lab Excellence CORAIL, 58 Ave Paul Alduy, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Choat, J.

The fourth wave of Acanthaster cf. solaris outbreaks since the 1960s started around 2010 on Australia's Great Barrier Reef. Ecological monitoring failed to detect early outbreak stages, thus preventing timely intervention. Here, we develop a digital droplet PCR (ddPCR)-based method to detect environmental DNA (eDNA) of CoTS in 2-l water samples that can be compared with abundances of the species recorded by divers along 200-m(2) transects. Aquarium tests demonstrated that eDNA was readily detectable and increases proportional to the biomass of CoTS (R-2=0.99, p<0.0001). Adaptation from a quantitative PCR technique developed for CoTS larvae (Doyle et al. in Marine Biology 164:176, 2017) to ddPCR improved the limit of quantification (LOQ) by a factor of 45. During field verification on 11 reefs, CoTS eDNA was detectable on all reefs suffering outbreaks. In contrast, CoTS eDNA was absent from post-outbreak' reefs after populations collapsed and from pre-outbreak' reefs. In linear models, CoTS densities explained a high amount of variance of eDNA concentrations, both for water samples taken at the depth of transects (R-2=0.60, p<0.0001) and on the sea surface (R-2=0.46, p=0.0004). The proportion of samples above LOQ was also correlated with CoTS densities, with a similar amount of variance explained as for the concentration (underwater R-2=0.68, p<0.0001; surface R-2=0.49, p=0.0004). We conclude that, after consideration of sampling locations and times, this method is promising for CoTS population monitoring and early detection of outbreaks and might supplement or replace traditional monitoring. Development of automated samplers and possibly on board PCR in the future will further improve early detection.","[Uthicke, Sven; Doyle, Jason R.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, PMB 3, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Lamare, Miles] Univ Otago, Dept Marine Sci, Dunedin 9016, New Zealand",0,10.1007/s00338-018-1734-6,2018

Putative neural circuits responsible for these tasks have been isolated in laboratory studies. However, it is unclear whether and how these circuits combine to generate the flexible, dynamic sequences of evasion behavior exhibited by wild, freely moving animals. Here, we report that evasion behavior of wild fish on a coral reef is generated through a sequence of well-defined decision rules that convert visual sensory input into behavioral actions. Using an automated system to present visual threat stimuli to fish in situ, we show that individuals initiate escape maneuvers in response to the perceived size and expansion rate of an oncoming threat using a decision rule that matches dynamics of known loom-sensitive neural circuits. After initiating an evasion maneuver, fish adjust their trajectories using a control rule based on visual feedback to steer away from the threat and toward shelter. These decision rules accurately describe evasion behavior of fish from phylogenetically distant families, illustrating the conserved nature of escape decision-making. Our results reveal how the flexible behavioral responses required for survival can emerge from relatively simple, conserved decision-making mechanisms.","[Hein, Andrew M.; Gil, Michael A.] NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Hein, Andrew M.; Gil, Michael A.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Gil, Michael A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Twomey, Colin R.] Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Couzin, Iain D.] Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, D-78457 Constance, Germany; [Couzin, Iain D.] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Collect Behav, D-78464 Constance, Germany; [Couzin, Iain D.] Univ Konstanz, Chair Biodivers & Collect Behav, D-78457 Constance, Germany; [Levin, Simon A.] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Levin, Simon A.] Princeton Univ, Princeton Environm Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",0,10.1073/pnas.1809140115,2018

This study used baited remote underwater stereo-video systems (stereo-BRUVs) to compare species richness, fish abundance and size along 42.3 km of subsea pipeline and in adjacent areas of varying habitats. The pipeline is laid in an onshore-offshore direction enabling surveys to encompass a range of depths from 9 m nearshore out to 140 m depth offshore. Surveys off the pipeline were performed across this depth range and in an array of natural habitats (sand, macroalgae, coral reef) between 1 km and 40 km distance from the pipeline. A total of 14,953 fish were observed comprising 240 species (131 on the pipeline and 225 off-pipeline) and 59 families (39 on the pipeline and 56 off-pipeline) and the length of 8,610 fish were measured. The fish assemblage on and off the pipeline was similar in depths of <80 m. In depths beyond 80 m, the predominant habitat off-pipeline was sand and differences between fish assemblages on and off-pipeline were more pronounced. The pipeline was characterised by higher biomass and abundances of larger-bodied, commercially important species such as: Pristipomoides multidens (goldband snapper), Lutjanus malabaricus (saddletail snapper) and Lutjanus russellii (Moses' snapper) among others, and possessed a catch value 2-3 times higher per stereo-BRUV deployment than that of fish observed off-pipeline. Adjacent natural seabed habitats possessed higher abundances of Atule mate (yellowtail scad), Nemipterus spp. (threadfin bream) and Terapon jarbua (crescent grunter), species of no or low commercial value. This is the first published study to use stereo-BRUVs to report on the importance of subsea infrastructure to commercially important fishes over a depth gradient and increases our knowledge of the fish assemblage associated with subsea infrastructure off north-west Australia. These results provide a greater understanding of ecological and fisheries implications of decommissioning subsea infrastructure on the north-west shelf, and will help better inform decision-making on the fate of infrastructure at different depths.","[Bond, Todd; Partridge, Julian C.; Taylor, Michael D.; Cooper, Tim F.; McLean, Dianne L.] Univ Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Bond, Todd; Partridge, Julian C.; Taylor, Michael D.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Cooper, Tim F.] BHP, Perth, WA, Australia; [McLean, Dianne L.] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Grad Sch, Crawley, WA, Australia",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0207703,2018

To identify management scenarios that will reverse or mitigate ecosystem degradation, managers can benefit from tools that can quantify projected changes in ecosystem services due to alternative management options. We used a spatially-explicit biophysical ecosystem model to evaluate socio-ecological trade-offs of land-based vs. marine-based management scenarios, and local-scale vs. global-scale stressors and their cumulative impacts. To increase the relevance of understanding ecological change for the public and decision-makers, we used four ecological production functions to translate the model outputs into the ecosystem services: ""State of the Reef,"" ""Trophic Integrity,"" ""Fisheries Production,"" and ""Fisheries Landings."" For a case study of Maui Nui, Hawaii, land-based management attenuated coral cover decline whereas fisheries management promoted higher total fish biomass. Placement of no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) across 30% of coral reef areas led to a reversal of the historical decline in predatory fish biomass, although this outcome depended on the spatial arrangement of MPAs. Coral cover declined less severely under strict sediment mitigation scenarios. However, the benefits of these local management scenarios were largely lost when accounting for climate-related impacts. Climate-related stressors indirectly increased herbivore biomass due to the shift from corals to algae and, hence, greater food availability. The two ecosystem services related to fish biomass increased under climate-related stressors but ""Trophic Integrity"" of the reef declined, indicating a less resilient reef. ""State of the Reef"" improved most and ""Trophic Integrity"" declined least under an optimistic global warming scenario and strict local management. This work provides insight into the relative influence of land-based vs. marine-based management and local vs. global stressors as drivers of changes in ecosystem dynamics while quantifying the tradeoffs between conservation- and extraction-oriented ecosystem services.","[Weijerman, Mariska; Lecky, Joey; Oleson, Kirsten L.

Most studies of coral reef dynamics have focused on clear-water systems though corals inhabit many turbid regions. Here, we illustrate the key drivers of an inshore coral reef ecosystem using 10 years of biological, environmental, and disturbance data. Tropical cyclones, crown-of-thorns starfish, and coral bleaching are recognized as the major drivers of coral loss at mid-and offshore reefs along the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). In comparison, little is known about what drives temporal trends at inshore reefs closer to major anthropogenic stress. We assessed coral cover dynamics using state-space models within six major inshore GBR catchments. An overall decline was detected in nearly half (46%) of the 15 reefs at two depths (30 sites), while the rest exhibited fluctuating (23%), static (17%), or positive (13%) trends. Inshore reefs responded similarly to their offshore counterparts, where contemporary trends were predominantly influenced by acute disturbance events. Storms emerged as the major driver affecting the inshore GBR, with the effects of other drivers such as disease, juvenile coral density, and macroalgal and turf per cent cover varying from one catchment to another. Flooding was also associated with negative trends in live coral cover in two southern catchments, but the mechanism remains unclear as it is not reflected in available metrics of water quality and may act through indirect pathways.","[Lam, Vivian Y.

Marginal habitats may represent important refuges if individuals can acquire adequate resources to survive and reproduce. However, resources at range margins are often distributed more sparsely; therefore, increased effort to acquire resources can result in suboptimal performance and lead to marginal populations becoming non-self-sustaining sink-populations. Shifting resource availability is likely to be particularly problematic for dietary specialists. Here, we use extensive in situ behavioural observations and physiological condition measurements to examine the costs and benefits of resource-acquisition along a depth gradient in two obligate corallivore reef fishes with contrasting levels of dietary specialization. As expected, the space used to secure coral resources increased towards the lower depth margin. However, increased territory sizes resulted in equal or greater availability of resources within deeper territories. In addition, we observed decreased competition and no differences in foraging distance, pairing behaviour, body condition or fecundity at greater depths. Contrary to expectation, our results demonstrate that coral-obligate fishes can select high-quality coral patches on the deeper-reef to access equal or greater resources than their shallow-water counterparts, with no extra costs. This suggests depth offers a viable potential refuge for some at-risk coral-specialist fishes.","[MacDonald, Chancey; Jones, Geoffrey P.] James Cook Univ, Marine Biol & Aquaculture Sci, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [MacDonald, Chancey; Jones, Geoffrey P.; Bridge, Tom] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Bridge, Tom] Queensland Museum Network, Biodivers & Geosci Program, Museum Trop Queensland, 70-102 Flinders St, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia",0,10.1098/rspb.2018.1545,2018

We use Modern Portfolio Theory to identify coral reef locations globally that, in the absence of other impacts, are likely to have a heightened chance of surviving projected climate changes relative to other reefs. Long-term planning that is robust to uncertainty in future conditions provides an objective and transparent framework for guiding conservation action and strategic investment.

Both Sparisoma axillare (Labridae, Scarinae) and Acanthurus chirurgus (Acanthuridae) had a diet composed mainly of detritus, with contributions of red algae. However, the diet of S. axillare displayed higher %N and a lower C:N ratio, although animal material made only a slightly greater contribution to total nitrogen intake than in A. chirurgus. Kyphosus sectatrix (Kyphosidae) ingested mainly carbon-rich corticated algae, while Diplodus argenteus (Sparidae) had a varied, omnivorous diet. These results indicate that conventional diet analysis may not reveal important interspecific differences in nutrient intake and that a reassessment of the nutrient intake of different herbivorous fishes is required to fully understand their ecology. This finding highlights the fact that foods of nominally herbivorous fishes vary greatly in nutritional quality.

Given their generalist habitat affinities and diet, and strong ecological overlap with members of the commercially valuable snapper-grouper complex, increased density and abundance of lionfish could result in significant competitive interactions with nGOM commercially important species. We experimentally investigated the intensity of behavioral interactions between lionfish and indigenous, abundant and economically important juvenile nGOM red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus), and other increasingly abundant juvenile tropical snapper species (gray snapper-L. griseus and lane snapper-L. synagris) in large outdoor mesocosms to examine snapper vulnerabilities to lionfish competition. When paired with lionfish, red snapper swimming activity (i.e., time swimming and roving around experimental tank or at structure habitat during experiments) was significantly lower than in intraspecific control trials, but gray and lane snapper swimming activities in the presence of lionfish did not significantly differ from their intraspecific controls. Additionally in paired trials, red and lane snapper swimming activities were significantly lower than those of lionfish, while no significant difference in swimming activities was observed between lionfish and gray snapper. We found that red snapper prey consumption rates in the presence of lionfish were significantly lower than in their intraspecific 3-individual control trials, but when paired together no significant differences in prey consumption rates between red snapper and lionfish were observed. When paired with lane or gray snapper, lionfish were observed having comparatively higher prey consumption than snappers, or as observed in lionfish intraspecific 1-individual controls. However, lane and gray snapper consumption rates in the presence of lionfish did not significantly differ from those in intraspecific controls. These findings suggest that competition between juvenile snappers and invasive lionfish may be variable, with lionfish exhibiting differing degrees of competitive dominance and snappers exhibiting partial competitive vulnerability and resistance to lionfish. While the degree of intensity at which these interactions may occur in nGOM reefs may differ from those observed in our findings, this study enables greater understanding of the potential ecological effects of red lionfish on native reef fishes.","[Marshak, Anthony R.; Heck, Kenneth L., Jr.] Univ S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, Mobile, AL 36688 USA; [Marshak, Anthony R.; Heck, Kenneth L., Jr.] Dauph Isl Sea Lab, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USA; [Jud, Zachary R.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Marine Sci Program, North Miami, FL USA; [Marshak, Anthony R.] NOAA, ECS Fed LLC, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Off Sci & Technol, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA; [Jud, Zachary R.] Florida Oceanog Soc, Stuart, FL USA",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0206749,2018

Epaulette sharks (Hemiscyllium ocellatum), predominantly found on reef flats, may have evolved behavioural and/or physiological strategies to mitigate the effects of these dramatic temperature fluctuations. Here, juvenile sharks were acclimated, for at least 6 weeks, to average summer temperatures (28 degrees C) or predicted end-of-century summer temperatures (32 degrees C) to investigate the effects of elevated temperatures on growth, survival, and the use of movement to thermoregulate. In addition, sharks experience seasonal temperature changes; therefore, the upper critical thermal limits were determined for adult, wild sharks during both summer and winter months. We found that regardless of acclimation temperature, juveniles maintained the same food consumption rates (similar to 5% body mass every other day), but for those living at 32 degrees C, this resulted in significantly decreased growth rates (body mass and total length). During winter months, maximum habitat temperatures (similar to 24 degrees C) are far below adult sharks' critical thermal limits (35.92 +/- 0.21 degrees C). During summer months, maximum habitat temperatures (similar to 35 degrees C) are closer to adult critical thermal limits (38.85 +/- 0.31 degrees C). When estimating thermoregulatory behaviour of juvenile sharks maintained at 28 degrees C, those sharks examined in winter exhibited no thermoregulatory behaviour, while those examined in summer actively sought to control their thermal exposure, preferring 30.7 +/- 1.04 degrees C (day) and 28.54 +/- 0.75 degrees C (night). Furthermore, after acclimation to predicted end-of-century conditions, these same sharks behaviourally sought out 32.94 +/- 0.46 degrees C (day) and 30.74 +/- 0.68 degrees C (night); despite the cost of decreased growth and/or survival. Sharks maintained in control conditions had a mortality rate of 33% during the initial 90-day period of exposure, while mortality was 100% in those sharks exposed to elevated conditions. Ultimately, as ocean temperatures continue to rise, the distribution and abundance patterns for epaulette sharks and many other coral reef species are likely to change if trade-offs associated with acclimation outweigh the benefits of moving to more favourable habitats.","[Gervais, Connor R.; Nay, Tiffany J.; Rummer, Jodie L.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Gervais, Connor R.; Nay, Tiffany J.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Gervais, Connor R.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Renshaw, Gillian] Griffith Univ, Sch Allied Hlth Sci, Gold Coast Campus, Brisbane, Qld 4222, Australia; [Johansen, Jacob L.] New York Univ Abu Dhabi, Dept Biol, POB 129188, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Steffensen, John F.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Marine Biol Sect, Strandpromenaden 5, DK-3000 Helsingor, Denmark",0,10.1007/s00227-018-3427-7,2018

Variations in survival rates of corals during this period play a key role in structuring adult coral populations. Many coral reefs have experienced reductions in herbivory rates due to overfishing and consequent increases in macroalgae, however, the effect of increased coral-algal interactions may vary between coral life-history stages and among locations. Therefore understanding the relative importance of different drivers of mortality across early life-history stages, under a range of environmental conditions, is essential to effectively manage and restore coral reefs. To date, however, relatively few studies have (a) examined coralalgal interactions across several early life-history stages (i.e., from planulae to juvenile colonies) and (b) done so in highly disturbed reefs close to large urban centers. We investigated the effect of algal-coral-herbivore interactions on early life history stages in the coral Pocillopora acute on coral reefs off mainland Singapore, a heavily disturbed ""urbanized reef environment"". Larval settlement rates were estimated in the presence of six macroalgal species ex situ. The effect of direct interaction with two macroalgal species on newly settled spat was examined in situ and the effect of reduced herbivory was tested with exclusion cages on naturally settled 9-month-old juveniles in situ. We found significant reductions in P. acuta settlement in the presence of four macroalgal species. Newly settled spat of P. acute had significantly lower survivorship when in contact with Sargassum sp. on the reef crest but not with Bryopsis sp. on the reef flat. Herbivore exclusion reduced survivorship of juvenile corals, which was associated with increased sediment accumulation, but not with algal biomass. Our results suggest coral recruitment on heavily disturbed reefs can be impacted by species-specific macroalgal effects via reduced settlement on ephemeral substrata and reduced survivorship when in direct contact with Sargassum sp. Furthermore, recruitment may be negatively impacted by reductions in herbivory, possibly via increased abundance of epilithic algal matrix leading to sediment trapping.","[Leong, Rick C.; Marzinelli, Ezequiel M.; Steinberg, Peter D.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Ctr Marine Bioinnovat, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Marzinelli, Ezequiel M.; Steinberg, Peter D.] Sydney Inst Marine Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Marzinelli, Ezequiel M.; Lim, Elton W.

The resultant soundscapes correlate with benthic macroalgal cover across shallow Hawaiian coral reefs during the day, despite the presence of other biological noise. Likely ubiquitous but previously overlooked, this source of ambient biological noise in the coastal ocean is driven by local supersaturation of oxygen near the surface of macroalgal filaments, and the resultant formation and release of oxygen-containing bubbles into the water column. During release, relaxation of the bubble to a spherical shape creates a monopole sound source that 'rings' at the Minnaert frequency. Many such bubbles create a large, distributed sound source over the sea floor. Reef soundscapes contain vast quantities of biological information, making passive acoustic ecosystem evaluation a tantalizing prospect if the sources are known. Our observations introduce the possibility of a general, volumetrically integrative, noninvasive, rapid and remote technique for evaluating algal abundance and rates of primary productivity in littoral aquatic communities. Increased algal cover is one of the strongest indicators for coral reef ecosystem stress. Visually determining variations in algal abundance is a time-consuming and expensive process. This technique could therefore provide a valuable tool for ecosystem management but also for industrial monitoring of primary production, such as in algae-based biofuel synthesis.","[Freeman, Simon E.; Freeman, Lauren A.] Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr, Newport, RI 02841 USA; [Freeman, Simon E.] US Naval Res Lab, Underwater Acoust & Signal Proc Div, Washington, DC 20375 USA; [Giorli, Giacomo] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Wellington, New Zealand; [Haas, Andreas F.] NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Marine Microbiol & Biogeochem, Texel, Netherlands; [Haas, Andreas F.] Univ Utrecht, Texel, Netherlands",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0201766,2018

In an effort to improve our understanding of the life history characters that facilitated this unprecedented invasion, we performed a mark-release-recapture study with 36 tagged individuals to document life history characteristics of the Red Sea lionfish, Pterois miles, in its native habitat. Monthly growth rates of juveniles ranged from 4.0 to 10.8mmmonth(-1) independent of water temperature. Highest juvenile growth rates (>9.0mmmonth(-1)) occurred between May and August when water temperature increased from 22.5 to 28.0 degrees C, while growth rates dropped sharply between August and September when water temperature was consistently high. Adult lionfish had relatively constant growth rates of 4-6mmmonth(-1). Despite high site fidelity of some individuals, recapture success gradually declined from 83 to 3% during the 15-month study period. Thus, the consistent population density of 95 fish ha(-1) likely reflected a well-balanced exchange of individuals with adjacent reef habitats. To identify biotic constraints that may limit native lionfish populations, interactions with seven potential predatory and/or competitive grouper species were also investigated. Significantly, fewer lionfish were encountered in micro-habitats, where the Red Sea groupers Aethaloperca rogaa and Cephalopholis miniata resided. In addition, the presence of large groupers (>250mm TL) was significantly correlated with reduced numbers of lionfish, while small groupers (250mm TL) appeared to have no impact. Our field observations suggest that the biotic interactions (e.g., habitat competition, and depredation) between grouper species and lionfish may play a role in lionfish distribution. This study provides new insights into the growth and ecology of lionfish in their native habitats to help illuminate links to their documented success in the invaded range.","[Bos, Arthur R.] Amer Univ Cairo, Dept Biol, New Cairo 11835, Egypt; [Bos, Arthur R.; Sanad, Ashraf M.] Amer Univ Cairo, John D Gerhart Field Stn, El Gouna, Egypt; [Bos, Arthur R.] Nat Biodivers Ctr, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Grubich, Justin R.] Field Museum Nat Hist, Chicago, IL 66005 USA; [Sanad, Ashraf M.] Scuba House Red Sea, Hurghada, Egypt",0,10.1007/s00227-018-3436-6,2018

However, abiotic factors such as the complexity and orientation of the benthos often mediate the impact of herbivores on benthic communities. We experimentally evaluated the independent and interactive effects of substrate orientation and herbivorous fishes on algal community dynamics on a coral reef in the Florida Keys, USA. We created horizontal and vertical substrates, mimicking the trend in the reduction of vertical surfaces of coral reefs, to assess how algal communities developed either with herbivory (open areas) or without herbivory (herbivore exclosures). We found that substrate orientation was the dominant influence on macroalgal community composition. Herbivores had little impact on community development of vertical substrates as crustose algae dominated these substrates regardless of being in exclosures or open areas. In contrast, herbivores strongly impacted communities on horizontal substrates, with upright macroalgae (e.g., Dictyota spp., articulated coralline algae) dominating herbivore exclosures, while filamentous turf algae and sediment dominated open areas. Outside of exclosures, differences between vertical and horizontal substrates exposed to herbivores persisted despite similar intensity of herbivory. Our results suggest that the orientation of the reef benthos has an important impact on benthic communities. On vertical surfaces, abiotic factors may be more important for structuring algal communities while herbivory may be more important for controlling algal dynamics in flatter areas. Thus, the decline in structural complexity of Caribbean coral reefs and the flattening of reef substrates may fundamentally alter the impact that herbivores have on benthic community dynamics.","[Duran, Alain; Collado-Vides, L.; Palma, L.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 11200 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Collado-Vides, L.] Inst Water & Environm, Ctr Coastal Oceans Res, 11200 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Burkepile, D.

In coastal marine ecosystems, small schooling fishes have a large influence on food web dynamics and structure, but despite their importance, the trophic niches of many of these fishes are either completely unknown or only preliminarily described. We assembled a diet dataset for 12 species of small, coastal Indo-Pacific clupeoids (herrings, sardines, and anchovies) containing measurements of 12,401 prey items from 619 individual fish predators to address four objectives: (1) assign species to trophic guilds based upon prey-type and -size consumption, (2) identify ontogenetic shifts in prey-type and -size consumption, (3) test the hypotheses that niche breadth, measured as the range of prey sizes consumed, and relative niche breadth (ratio of niche breadth to predator size) are positively correlated with predator size, and (4) test the hypotheses that maximum prey-size consumption and relative maximum prey-size consumption (ratio of maximum prey size to predator size) are positively correlated with predator size. We identified three and five trophic guilds based upon prey types and prey sizes, respectively. Diets changed through ontogeny in nearly every species. Linear regression revealed positive correlations between niche breadth, maximum prey width, and relative maximum prey width and predator size, but did not find a statistically significant correlation between relative niche breadth and predator size. This study shows that measuring prey size in addition to prey type can offer additional, higher resolution information about fish trophic ecology.

Here, we compared the response to simulated summer heatwave temperatures (+1.5 and +3.0 degrees C above average) in two populations of a coral reef damselfish with different capacities for thermal plasticity. We found that the more thermally tolerant population had greater plasticity of gene expression and had significantly more downregulated genes, which may provide more energy to repair damage associated with thermal stress and to maintain basic functions at these extreme temperatures. In contrast, the thermally sensitive population exhibited higher basal levels of heat shock proteins and had three times fewer changes in gene expression overall. The limited changes in gene regulation suggest that individuals have reduced genome plasticity to tolerate thermal fluctuations and consequently may not have enough energy to repair damage and resume cellular homeostasis at extreme temperatures. Thus, we have identified the molecular signatures of how two genetically distinct fish populations cope with an extreme thermal event, and why they differ in their capacity for thermal plasticity.","[Veilleux, Heather D.; Donelson, Jennifer M.; Munday, Philip L.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excelienoe Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Ryu, Taewoo] APEC Climate Ctr, Busan, South Korea; [Ravasi, Timothy] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Div Biol & Environm Sci & Engn, KAUST Environm Epigenet Program, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia",0,10.3389/fmars.2018.00349,2018

Assuming the size-dependency of patch departure behaviour, model-based approaches have shown size-mediated coexistence in systems of competing species. However, experimental evidence for the influence of body size on patch use behaviour is scarce. In this study, we explore whether allometric principles provide an underlying framework for interspecific patterns of resource use. To this end, we propose a meso-cosm approach using three species of gastropods differing in size as a model system and P-32 radio-isotopic techniques as a measure of resource use. Foragers of different size were placed in an artificial patch, provided with a limited amount of labelled resource and let them free to move as resources decrease and scarcity is sensed. We investigated the extent to which individual body size affects the exploitation of resources by examining Giving Up Density (GUD), Giving Up Time (GUT), resource absorption rate and exploitation efficiency as components of individual exploitation behaviour. To compare positive, constant and negative individual size scaling of population energy requirements, experimental trials with an equal numbers and equal biomass of differently sized foragers were carried out, and an experimental trial with equal metabolic requirements was simulated. We observed clear size dependency in the patch departure behaviour of the experimental organisms. Even under conditions of equivalent overall population energy requirements, larger foragers decided to leave the resource patch earlier and at a higher density of resources than smaller ones. Smaller foragers were able to prolong their presence and make more use of the resources, resulting in an inverse body-size scaling of resource exploitation efficiency.","[Cozzoli, Francesco; Ligetta, Giovanna; Vignes, Fabio; Basset, Alberto] Univ Salento, Dept Biol & Environm Sci & Technol, Lab Ecol, Lecce, Italy",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0204448,2018

Currently coral reefs are part of the vulnerable ecosystems which are most threatened by human activities and climate change. Responding to these pressures demands decisions at multiple scales, based on solid knowledge of coral reefs but also on strengthened awareness to build adaptive management solutions. Here we evaluate the impact of an environmental awareness campaign for children using a teaching toolbox developed by scientists (MARECO ""The Coral Reef In Our Hands""). To assess this impact before and after using the toolbox, we analyzed the evolution of children's representations of coral reefs through drawings. This study was carried out in New Caledonia, focusing on five elementary schools in different social and cultural contexts (urban, rural and coastal). Two hundred and forty-eight drawings were made by children. The drawings were analyzed quantitatively using multivariate statistical analyses which reveals a diversity of representations in children with diverse sociocultural profiles, but also between schools, emphasizing that relationships with nature and marine environment vary according to direct and indirect experiences related to reefs. Furthermore, our results pointed out relevant differences in coral reef representations before and after the use of MARECO, particularly regarding their knowledge of reef biodiversity associated with multicolored organisms and the connection of coral reef with environment, the number of colors being used as a proxy of this holistic vision developed by children. These results point out the performance of MARECO as a playful tool to transfer scientific knowledge to children. Coral reef conservation is intimately linked to an awareness in young generations of the environmental challenges of tomorrow.

While several mechanisms may lead to alternate stable states on coral reefs, only a few have been investigated theoretically. We explore a model that illustrates that reduced vulnerability of macroalgae to herbivory as macroalgae grow and mature could be an important mechanism: when macroalgae are palatable to herbivores as juveniles, but resistant as adults, coral-dominated and algae-dominated states are bistable across a wide range of parameter space. We compare two approaches to global sensitivity analysis to rank the relative importance of the model parameters in determining the presence and magnitude of alternative stable states, and find that the two most influential parameters are the death rate of coral and the rate of maturation of algae out of the vulnerable stage. The Random Forest approach for global sensitivity analysis, recently adopted by ecologists, provides a more efficient method for ranking the relative importance of parameters than a variance-based approach that has been used frequently by computer scientists and engineers. Our results suggest that managing reefs to reduce chronic stressors that cause coral mortality and/or enhance the growth rates of algae can help prevent reefs from becoming locked in a macroalgae-dominated state.","[Briggs, Cheryl J.; Holbrook, Sally J.; Schmitt, Russell J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Adam, Thomas C.; Holbrook, Sally J.; Schmitt, Russell J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Marine Sci Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0202273,2018

In late 2014, a white syndrome disease outbreak was reported off the coast of southeast Florida and was subsequently documented spreading throughout the region. This study examined the regional impacts of the disease event on the southeast Florida stony coral population utilizing stony coral demographic data from the Southeast Florida Coral Reef Evaluation and Monitoring Project (SECREMP). SECREMP is a long-term monitoring project examining 22 sites distributed from Miami-Dade County north to Martin County, Florida. The results revealed significant region-wide declines in stony coral diversity, density, and live tissue area corresponding with increased disease prevalence, which reached its maximum for the study period in 2016. Regional declines in coral density approached 30% loss and live tissue was upward of 60% as a result of the disease outbreak. Additionally, multiple species were severely impacted, especially the reef building, complexity-contributing species Montastraea cavernosa, Meandrina meandrites, and Siderastrea siderea. The disease outbreak resulted in acute mortality and altered the ecosystem function to a point such that recovery is uncertain.

Bioerosion (i.e. biodegradation of substrate) and encrustation (i.e. calcified overgrowth on substrate) influence the carbonate budget and the ecological functions of coral reefs, by substrate formation/consolidation/erosion, food availability and nutrient cycling. This study investigates settlement succession and carbonate budget change by bioeroding and encrusting calcifying organisms on experimentally deployed coral substrates (skeletal fragments of Stylophora pistillate branches). The substrates were deployed in a marginal coral reef located in the Gulf of Papagayo (Costa Rica, Eastern Tropical Pacific) for four months during the northern winter upwelling period (December 2013 to March 2014), and consecutively sampled after each month. Due to the upwelling environmental conditions within the Eastern Tropical Pacific, this region serves as a natural laboratory to study ecological processes such as bioerosion, which may reflect climate change scenarios. Time-series analyses showed a rapid settlement of bioeroders, particularly of lithophagine bivalves of the genus Lithophaga/Leiosolenus (Dillwyn, 1817), within the first two months of exposure. The observed enhanced calcium carbonate loss of coral substrate (>30%) may influence seawater carbon chemistry. This is evident by measurements of an elevated seawater pH (>8.2) and aragonite saturation state (Omega(a)(rag) >3) at Matapalo Reef during the upwelling period, when compared to a previous upwelling event observed at a nearby site in distance to a coral reef (Marina Papagayo). Due to the resulting local carbonate buffer effect of the seawater, an influx of atmospheric CO2 into reef waters was observed. Substrates showed no secondary cements in thin-section analyses, despite constant seawater carbonate oversaturation (Omega(arag) >2.8) during the field experiment. Micro Computerized Tomography (mu CT) scans and microcast-embeddings of the substrates revealed that the carbonate loss was primarily due to internal macrobioerosion and an increase in microbioerosion. This study emphasizes the interconnected effects of upwelling and carbonate bioerosion on the reef carbonate budget and the ecological turnovers of carbonate producers in tropical coral reefs under environmental change.","[Wizemann, Andre; Nandini, Sri D.; Stuhldreier, Ines; Sanchez-Noguera, Celeste; Westphal, Hildegard; Rixen, Tim; Reymond, Claire E.] ZMT, Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Res, Bremen, Germany; [Nandini, Sri D.] Univ Bremen, Ctr Marine Environm Sci, MARUM, Bremen, Germany; [Westphal, Hildegard] Univ Bremen, Fac Geosci, Bremen, Germany; [Sanchez-Noguera, Celeste] Univ Costa Rica, Ctr Invest Ciencias Mar & Limnol, CIMAR, San Jose, Costa Rica; [Wisshak, Max] Senckenberg Meer, Wilhelmshaven, Germany; [Wild, Christian] Univ Bremen, Fac Biol & Chem, Marine Ecol Dept, Bremen, Germany",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0202887,2018

This study investigated the influence of suspended sediment on reef fish assemblages and habitat composition over a cross-shelf turbidity gradient in the nearshore Pilbara region of Western Australia. The responses of all feeding guilds were analysed to identify feeding guilds vulnerable to elevations in suspended sediment and sedimentation. This study is the first of its kind to utilise both remotely sensed and in situ turbidity data to characterise the general turbidity regime and magnitude of stochastic events. By using the coordinates from a principle coordinates analysis, we were able to capture both the general turbidity conditions and stochastic turbidity spikes at each site, whilst the use of in situ turbidity measurements allowed us to effectively 'groundtruth' the remotely sensed TSS data. Underwater visual census was used to sample the fish assemblage and quantify habitat across the turbidity gradient. Generalised additive mixed models were used to explore the relationships between environmental variables, habitat variables, and fish assemblage metrics. Species richness significantly declined with increasing levels of turbidity. This study identified two key functional groups of fish that are vulnerable to elevated suspended sediment loads. Planktivorous omnivores and herbivorous scrapers decreased in abundance at high turbidity sites. Total biomass of herbivorous scrapers was lower at turbid sites, whilst the biomass of planktivorous omnivores was not related to any of the predictor variables. Changes in the abundance, biomass, and behaviour of these functional groups can have severe consequences for the resilience and recovery of coral reefs. Anthropogenic activities that elevate suspended sediment in regions where coral reef communities exist should consider these implications when designing management plans.","[Moustaka, Molly; Langlois, Tim J.; McLean, Dianne; Bond, Todd; Evans, Richard D.] Univ Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, 35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Evans, Richard D.] Dept Biodivers Conservat & Attract, Marine Sci Program, Sci & Conservat Div, S Perth, WA 6151, Australia; [Fisher, Rebecca] Australian Inst Marine Sci, UWA Oceans Inst Bldg Level 4 35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Fearns, Peter; Dorji, Passang] Curtin Univ, Dept Imaging & Appl Phys, Remote Sensing & Satellite Res Grp, Bentley, WA, Australia",1,10.1007/s00338-018-1690-1,2018

Autotrophy and heterotrophy supply corals with specific omega 3 fatty acids, which can be used as trophic markers and record the contribution of each feeding strategy. This study investigated whether the reef-building coral Mussismilia hispida, endemic to Brazil, is able to shift between predominantly autotrophic and predominantly heterotrophic by monitoring the concentration of fatty acids in the host tissue. We then examined whether shifts are related to changes in temperature and wind stress. For that purpose, M. hispida colonies were monitored for a year with monthly tissue sampling. Symbiont concentration was determined and lipid extraction performed. Four fatty acids were quantitatively analyzed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector: the autotrophy markers: stearidonic acid (SDA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and a heterotrophy marker: cis-gondoic acid (CGA). Three preliminary experiments confirmed the specificity of SDA, DPA and CGA, but not of DHA. Shifts of predominance occurred multiple times during the year and were associated with minimal temperatures and wind stress. Colonies underwent mild bleaching during summer months, which they seemed to compensate with heterotrophic feeding. Our major findings include the validation of three FATM and a trophic index for coral reef ecology studies and also describing the in situ occurrences of shifts between feeding modes, while highlighting the role of temperature and meteorological events.","[Mies, M.; Guth, A.

However, their species diversity and role in nitrogen fixation are poorly understood. We assessed the cyanobacterial diversity of BCMs at four coral reef sites in Curacao, Southern Caribbean. In addition, nitrogen fixation rates of six common mats were measured. Microscopic examinations showed 22 cyanobacterial species, all from the order Oscillatoriales. Species diversity was similar among sites despite differences in overall BCM abundance. Dominant mats were primarily composed of Hydrocoletan glutinosum, Oscillatoria bonnemaisonii or Lyngbya majuscula. However, some mats exhibited highly variable species composition despite consistent macroscopic appearance. 16S rRNA-based phylogeny revealed similar species as those identified by microscopy, with additional sequences of unicellular (Xenococcus and Chroococcidiopsis) and heterocystous (Rivularia and Calothrix) cyanobacteria. Vice versa, morphotypes of Tychonema, Schizothrix and Dichothrix were found by microscopy only. The detection of similar species at the same sites in a study conducted 40 years ago indicates that changes in environmental conditions over these years may have favored indigenous species to bloom, rather than facilitated the introduction and proliferation of invasive species. Nitrogen fixation rates of mats were 3-10 times higher in the light than in the dark. The highest areal nitrogen fixation rate (169.1 mg N m(-2) d(-1)) was recorded in the cyanobacterial patch dominated by O. bonnemaisonii. A scale-up of nitrogen fixation at a site with 26% BCM cover at 7 m depth yielded an aerial rate of 13 mg N m(-2) reef d(-1), which exceeds rates reported in open ocean blooms of Trichodesmiun in the Caribbean. Our results suggest that the Caribbean basin is not only a hotspot for planktonic nitrogen fixation, but also for benthic nitrogen fixation. Because BCMs fix vast amounts of nitrogen, their proliferation will strongly alter the nitrogen budget of coral reefs.","[Brocke, Hannah J.; Piltz, Bastian; den Haan, Joost; de Beer, Dirk] Max Planck Inst Marine Microbiol MPI Bremen, Celsiusstr 1, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Brocke, Hannah J.; Herz, Nicole] Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Ecol ZMT, Fahrenheitstr 6, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Brocke, Hannah J.; Nugues, Maggy M.] PSL Res Univ, EPHE, UPVD CNRS, CRIOBE USR3278, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Piltz, Bastian] Isle Util BV, Overboslaan 8, NL-2101 AM Heemstede, Netherlands; [Abed, Raeid M.

The spatial variation of phytoplankton biomass and primary productivity were significant among the different regions of the atolls, and generally followed the order of outer reef slope < reef flat < lagoon. Phytoplankton biomass might be a more sensitive indicator than nutrients for the habitat differences in coral atoll ecosystem. The lagoon of Huangyan Atoll showed the highest phytoplankton biomass and primary productivity. The phytoplankton biomass and primary productivity were mainly contributed by pico-phytoplankton. Moreover, our results suggested that there might have a threshold value of Chl a for pico-phytoplankton abundance. When Chl a was higher than this threshold value (about 0.5 mu g L-1), the pico-phytoplankton abundance should not linearly increase with the Chl a concentration.

We therefore assessed the effects of sediment loads and overfishing on the nutritional quality and yield to grazing fishes of algal turfs, within the epilithic algal matrix, on a coral reef at Lizard Island, Australia. Low, ambient and high sediment loads were maintained on turf-covered coral tiles, with and without grazer exclusion cages, for 1 month. Subsequently, algal turfs were removed and analysed for organic carbon and nitrogen content. Under grazer exclusion, sediment additions decreased algal turf biomass by approximately 63%, while algal turf biomass was the highest on tiles with sediments removed. In the presence of grazing fishes, algal turfs in all treatments were cropped by grazers to similar low biomass levels. Nitrogen content of algal turfs followed a similar trend. Effectively, added sediments decreased the potential yield of algal turf biomass and nitrogen to grazing fishes by an average of 2000 and 3300%, respectively. Sediments profoundly affect algal turf yield to grazing herbivorous fishes and, therefore, the productivity of algal turf-based food chains, potentially diminishing reef-based fisheries.","[Tebbett, Sterling B.; Bellwood, David R.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Tebbett, Sterling B.; Bellwood, David R.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Purcell, Steven W.] Southern Cross Univ, Natl Marine Sci Ctr, POB 4321, Coffs Harbour, NSW 2450, Australia",1,10.1007/s00338-018-1718-6,2018

Other effects of acidification on coral physiology are less well explored, and recent debate has focused on whether ocean acidification causes a change in Symbiodinium densities within tropical and subtropical reef-building corals. Within the framework of null-hypothesis significance testing, some aquaria experiments have provided evidence for a decrease in symbiont densities within coral tissue under ocean acidification (whilst others have suggested an increase). However, null effects have prevailed in the majority of such experiments, and so the question has remained unresolved. This study attempted to resolve this question using a meta-analytic framework, by establishing the effect sizes for symbiont density change under ocean acidification from a structured search of the literature. A regression of effect size (Hedge's d) versus level of ocean acidification revealed a statistically significant negative relationship, with symbiont density per cm(2) decreasing as the level of ocean acidification increased. The decline amounted to an additional 0.07 standard deviations of difference in symbiont density between corals in control (near present day) and acidified seawater with every 100 mu atm of increase in partial pressure of CO2 in seawater (a relationship with an r(2) of 0.24). A further unresolved question is whether ocean acidification will synergistically exacerbate (or diminish) symbiont density reductions caused by elevated temperature. An analysis of covariance did not reveal a greater decline in symbiont densities with increasing acidification at elevated temperature compared to non-stressful temperature, though this latter analysis should be viewed as exploratory due to a lower sample size. The well-supported evidence for a decline in symbiont densities in tropical and subtropical corals under ocean acidification now provides an impetus for sustained investigation of the consequences of such a change for holobiont functioning and the broader function of the coral reef ecosystem.","[Mason, Robert A.

Pursuit of this goal typically involves testing for associations between community structure and environmental conditions, and in recent years, attention has focused on temperature and seawater pH. Such analyses are helpful in projecting coral reef community structure into the future, but their efficacy depends on the extent to which changes in community structure are correctly associated with causative processes, and whether future conditions are a subset of those experienced in the past. Here, we describe variation from 2014 to 2017 in one environmental factor, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), at 19-m depth on the reefs of St. John, US Virgin Islands, and evaluate the extent to which this factor could cause changes in benthic community structure. The transmission of downwelling surface PAR to 19-m depth (TPAR-19) varied from 2.0 to 40.0% among days, and from 4.8 to 15.8% among months within a year, and was lower and more variable in the autumn versus other seasons. Monthly TPAR-19 was inversely associated with monthly rainfall, suggesting that runoff affected seawater clarity. The monthly diffuse attenuation coefficient (Kd-PAR) varied 1.7-fold from 0.097 to 0.164 m(-1) and was within the range expected for coral reefs. Given the high temporal variation in underwater light intensity, and its importance to foundational reef taxa, understanding of the response of coral reefs to temperature and pH (and other factors) will remain incomplete without closer attention to this physical environmental condition.","[Edmunds, Peter J.; Tsounis, Georgios] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, 18111 Nordhoff St, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; [Boulon, Ralf] 5000 Estate Enighed,PMB 68, St John, VI 00830 USA; [Bramanti, Lorenzo] Univ Paris 06, CNRS, Lab Ecogeochim Environm Benth, LECOB,Sorbonne Univ, Banyuls Sur Mer, France",2,10.1007/s00338-018-1721-y,2018

Here, we analysed the gamma-diversity (gamma-diversity) partitioning of gobiid fishes to evaluate the additive and multiplicative components of alpha and beta-diversity, species replacement and species loss and gain, at four spatial scales: sample units, ecoregions, provinces and realms. The richness of gobies from the realm Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) is represented by 87 species. Along latitudinal and longitudinal gradients, we found that the gamma-diversity is explained by the beta-diversity at both spatial scales, ecoregions and provinces. At the ecoregion scale, species are diverse in the north (Cortezian ecoregion) and south (Panama Bight ecoregion) and between insular and coastal ecoregions. At the province scale, we found that the species turnover between the warm temperate Northeast Pacific (WTNP), Tropical East Pacific (TEaP) and the Galapagos Islands (Gala) was high, and the species nestedness was low. At the ecoregion scale, historical factors, and phylogenetic factors have influenced the hotspots of gobiid fish biodiversity, particularly in the Cortezian, Panama Bight and Cocos Island ecoregions, where species turnover is high across both latitudinal and longitudinal gradients. At the provincial level, we found that the contributions of the beta-diversity from north to south, in the WTNP, TEaP and Gala were high, as result of the high number of unique species. Species turnover was also high at this scale, with a low contribution from species nestedness that was probably due to the low species/gene flow within the provinces.

However, the connectivity of corals between MPAs is still poorly known, especially in the Marine Conservation Corridor of the Eastern Tropical Pacific (MCCETP). Here, we assess the potential connectivity of corals across equatorial eastern Pacific MPAs through a Lagrangian particle-tracking algorithm coupled offline with an ocean-circulation numerical model. Connectivity metrics and graph theory were used to analyze the networks and highlight those MPAs that are critical for maintaining the connectivity of corals across the region. Our results show that the equatorial eastern Pacific MPAs form a relatively well-connected network, at least 40% of coral larvae released per year end up within the boundaries of an MPA. MPAs like Malpelo and Gorgona islands included in the MCCETP were found to be critical for connectivity of corals because of their high between-ness centrality and potential role as stepping-stones between coastal MPAs and offshore MPAs such as the Galapagos Islands. Two pelagic larval duration (PLD) scenarios (40 and 130 days) indicate a quasi-unidirectional larval flow from coastal MPAs toward oceanic MPAs, where the only resilient MPAs (Coiba and Malpelo islands) depend mostly on subsidiary recruitment from MPAs located along the coast of Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia. In the two PLD scenarios, Cocos Island maintains a very low resilience potential. Our results indicate the imperative need to include coastal MPAs in the MCCETP network initiative, since connectivity and resilience of coral reefs in the equatorial eastern Pacific region rely heavily on coastal MPAs.","[Lequeux, Bertrand D.] Univ Mar, Program Marine Biol, Ciudad Univ S-N, San Pedro Pochutla, Oaxaca, Mexico; [Ahumada-Sempoal, Miguel-Angel; Reyes-Hernandez, Cristobal] Univ Mar, Ciudad Univ S-N, San Pedro Pochutla, Oaxaca, Mexico; [Lopez-Perez, Andres] Univ Autonoma Metropolitana, Unidad Iztapalapa, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0202995,2018

This question may be addressed from both a proximate (genetic and ontogenetic) and ultimate (adaptive value and evolutionary origins) perspective, and integrating these perspectives can provide further insights. Over the last few decades we have made great advances in understanding the causes of conspicuous coloration in terrestrial systems, e.g., birds and butterflies, but we still know relatively little about the causes of conspicuous, ""poster"" coloration in coral reef fishes. Of all coral reef fishes, the clownfish Amphiprion percula, is perhaps the most conspicuously colored, possessing a bright orange body with three iridescent white bars bordered with pitch black. Here, we review what is known about the proximate and ultimate causes of the conspicuous coloration of clownfishes Amphiprion sp.: coloration has a heritable genetic basis: coloration is influenced by development and environment; coloration has multiple plausible signaling functions; there is a phylogenetic component to coloration. Subsequently, to provide new insights into the genetic mechanisms and potential functions of A. percula coloration we (i) generate the first de novo transcriptome for this species, (ii) conduct differential gene expression analyses across different colored epidermal tissues, and (iii) conduct gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses to characterize function of these differentially expressed genes. BUSCO indicated that transcriptome assembly was successful and many genes were found to be differentially expressed between epidermal tissues of different colors. In orange tissue, relative to white and black, many GO terms associated with muscle were over-represented. In white tissue, relative to orange and black tissue, there were very few over- or under-represented GO terms. In black tissue, relative to orange and white, many GO terms related to immune function were over-represented, supporting the hypothesis that black (melanin) coloration may serve a protective function.

To identify processes in corals that involve these molecules, PAF and Lyso-PAF biosynthesis was quantified in conditions known to stimulate PAF production in mammals (tissue growth and exposure to elevated levels of ultraviolet light) and in conditions unique to corals (competing with neighbouring colonies over benthic space). Similar to observations in mammals, PAF production was higher in regions of active tissue growth and increased when corals were exposed to elevated levels of ultraviolet light. PAF production also increased when corals were attacked by the stinging cells of a neighbouring colony, though only the attacked coral exhibited an increase in PAF. This reaction was observed in adjacent areas of the colony, indicating that this response is coordinated across multiple polyps including those not directly subject to the stress. PAF and Lyso-PAF are involved in coral stress responses that are both shared with mammals and unique to the ecology of cnidarians.","[d'Auriac, Ines Galtier; Little, Mark; Cobian, Ana; Reyes, Brandon T.; Green, Kevin; Quistad, Steven D.; Rohwer, Forest; Hartmann, Aaron C.] San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Quinn, Robert A.; Nothias, Louis-Felix; Kapono, Clifford A.; Dorrestein, Pieter C.] Univ Calif San Diego, Skaggs Sch Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Smith, Jennifer E.; Deheyn, Dimitri D.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Maughan, Heather] Ronin Inst, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA; [Quistad, Steven D.] PSL Res Univ, Inst Chem Biol & Innovat, ESPCI ParisTech, LGE,CNRS,UMR 8231, Paris, France; [Leray, Matthieu] Smithsonian Inst, Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Panama City, Panama; [Hartmann, Aaron C.] Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Washington, DC 20560 USA",1,10.1098/rspb.2018.1307,2018

Here we quantitatively assess the relative importance of different coral species in structuring fish communities and evaluate whether sampling scale and coral colony size affect the perceived strength of fish-habitat relationships. Fish communities present on colonies of eight coral species (Porites cylindrica, Echinopora horrida, Hydnophora rigida, Stylophora pistillata, Seriatopora hystrix, Acropora formosa, A. tenuis and A. millepora) were examined in the Lizard Island lagoon, Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Additionally, the differences in fish communities supported by three coral species (P. cylindrica, E. horrida, H. rigida) were investigated at three spatial scales of sampling (2x2 m, 1x1 m, 0.5x0.5 m). Substantial differences in fish communities were observed across the different coral species, with E. horrida and H. rigida supporting the most fish species and individuals. Coral species explained more of the variability in fish species richness (20.9-53.6%), than in fish abundance (015%). Most coral species supported distinctive fish communities, with dissimilarities ranging from 50 to 90%. For three focal coral species, a greater amount of total variation in fish species richness and fish abundance was evident at a larger scale of sampling. Together, these results indicate that the structure of reef fish communities is finely tuned to coral species. Loss of preferred coral species could have profound effects on reef fish biodiversity, potentially more so than would be predicted on the basis of declining coral cover alone.","[Komyakova, Valeriya; Jones, Geoffrey P.; Monday, Philip L.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Komyakova, Valeriya; Jones, Geoffrey P.; Monday, Philip L.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Komyakova, Valeriya] Univ Melbourne, Dept Zool, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Komyakova, Valeriya] Inst Marine Res, Pelag Grp, Bergen, Norway",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0202206,2018

We investigates (i) whether sponge cover is negatively correlated to spongivorous fish density, (ii) potential spongivory effects on competitive interactions between sponges and hermatypic corals, and (iii) foraging preferences of spongivorous fishes. Benthic cover and spongivorous fish density were assessed by photo sampling and visual census, respectively. We did not observe a negative correlation of the total density of spongivorous fish with total sponge cover. However, a significant negative correlation between density of fish species Pomacanthus arcuatus and cover of sponge species Scopalina ruetzleri was found. Spongivorous fish consumed preferentially the sponges Desmapsamma anchorata, Niphates erecta, Aplysina cauliformis, and S. ruetzleri, the first two species considered palatable and the second two with chemically defense mechanism. An increase to angelfish density was not related with the number of coral-sponge encounters. Thus, the effects of spongivorous fishes on sponges cover and competitive interactions with hermatypic corals is weaker in Southwestern Atlantic than previously reported in Caribbean coral reefs. We discuss how local human impacts (e.g., fishing and nutrients input) can influence the observed patterns.","[Lorders, Fernanda L.; Miranda, Ricardo J.; Nunes, Jose Anchieta C.

Assessing this potential requires a comprehensive understanding of how versatility in microhabitat use, preference, and selectivity interact with changes in habitat composition along depth gradients. We examined six damselfish species categorized by versatility of shallow-water microhabitat association ('complex-coral-specialists', 'coral-associates', and 'generalists'), along a depth gradient from 10 to 30 m in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea, and tested four important hypotheses. (1) We examined associations with hard-coral and complex-coral microhabitats. Hard-coral association declined with depth more among generalists than coral-associates but complex-coral microhabitat association declined for all species except one complex-coral-specialist. (2) We studied whether microhabitat selectivity declines with depth. Unexpectedly, selectivity increased with depth among both generalist and specialist species. (3) Within species, we tested for positive relationships between fish abundance and preferred microhabitat availability at each depth. However, relationships were stochastic across depths for all but one complex-coral-specialist. (4) Finally, we tested for positive relationships between the number of microhabitats selected by a species and the species' abundance at each depth, finding that species' abundances were not consistently related to microhabitat versatility. Our results suggest that several species currently utilize deep coral microhabitats (30 m), including specialists that strongly associate with vulnerable coral habitats in shallow water. Considerable microhabitat plasticity occurred along the gradient, even amidst stable preferences, and versatile species were not habitat limited, though restricted versatility may limit refuge potential for some species.","[MacDonald, Chancey; Tauati, Mele I.; Jones, Geoffrey P.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Marine Biol & Aquaculture Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [MacDonald, Chancey; Jones, Geoffrey P.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",2,10.1007/s00227-018-3396-x,2018

The restricted biogeographic range sizes of endemic species have been interpreted to indicate low dispersal ability, whereas broad distributions of widespread species are assumed to indicate high dispersal potential. To assess that intuitive link, we analyzed mitochondrial cytochrome b and control region sequence data for two widespread damselfish species (Abudefduf vaigiensis and Chromis vanderbilti) across the Hawaiian Archipelago and broader Indo-Pacific and compared with three Hawaiian endemic damselfishes (A. abdominalis, C. ovalis, and C. verater). The widespread species exhibited less population structure in the Hawaiian Archipelago than the endemics. Across the larger spatial scale of their Indo-Pacific ranges, both widespread damselfish species showed strong and significant population structure. Our comparison of widespread and endemic damselfish species is consistent with the expected trend for widespread species to exhibit more connectivity within the Hawaiian Archipelago, but this pattern may be restricted to certain reef fish families. In addition, widespread species in this study and previous studies, which had little to no population subdivision within archipelagoes, have shown strong genetic structure when analyzed across the broader Indo-Pacific. We conclude that geographic range size may be a better indicator of dispersal ability at smaller (within archipelago) rather than at larger spatial scales (across oceans). Management should note that reef fishes unique to Hawaii seem to have less gene flow across the archipelago than more broadly distributed Indo-Pacific species.","[Tenggardjaja, Kimberly A.; Bernardi, Giacomo] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Bowen, Brian W.] Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI USA",0,10.1007/s00227-018-3395-y,2018

Despite seafood's important role, in many locations the contributions of fisheries and aquaculture to local food security have not been accurately assessed. An overview is provided of current and future contributions of seafood to food security in Hawaii through metrics using a supply chain approach from hook-to-plate, encompassing production and consumption. Hawaii's local seafood production is nearly 21,000 metric tons per year, with similar to 90% sourced from pelagic fisheries, and 6% from reef fisheries. Seafood is a bright spot in the overall Hawaii food system, providing a relatively higher degree of self-sufficiency than other food sources. Annual local production of seafood in Hawaii is estimated at 20,424,243 +/- 1,958,488 kg (mu +/- SD). Accounting for imports and exports, the total locally available seafood (32,450,820 kg +/- 1,571,905 kg) accounts for about 134 +/- 6.5 million meals available every year. Wild-capture fisheries (pelagic and nearshore) in Hawaii are modeled to be able to meet 45% or less of the growing seafood demand in Hawaii by 2040, compared to an estimated 55% in 2015. A projected 20% increase in total seafood demand by 2040 would exceed current average annual local production by up to 37%. Improvement in sustainable fisheries, aquaculture, and innovations in value and supply chains are critical if Hawaii is to improve its seafood security and the food provisioning functions of ocean and coastal environments.","[Teneva, Lida T.; Schemmel, Eva; Kittinger, John N.] Conservat Int, Ctr Oceans, 7192 Kalaniana Ole Hwy,Ste G-230, Honolulu, HI 96825 USA; [Kittinger, John N.] Arizona State Univ, Ctr Biodivers Outcomes, Julie Ann Wrigley Global Inst Sustainabil, Life Sci Ctr, A Wing 451 E Tyler Mall,Room 208, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Kittinger, John N.] Conservat Int, Betty & Gordon Moore Ctr Sci, Arlington, VA 22202 USA",0,10.1016/j.marpol.2018.04.025,2018

However, our ability to impose new management relies on the assessment of vulnerability and adaptive capacity, and the lack of social-ecological data often stifles decision making. Here we test the use of simple fisheries attributes from 33 fishing communities in an understudied, and chronically poor region of the Colombian Pacific, to generate indicators of relative fisheries adaptive capacity, as a proxy for vulnerability to planned management changes. We demonstrate the strengths of this approach using four variables (species assemblage, spatial dependence, gear dependence and compliance), and illustrate how potential threats to livelihoods can be identified early, and with limited data, allowing for management to adapt decision-making accordingly. We show that in the absence of detailed socio-economic information, relatively basic fisheries data recorded by community observers can be applied to decrease uncertainty by providing a rapid characterisation of community vulnerability to management decision-making, in a range of management intervention options.","[Tilley, Alexander; Lopez Angarita, Juliana; Box, Stephen] Smithsonian Marine Stn Ft Pierce, Ft Pierce, FL 34949 USA; [Tilley, Alexander; Lopez Angarita, Juliana] Fdn Talking Oceans, Carrera 16,127-81, Bogota 110121, Colombia; [Lopez Angarita, Juliana] Univ York, Environm Dept, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Herron, Pilar; Espinosa, Silvana] USAID Colombia, BIOREDD Program, Av 4N 6N-67, Cali, Colombia; [Herron, Pilar] Fdn Ecomares, Calle 39N 3CN 89, Cali, Colombia; [Box, Stephen] Rare, 1310 N Courthouse Rd,Suite 110, Arlington, VA 22201 USA",0,10.1016/j.marpol.2018.04.013,2018

About 60% of the worlds bigeye is caught in the Pacific Ocean, where stocks have been subject to overfishing and longline fleets are governed by increased conservation measures. One conservation measure entails multilateral bigeye quota reductions. Since 2010, quota reductions have resulted in four extended closures for Hawaii longliners. Previous research indicated that regulatory closures may result in differential socioeconomic impacts, but little is known about how four extended closures may affect fishers and fishing trips in a diverse longline fleet with 142 active vessels. The purpose of this research is to assess the trip-level impacts of closures on Hawaii longliners and determine whether impacts could be lessened while sill meeting conservation measures. To do this, economic data and longline logbooks for Hawaii longliners were analyzed from 2010 to 2015, and 28 longline fishers were interviewed in Fall 2015. Vessels allowed to fish during closures spent nearly two more days at sea not fishing compared to the same month in years without a closure, with no significant difference in trip length. Vessels with special permits are allowed to fish closer to port during closures, while the larger vessels (25% of the fleet) were restricted from retaining bigeye between 32 and 61 days a year, raising equity concerns across the fleet. Our findings also suggest that two levels of collective action may be needed to meet Pacific-wide economic and conservation goals for an economically and ecologically important pelagic common-pool marine resource.","[Ayers, Adam L.] JIMAR, 1000 Pope Rd,Marine Sci Bldg 312, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Ayers, Adam L.; Hospital, Justin; Boggs, Christofer] NOAA, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 1845 Wasp Blvd,Bldg 176, Honolulu, HI 96818 USA",0,10.1016/j.marpol.2018.04.032,2018

Recent otolith micro-chemistry studies of coral reef fish have demonstrated that cohorts of larvae can move through similar paths and settle within a few meters one from another. However, little is known about the processes involved in the formation and maintenance of these cohorts. Here we use a biophysical modeling approach to examine whether local hydrodynamics, various individual behaviors, or larval schooling can explain cohesive patterns observed for Neopomacentrus miryae in the Gulf of Aqaba/Eilat (Red Sea), and whether schooling is feasible in terms of initial encounter probability and cohesiveness maintenance. We then examine the consequences of schooling behavior on larval settlement success and connectivity. Our results indicate that: (1) Schooling behavior is necessary for generating cohesive dispersal patterns, (2) Initial larval encounter of newly-hatched larvae is plausible, depending mainly on initial larval densities and patchiness, and (3) schooling behavior increases the rate of larval settlement while decreasing the percentage of realized connections. Together with mounting evidence of cohesive dispersal, this numerical study demonstrates that larval schooling throughout the pelagic phase is realistic, and has a significant effect on settlement success and connectivity patterns. Future research is needed to understand the mechanisms of fission-fusion dynamics of larval cohorts and their effect on dispersal. Our findings should be considered in future efforts of larval dispersal models, specifically in the context of marine connectivity and the planning of marine protected area networks.","[Berenshtein, Igal] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, Etat Campus, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Berenshtein, Igal; Kiflawi, Moshe] Intemnivers Inst Marine Sci Eilat, Elat, Israel; [Berenshtein, Igal; Paris, Claire B.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Dept Ocean Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Gildor, Hezi; Amitai, Yael] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Earth Sci, Jerusalem, Israel; [Fredj, Erick] Jerusalem Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Jerusalem, Israel; [Kiflawi, Moshe] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, Beer Sheva, Israel",1,10.3389/fmars.2018.00254,2018

Here, we developed a new community-wide scan CWS) approach, analogous to the genome-wide scan, to identify fish species that significantly contribute, beyond the socio-environmental and species richness effects, to the biomass and coral cover on Indo-Pacific reefs. We found that only a limited set of species (51 out of approx. 400, = approx. 13%), belonging to various functional groups and evolutionary lineages, are strongly and positively associated with fish biomass and live coral cover. Many of these species have not previously been identified as functionally important, and thus may be involved in unknown, yet important, biological mechanisms that help sustain healthy and productive coral reefs. CWS has the potential to reveal species that are key to ecosystem functioning and services and to guide management strategies as well as new experiments to decipher underlying causal ecological processes.","[Maire, Eva; Villeger, Sebastien; Aliaume, Catherine; Mouillot, David] Univ Montpellier, UMR IRD CNRS UM IFREMER 9190, MARBEC, F-34095 Montpellier, France; [Maire, Eva; Hoey, Andrew S.; Cinner, Joshua; Mouillot, David] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Graham, Nicholas A.

When temperatures become too high corals bleach, expelling their symbiotic, photosynthetic microalgae (Symbiodinium), which they depend on for much of their nutritional requirements. Prolonged bleaching has led to widespread coral mortality and the severity and frequency of bleaching events are predicted to increase in the future. Coral bleaching tolerance is influenced by the thermal tolerance of the Symbiodinium harboured, and these microbial members of the coral holobiont may be able to evolve more rapidly than the coral host itself. Here, we examined the response of replicate cultures of five genetically distinct Symbiodinium strains (A3c, two types of D1, G3, and F1) to increasing temperatures over the course of approximately one year. For three Symbiodinium types (types A3c, G3, and F1), we observed a stable adaptive change at the end of this exposure period, which equated to only 41-69 asexual generations. The long-term selected Symbiodinium culture replicates (SS) showed faster growth rates under short-term, acute heat stress, and in some cases higher photosynthetic efficiencies, compared to wild-type populations (WT).

Effective solutions to the crisis facing coral reefs depend in part on understanding the context under which different types of conservation benefits can be maximized. Our global analysis of nearly 1,800 tropical reefs reveals how the intensity of human impacts in the surrounding seascape, measured as a function of human population size and accessibility to reefs (""gravity""), diminishes the effectiveness of marine reserves at sustaining reef fish biomass and the presence of top predators, even where compliance with reserve rules is high. Critically, fish biomass in high-compliance marine reserves located where human impacts were intensive tended to be less than a quarter that of reserves where human impacts were low. Similarly, the probability of encountering top predators on reefs with high human impacts was close to zero, even in high-compliance marine reserves. However, we find that the relative difference between openly fished sites and reserves (what we refer to as conservation gains) are highest for fish biomass (excluding predators) where human impacts are moderate and for top predators where human impacts are low. Our results illustrate critical ecological trade-offs in meeting key conservation objectives: reserves placed where there are moderate-to-high human impacts can provide substantial conservation gains for fish biomass, yet they are unlikely to support key ecosystem functions like higher-order predation, which is more prevalent in reserve locations with low human impacts.","[Cinner, Joshua E.; Maire, Eva; Huchery, Cindy; Graham, Nicholas A.

The putative release of some specialized metabolites in the surrounding seawater is still a matter of debate, but the presence of such compounds in the environment of sponges is thought to influence the behaviour of various mobile organisms and may, thus, contribute to benthic ecosystem structuring and functioning. Underwater Mediterranean caves are characterized by stable environmental conditions and sessile species assemblages dominated by sponges. A two-choice test system was developed to assess the response of two cave-dwelling crustaceans (Hemimysis margalefi and Palaemon serratus) and two other species living in shallow water environments (Leptomysis sp. and Palaemon elegans) to various seawater treatments: control- seawater from an exposed coastline, control+ seawater coming from an underwater cave, and seawater conditioned with four Mediterranean sponges commonly found at the entrance of underwater caves (Aplysina cavernicola, Haliclona fulva, Oscarella tuberculata and Spongia officinalis) or their chemical extracts. We tested the swimming behaviour of these crustacean species in three complementary experiments: (1) control seawater vs. cave seawater; (2) control seawater vs. seawater conditioned with the sponge community, (3) control seawater vs. seawater containing chemical extracts of the same sponge community. Both cave-dwelling crustaceans were attracted by the seawater conditioned with the sponge community, while Leptomysis sp. spent more time in the control seawater and P. elegans exhibited indifferent responses. All four crustacean species avoided the seawater containing the sponge extracts. Interestingly, the response shown by the crustaceans was affected by the time of day. A comparative and untargeted metabolomic approach was applied to the surrounding seawater to identify putative chemomarkers that could explain the crustaceans' behaviours. Among other compounds found in the seawater, a family of metabolites with molecular formulae in accordance with those of oxylipin derivatives is released by sponges and may, therefore, serve as chemical cues acting as kairomones in the homing behaviour of cave-dwelling crustaceans.","[Santonja, Mathieu; Greff, Stephane; Le Croller, Marie; Thomas, Olivier P.; Perez, Thierry] Aix Marseille Univ, Avignon Univ,Stn Marine Endoume, Inst Mediterraneen Biodivers & Ecol Marine & Cont, CNRS,IRD,UMR 7263, Rue Batterie Lions, F-13007 Marseille, France; [Santonja, Mathieu] Univ Rennes, CNRS, ECOBIO, UMR 6553, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Thomas, Olivier P.] Natl Univ Ireland, Marine Biodiscovery Lab, Sch Chem, Galway NUI Galway, Univ Rd, Galway H91 TK33, Ireland; [Thomas, Olivier P.] Natl Univ Ireland, Ryan Inst, Galway NUI Galway, Univ Rd, Galway H91 TK33, Ireland",0,10.1007/s00227-018-3377-0,2018

We, therefore, examined DMSP content within four key species of soft coral in February and July-August of 2017, including two temperate species from Sydney Harbour (Erythropodium hicksoni, Capnella gaboensis) and two tropical species from the Great Barrier Reef (Sinularia sp., Sarcophyton sp.). We compared DMSP content of these soft coral species to that of commonly occurring temperate (Plesiastrea versipora) and tropical (Acropora aspera) scleractinian coral species. DMSP content was normalised to coral protein content, with soft coral DMSP content highly variable across species and locations [56-539 nmol (mg protein)(-1)], and lower than for the tropical [1242-4710 nmol (mg protein)(-1)], but not temperate [465-1984 nmol (mg protein)(-1)] scleractinian species. Further comparison with previously published values demonstrated that soft coral DMSP content falls within the ""low-mid range"" of scleractinian corals. Notably, DMSP content was also higher in summer samples than winter samples for the scleractinian corals, but did not differ between seasons for soft corals. Such contrasting dynamics of DMSP production by soft corals compared to scleractinian corals indicates that the regulation of DMSP content differs between these two important benthic cnidarian groups, potentially as a consequence of dissimilar ecophysiological roles for this compound.","[Haydon, Trent D.; Seymour, Justin R.; Suggett, David J.] Univ Technol Sydney, Climate Change Cluster, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia",1,10.1007/s00227-018-3367-2,2018

Marine species have been a difficult challenge in that respect, due to the difficulty in assessing population sizes and the open nature of such populations. Small, isolated islands with endemic species offer an opportunity to groundtruth population size estimates with empirical data and investigate the genetic consequences of such small populations. Here we focus on two endemic species of reef fish, the Clipperton damselfish, Stegastes baldwini, and the Clipperton angelfish, Holacanthus limbaughi, on Clipperton Atoll, tropical eastern Pacific. Visual surveys, performed over almost two decades and four expeditions, and genetic surveys based on genomic RAD sequences, allowed us to estimate kinship and genetic diversity, as well as to compare population size estimates based on visual surveys with effective population sizes based on genetics. We found that genetic and visual estimates of population numbers were remarkably similar. S. baldwini and H. limbaughi had population sizes of approximately 800,000 and 60,000, respectively. Relatively small population sizes resulted in low genetic diversity and the presence of apparent kinship. This study emphasizes the importance of small isolated islands as models to study population dynamics of marine organisms.","[Crane, Nicole L.] Cabrillo Coll, Dept Biol, Aptos, CA USA; [Tariel, Juliette; Bernardi, Giacomo] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Caselle, Jennifer E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Marine Sci Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Friedlander, Alan M.] Natl Geog Soc, Pristine Seas, Washington, DC USA; [Friedlander, Alan M.] Univ Hawaii, Dept Biol, Fisheries Ecol Res Lab, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Ross Robertson, D.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0198901,2018

However, little is known about how these two stressors interact and influence coral reef ecosystem functioning. Using a six-week nutrient addition experiment, we measured the impact of elevated nitrate (NO3-) and phosphate (PO43-) on net community calcification (NCC) and net community production (NCP) rates of individual taxa and combined reef communities. Our study had four major outcomes: (i) NCC rates declined in response to nutrient addition in all substrate types, (ii) the mixed community switched from net calcification to net dissolution under medium and high nutrient conditions, (iii) nutrients augmented pH variability through modified photosynthesis and respiration rates, and (iv) nutrients disrupted the relationship between NCC and aragonite saturation state documented in ambient conditions. These results indicate that the negative effect of NO3- and PO43- addition on reef calcification is likely both a direct physiological response to nutrients and also an indirect response to a shifting pH environment from altered NCP rates.

In this study, we investigated the evolution of visual signals and chemical defences in a putative mimicry ring of nudibranch molluscs. First, we demonstrated that the appearance of a group of red spotted nudibranchs molluscs was similar from the perspective of potential fish predators using visual modelling and pattern analysis. Second, using phylogenetic reconstruction, we demonstrated that this colour pattern has evolved multiple times in distantly related individuals. Third, we showed that these nudibranchs contained different chemical profiles used for defensive purposes. Finally, we demonstrated that although levels of distastefulness towards Palaemon shrimp remained relatively constant between species, toxicity levels towards brine shrimp varied significantly.

This site experienced warm-water bleaching in 2011, 2014, and 2015. In 2017, we obtained cores of the dominant calcifying coral at this site, Orbicella faveolata, to understand how calcification rates were impacted by bleaching and how they affected the reef-wide CaCO3 budget. Bleaching depressed O. faveolata growth and the decline of this one species led to an overestimation of mean (+/- std. error) reef-wide CaCO3 production by + 0.68 (+/- 0.167) to + 1.11 (+/- 0.236) kg m(-2) year(-1) when using the static ReefBudget coral growth inputs.

Here, we qualitatively describe the use of sUAS to survey the spatial characteristics of coral cover and the distribution of coral bleaching across patch reefs in KAne'ohe Bay, Hawaii, and address limitations and anticipated technology advancements within the field of UAS. Overlapping sub-decimeter low-altitude aerial reef imagery collected during the 2015 coral bleaching event was used to construct high-resolution reef image mosaics of coral bleaching responses on four KAn'ohe Bay patch reefs, totaling similar to 60,000 m(2). Using sUAS imagery, we determined that paled, bleached and healthy corals on all four reefs were spatially clustered. Comparative analyses of data from sUAS imagery and in situ diver surveys found as much as 14% difference in coral cover values between survey methods, depending on the size of the reef and area surveyed. When comparing the abundance of unhealthy coral (paled and bleached) between sUAS and in situ diver surveys, we found differences in cover from 1 to 49%, depending on the depth of in situ surveys, the percent of reef area covered with sUAS surveys and patchiness of the bleaching response. This study demonstrates the effective use of sUAS surveys for assessing the spatial dynamics of coral bleaching at colony-scale resolutions across entire patch reefs and evaluates the complementarity of data from both sUAS and in situ diver surveys to more accurately characterize the spatial ecology of coral communities on reef flats and slopes.","[Levy, Joshua] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Appl Res Lab, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Hunter, Cynthia] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Biol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Lukacazyk, Trent] Univ Porto, Praca Gomes Teixeira, P-4099002 Porto, Portugal; [Lukacazyk, Trent] FlightWave USA, Santa Monica, CA 90401 USA; [Franklin, Erik C.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA",1,10.1007/s00338-018-1662-5,2018

Since adult coral colonies are sessile, the settlement preferences of larvae have a strong impact on the competition for space that corals will face post-metamorphosis and will therefore influence long-term survival. Laboratory-based studies show that in simplified systems coral larvae use cues to guide them to suitable settlement locations, an adaptation that enhances post-settlement survival. Settlement preferences have also been reported from the field, where coral larvae encounter a wide variety of different potential settlement surfaces as the availability of free substratum (bare space) changes over time. In this field-based study, the abundance of different encrusting organisms and bare space present on settlement tiles was compared to their abundance under newly settled pocilloporid and poritid recruits, to determine if recruits choose their settlement substratum randomly. Tiles deployed for 3, 9, 12 and 15 months were used to determine if settlement choice varied as a function of benthic community successional stage. We found that pocilloporid and poritid larvae changed their settlement preference depending on the age of the benthic community they encountered. They reacted neutrally to crustose coralline algae (CCA) on tiles deployed for 3 months when bare space was abundant, but showed a clear preference for settlement on CCA on tiles deployed for 9-15 months once bare space was limited. Simultaneously, poritid recruits showed a decreasing preference over time to settle on biofilm. This change in preference is not linked to the availability of CCA because its abundance did not change significantly between tiles deployed for 3 versus 9-15 months. These results indicate that coral recruits react to several settlement cues simultaneously, guiding them to different settlement locations as the benthos changes over time. Furthermore, recruits from both families reacted similarly, suggesting that this is an evolutionarily old adaption.","[Elmer, Franziska; Bell, James J.; Gardner, Jonathan P.

To understand the mechanisms underlying the recovery process of coral communities, colony abundance and size distribution were followed on reefs around Pelorus Island, located in the inshore central region of the Great Barrier Reef, following a severe tropical cyclone in 2011 that caused dramatic loss of coral communities. Permanent quadrats (600 m(2)) were monitored biannually between 2012 and 2016, and individual coral colonies were counted, sized and categorized into morphological types. The abundance of coral recruits and coral cover were also examined using permanent quadrats and random line intercept transects, respectively. The number of colonies in the smallest size class (4-10 cm) increased substantially during the study period, driving the recovery of coral populations. The total number of coral colonies 5 yr post-cyclone reached between 73 and 122% of pre-cyclone levels though coral cover remained between 16 and 31% of pre-cyclone levels, due to the dominance of small coral colonies in the recovering communities. Temporal transitions of coral demography (i.e., colony-size distributions) illustrated that the number of recently established coral populations overtook communities of surviving colonies. Coral recruits (< 4 cm in size) also showed increasing patterns in abundance over the study period, underscoring the importance of larval supply in coral recovery. A shift in morphological composition of coral communities was also observed, with the relative abundance of encrusting corals reduced post-cyclone in contrast to their dominance prior to the disturbance. This study identifies the fine-scale processes involved in the initial recovery of coral reefs, providing insights into the dynamics of coral demography that are essential for determining coral reef resilience following major disturbance.","[Sato, Yui; Bell, Sara C.; Menendez, Patricia; Bourne, David G.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, PMB 3 Townsville MC, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Nichols, Cassandra; Fry, Kent] Earthwatch Australia, 126 Bank St, S Melbourne, Vic 3205, Australia; [Menendez, Patricia] Univ Queensland, Sch Math & Phys, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Bourne, David G.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",1,10.1007/s00338-018-1668-z,2018

Because coral reefs often have high geomorphic complexity, circulation patterns and the duration of exposure, or ""local residence time"" of a water parcel, can vary substantially over small distances. Different meteorologic and oceanographic forcings can further alter residence time patterns over reefs. Here, spatially dense Lagrangian surface current drifters and Eulerian current meters were used to characterize circulation patterns and resulting residence times over different regions of the reefs in Faga'alu Bay, American Samoa, during three distinct forcing periods: calm, strong winds, and large waves. Residence times varied among different geomorphic zones of the reef and were reflected in the spatially varying health of the corals across the embayment. The relatively healthy, seaward fringing reef consistently had the shortest residence times, as it was continually flushed by wave breaking at the reef crest, whereas the degraded, sheltered, leeward fringing reef consistently had the longest residence times, suggesting this area is more exposed to land-based sources of pollution. Strong wind forcing resulted in the longest residence times by pinning the water in the bay, whereas large wave forcing flushed the bay and resulted in the shortest residence times. The effect of these different forcings on residence times was fairly consistent across all reef geomorphic zones, with the shift from wind to wave forcing shortening mean residence times by approximately 50%. Although ecologically significant to the coral organisms in the nearshore reef zones, these shortened residence times were still 2-3 times longer than those associated with the seaward fringing reef across all forcing conditions, demonstrating how the geomorphology of a reef environment sets a first-order control on reef health.","[Storlazzi, C.

Reef fish larvae are capable of recognizing and behaviorally responding to a variety of sensory cues when assessing settlement site locations. The presence of resident conspecifics for site attached coral reef fishes could indicate a quality location, but may result in negative interactions through aggression from already-established individuals. For anemonefishes, where space on a sea anemone is limited and breeding is restricted to one adult pair, settlement preferences may depend on the number and sex of the occupants. Here we undertook both aquarium-based olfactory trials and a field experiment to determine the role resident anemonefish individuals have on sea anemone site selection in the spine cheek anemonefish, Premnas biaculeatus. We show larvae are able to identify the occupant saturation state and sex of the resident occupants based on chemical cues alone, with larvae preferring the chemical cues produced by a single male to a single female, the single fish to an empty sea anemone, and an empty sea anemone to a sea anemone containing an adult pair. These behavioral preferences were reflected in the settlement preferences of larvae when assessed in the natural environment. We hypothesize that the ability of resident fish to evict incoming larvae combined with the selective pressure on larvae to locate an ideal habitat has resulted in the larval ability to accurately identify habitat where settlement and future breeding opportunities are most likely achieved.","[Dixson, Danielle L.] Univ Delaware, Sch Marine Sci & Policy, 700 Pilottown Rd, Lewes, DE 19958 USA; [Dixson, Danielle L.; Jones, Geoffrey P.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Dixson, Danielle L.; Jones, Geoffrey P.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",0,10.1007/s00338-018-1676-z,2018

Ocean acidification associated with the increasing CO2 partial pressure in the atmosphere can potentially induce oxidative stress with consequent cellular damage in corals and hydrocorals. In the present study, parameters related to oxidative status were evaluated in the hydrocoral Millepora alcicornis exposed to three different levels of seawater acidification using a mesocosm system. CO2-driven acidification of seawater was performed until reaching 0.3, 0.6 and 0.9 pH units below the current pH of seawater pumped from the coral reef adjacent to the mesocosm. Therefore, treatments corresponded to control (pH 8.1), mild (pH 7.8), intermediate (pH 7.5) and severe (pH 7.2) seawater acidification. After 0, 16 and 30 d of exposure, hydrocorals were collected and the following parameters were analyzed in the holobiont: antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP), total glutathione (GSHt) concentration, reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione ratio (GSH/GSSG), lipid peroxidation (LPO) and protein carbonyl group (PC) levels. ACAP was increased in hydrocorals after 16 d of exposure to intermediate levels of seawater acidification. GSHt and GSH/GSSG did not change over the experimental period. LPO was increased at any level of seawater acidification, while PC content was increased in hydrocorals exposed to intermediate and severe seawater acidification for 30 d. These findings indicate that the antioxidant defense system of M. alcicornis is capable of coping with acidic conditions for a short period of time (16 d). Additionally, they clearly show that a long-term (30 d) exposure to seawater acidification induces oxidative stress with consequent oxidative damage to lipids and proteins, which could compromise hydrocoral health.","[Luz, Debora Camacho; Zebral, Yuri Dornelles] Univ Fed Rio Grande, Inst Ciencias Biol, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Fisiol, Ave Italia Km 8,Campus Carreiros, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil; [Klein, Roberta Daniele; Bianchini, Adalto] Univ Fed Rio Grande, Inst Ciencias Biol, Ave Italia Km 8,Campus Carreiros, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil; [Marques, Joseane Aparecida; de Barros Marangoni, Laura Fernandes] Univ Fed Rio Grande, Programa Posgrad Oceanog Biol, Inst Oceanog, Ave Italia Km 8,Campus Carreiros, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil; [Marques, Joseane Aparecida; de Barros Marangoni, Laura Fernandes; Pereira, Cristiano Macedo; Pires, Debora de Oliveira; Barreira e Castro, Clovis; Calderon, Emiliano Nicolas; Bianchini, Adalto] Inst Coral Vivo, Rua Coqueiros,Parque Yaya, BR-45807000 Santa Cruz Cabralia, BA, Brazil; [Pereira, Cristiano Macedo] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Programa Posgrad Zool, Museu Nacl, Parque Quinta Boa Vista, BR-20940040 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Santos Duarte, Gustavo Adolpho; Pires, Debora de Oliveira; Barreira e Castro, Clovis; Calderon, Emiliano Nicolas] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Museu Nacl, Parque Quinta Boa Vista, BR-20940040 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Calderon, Emiliano Nicolas] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro NUPEM UFRJ, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Ambientais & Conservaca, Nucleo Ecol & Desenvolvimento Socioambiental Maca, Av Sao Jose do Barreto 764, BR-27965045 Macae, RJ, Brazil",1,10.1007/s00338-018-1681-2,2018

These biophysical linkages are poorly correlated with genetic connectivity patterns, which resolve many reciprocal connections and suggest a less sparse network. These results are difficult to reconcile with genetic data which indicate that individual reefs are diverse, suggesting important contributions of sexual reproduction and recruitment. Larval connectivity models highlight potential resources for recovery, such as areas with high larval export like the Lower Keys, or areas that are well connected to most other regions on the FRT, such as the Dry Tortugas.","[Drury, Crawford; Lirman, Diego] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Dept Marine Biol & Ecol, 4600 Rickenbacker Cswy, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Paris, Claire B.; Kourafalou, Vassiliki H.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Dept Ocean Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Cswy, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Drury, Crawford] Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, 46-007 Lilipuna Rd, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA",0,10.1007/s00338-018-1683-0,2018

Emerging interest in applying passive acoustic monitoring and soundscape analysis to measure coral reef habitat characteristics and track ecological patterns is hindered by a poor understanding of the most common and abundant sound producers on reefs-the snapping shrimp. Here, we sought to address several basic biophysical drivers of reef sound by investigating acoustic activity patterns of snapping shrimp populations on two adjacent coral reefs using a detailed snap detection analysis routine to a high-resolution 2.5-month acoustic dataset from the US Virgin Islands. The reefs exhibited strong diel and lunar periodicity in snap rates and clear spatial differences in snapping levels. Snap rates peaked at dawn and dusk and were higher overall during daytime versus nighttime, a seldom-reported pattern in earlier descriptions of diel snapping shrimp acoustic activity. Small differences between the sites in snap rate rhythms were detected and illustrate how analyses of specific soundscape elements might reveal subtle between-reef variation. Snap rates were highly correlated with environmental variables, including water temperature and light, and were found to be sensitive to changes in oceanographic forcing. This study further establishes snapping shrimp as key players in the coral reef chorus and provides evidence that their acoustic output reflects a combination of environmental conditions, celestial influences, and spatial habitat variation. Effective application of passive acoustic monitoring in coral reef habitats using snap rates or snapping-influenced acoustic metrics will require a mechanistic understanding of the underlying spatial and temporal variation in snapping shrimp sound production across multiple scales.","[Lillis, Ashlee; Mooney, T.

The irregular mesh microstructure could be plesiomorphic among sabellid tube structures. Oriented fibers in homogeneous matrix microstructure involves some kind of chemical control mechanisms that asserts the same orientation of all fibers (Notaulax sp. nov.).

The survival of larvae and their subsequent recruitment can drive the dynamics of reef populations. Here we show that the recruitment of the snapper Lutjanus carponotatus to One Tree Island in the Capricorn Bunker Group, in the southern Great Barrier Reef, was highly variable over 23 years. We predicted that the currents in the Capricorn Bunker Group, including their wind driven components and the Capricorn Eddy (a nearby transient oceanic eddy), would affect patterns of recruitment. A biophysical model was used to investigate this prediction. L. carponotatus were collected from One Tree Island and the dates when they were in the plankton as larvae were determined from their otoliths. The winds present during the pelagic phases of the fish were examined; they were found to have survived either longshore (SSE) winds that induced little cross shelf movement in the larval plume or cross shelf (ENE) winds that induced little longshore movement. The unidirectional transportation of the larval plume in these conditions was favorable for recruitment as it kept the plume concentrated in the Capricorn Bunker Group. These winds were more prevalent in the periods of peak L. carponotatus production that preceded high recruitment. Dispersal under average winds (6.2 m s(-1) from the prevailing ESE) and strong winds (velocity 1.5 times average), with and without the Capricorn Eddy, was also modeled. Each of these combinations were less favorable for recruitment than the longshore and cross shelf winds larval L. carponotatus survived before reaching OTI. The larval plume was comparatively less concentrated in the Capricorn Bunker Group under average winds. Strong winds transported the larval plume far longshore, to the NW, away from the Capricorn Bunker Group, while the Capricorn Eddy transported larvae seaward into oceanic waters. Larval swimming could counteract these dispersive forces; however, significant dispersion had occurred before larvae developed strong swimming and orientation abilities. This study provides a physical proxy for the recruitment of snapper. Further, we have demonstrated that great insights into recruitment variability can be gained through determining the specific conditions experienced by survivors.","[Schlaefer, Jodie A.; Wolanski, Eric; Kingsford, Michael J.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Reef & Ocean Ecol Lab, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Schlaefer, Jodie A.; Kingsford, Michael J.] Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Wolanski, Eric] James Cook Univ, Trop Water & Aquat Ecosyst Res TopWATER, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Lambrechts, Jonathan] Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Mech Mat & Civil Engn, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",0,10.3389/fmars.2018.00193,2018

To test this hypothesis, species-based records and fisher interviews were gathered over one year within a large, demand-driven coral-reef fishery in Chuuk, Micronesia. We first assessed catch statistics with respect to high windspeeds and moon phases that are known to constrain both catch and effort. While lower daily catch success was predicted by higher windspeeds and greater lunar illumination, total daily landings fluctuated less than fishing success across environmental gradients. Instead, daily landings were mainly driven by the number of flights from Chuuk to Guam (i.e., international demand). Given that demand masked local drivers of overall catch volume, we further evaluated species-based indicators of fisheries exploitation. Most target species (75%) had either a positively skewed size distribution or proportional contributions that were dependent upon favorable conditions (i.e. season and moon phases). Skewed size distributions indicated truncated growth associated with fishing mortality, and in turn, suggested that size-based management policies may be most effective for these species. In contrast, environmentally-constrained catch success indicated species that may be more susceptible to growing fishing footprints and may respond better to gear/quota/area policies compared to size policies. Species-based responses offered a simplified means to combine species into fisheries management units. Finally, a comparison of commercial and subsistence landings showed higher vulnerability to fishing among species preferentially targeted by commercial fisheries, offering new insights into how commercial harvesting can disproportionately impact resources, despite having lower annual catch volumes.","[Cuetos-Bueno, Javier; Hernandez-Ortiz, Dalia; Houk, Peter] Univ Guam, Marine Lab, Mangilao, GU 96923 USA; [Graham, Curtis] Chuuk Dept Marine Resources, Chuuk, Micronesia",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0198068,2018

Currently, there is no easy, reliable and universally accepted method to detect if a fish has been exposed to cyanide during the capture process. A promising non-invasive technique for detecting thiocyanate ions, the metabolic byproduct excreted by exposed fish, has been reported in the literature. In an effort to validate this method, four cyanide exposure studies on Amphiprion ocellaris (common clownfish) were carried out over three years. Fish were either exposed to the same (25 ppm) or twice the concentration (50 ppm) as the previsouly published method. Over 100 water samples of fish exposed to cyanide were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC with a C-30 column treated with polyethylene glycol and UV detector operating at 220 nm. No thiocyanate was detected beyond the analytical standards and positive controls prepared in seawater. As an alternate means of detecting thiocyanate, water samples and thiocyanate standards from these exposures were derivatized with monobromobimane (MBB) for LC-MS/MS analysis. Thiocyanate was detected in standards with concentrations as low as 0.6 mu g/L and quantified to 1 mu g/L, but thiocyanate could not be detected in any of the water samples from fish exposed to cyanide with this method either, confirming the HPLC results. Further, we calculated both the mass balance of thiocyanate and the resultant plausible dosage of cyanide from the data reported in the previously published method. These calculations, along with the known lethal dosage of cyanide, further suggests that the detection of thiocyanate in aquarium water is not a viable method for assessing fish exposure to cyanide.","[Breen, Nancy E.; Metivier, Rebecca] Roger Williams Univ, Dept Chem & Phys, Bristol, RI 02809 USA; [Lowenstein, Julie; Metivier, Rebecca; Rhyne, Andrew L.] Roger Williams Univ, Dept Biol Marine Biol & Environm Sci, Bristol, RI 02809 USA; [Andrade, Lawrence] Domin Diagnost, North Kingstown, RI USA",1,10.1371/journal.pone.0196841,2018

Here we document how early successional benthic coral reef communities change in situ along gradients of carbon dioxide (CO2), and the consequences of these changes on rates of community photosynthesis, respiration, and light and dark calcification. Ninety standardised benthic communities were grown on PVC tiles deployed at two shallow-water volcanic CO2 seeps and two adjacent control sites in Papua New Guinea. Along the CO2 gradient, both the upward facing phototrophic and the downward facing cryptic communities changed in their composition. Under ambient CO2, both communities were dominated by calcifying algae, but with increasing CO2 they were gradually replaced by non-calcifying algae (predominantly green filamentous algae, cyanobacteria and macroalgae, which increased from similar to 30% to similar to 80% cover). Responses were weaker in the invertebrate communities, however ascidians and tube-forming polychaetes declined with increasing CO2. Differences in the carbonate chemistry explained a far greater amount of change in communities than differences between the two reefs and successional changes from five to 13 months, suggesting community successions are established early and are under strong chemical control. As pH declined from 8.0 to 7.8, rates of gross photosynthesis and dark respiration of the 13-month old reef communities (upper and cryptic surfaces combined) significantly increased by 10% and 20%, respectively, in response to altered community composition. As a consequence, net production remained constant. Light and dark calcification rates both gradually declined by 20%, and low or negative daily net calcification rates were observed at an aragonite saturation state of <2.3. The study demonstrates that ocean acidification as predicted for the end of this century will strongly alter reef communities, and will significantly change rates of community metabolism.","[Noonan, Sam H.

Recent work has focused on measuring macroalgal abundance in response to anthropogenic stressors. To accurately evaluate the effects of human impacts, however, it is necessary to understand the effects of natural processes on reef condition. To better understand how coral reef communities are influenced by natural processes, we investigated how spatial and seasonal changes in environmental conditions (temperature and PAR) influence benthic community structure, and the composition and frequency of coral-algal interactions across eight distinct zones and over a 23-month period at Heron reef on the southern Great Barrier Reef. Hard coral cover and macroalgal density showed distinct spatio-temporal variations, both within and between zones. Broad hard coral cover was significantly higher at the reef slope sites compared to the lagoon and was not significantly influenced by season. The composition and biomass of macroalgae increased in spring and declined in summer, with maximum macroalgal abundance corresponding with average temperatures of between 22 and 24 degrees C and average 24 h PAR of 300-500 mu mol qanta m(-2) s(-1). Changes in macroalgal biomass further influenced the composition and frequency of coral-algal interactions, however the incidence of coral-algal contact was best explained by coral cover. The results presented here emphasize that natural levels of macroalgae and coral-algal interactions are context-specific, and vary not only with-in zones, but in somewhat predictable seasonal cycles. Further, these results emphasize that the frequency of coral-algal interactions is dependent on hard coral, not just macroalgal cover, and an increase in coral-algal interactions does not necessarily translate to degradation of coral reefs.","[Brown, Kristen T.; Bender-Champ, Dorothea; Kubicek, Andreas; van der Zande, Rene; Achlatis, Michelle; Hoegh-Guldberg, Ove; Dove, Sophie G.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Coral Reef Ecosyst Lab, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Brown, Kristen T.; van der Zande, Rene; Achlatis, Michelle; Hoegh-Guldberg, Ove; Dove, Sophie G.] Univ Queensland, Global Change Inst, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Brown, Kristen T.; Bender-Champ, Dorothea; Kubicek, Andreas; van der Zande, Rene; Achlatis, Michelle; Hoegh-Guldberg, Ove; Dove, Sophie G.] Univ Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, St Lucia, Qld, Australia",0,10.3389/fmars.2018.00181,2018

We combine child nutrition data from the Demographic Health Survey with coastal proximity and coral reef habitat diversity, and condition to empirically test human benefits of marine natural resources in differing development contexts. Our results indicate that coastal children have a reduced likelihood of severe stunting in Haiti but have increased likelihoods of stunting and reduced dietary diversity in the Dominican Republic.

Coral reefs modify overlying water column chemistry through biogeochemical processes such as net community organic carbon production (NCR) and calcification (NCC). However, the relative importance and influence of these processes on seawater carbonate chemistry vary across multiple functional scales (defined here as space, time, and benthic community composition), and have not been fully constrained. Here, we use Bermuda as a case study to assess (1) spatiotemporal variability in physical and chemical parameters along a depth gradient at a rim reef location, (2) the spatial variability of total alkalinity (TA) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) over distinct benthic habitats to infer NCC:NCP ratios [< several km(2); rim reef vs. seagrass and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) sediments] on diel timescales, and (3) compare how TA-DIC relationships and NCC:NCP vary as we expand functional scales from local habitats to the entire reef platform (10's of km(2)) on seasonal to interannual timescales. Our results demonstrate that TA-DIC relationships were strongly driven by local benthic metabolism and community composition over diel cycles. However, as the spatial scale expanded to the reef platform, the TA-DIC relationship reflected processes that were integrated over larger spatiotemporal scales, with effects of NCC becoming increasingly more important over NCR.

Recent suggestions that calcification is primarily controlled by organic molecules and the biological activity of the coral polyp imply that ocean acidification may not affect skeletal accretion. The basis for these suggestions relies heavily on correlating the presence of organic matter with the orientation and disorder of aragonite crystals in the skeleton, carrying the assumption that organic matter observed in the skeleton was produced by the polyp to control calcification. Here we use Raman spectroscopy to test whether there are differences in organic matter content between coral skeleton and abiogenic aragonites precipitated from seawater, both before and after thermal annealing (heating). We measured the background fluorescence and intensity of C-H bonding signals in the Raman spectra, which are commonly attributed to coral polyp-derived skeletal organic matrix (SOM) and have been used to map its distribution. Surprisingly, we found no differences in either fluorescence or C-H bonding between abiogenic aragonite and coral skeleton. Annealing reduced the molecular disorder in coral skeleton, potentially due to removal of organic matter, but the same effect was also observed in the abiogenic aragonites. The presence of organic molecules in the abiogenic aragonites is further supported by measurements of N content and delta N-15. Together, our data suggest that some of what has been interpreted in previous studies as polyp-derived SOM may actually be seawater-sourced organic matter or some other signal not unique to biogenic aragonite. Finally, we create a high-resolution Raman map of a Pociiopora skeleton to demonstrate how patterns of fluorescence and elevated calcifying fluid aragonite saturation state (Omega(Ar)) along centers of calcification are consistent with both biological and physico-chemical controls. Our aim is to advance discussion on biological mediation of calcification and the implications for coral resilience in a high-CO2 world.","[DeCarlo, Thomas M.] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA, Australia; [DeCarlo, Thomas M.] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Grad Sch, Crawley, WA, Australia; [DeCarlo, Thomas M.] Univ Western Australia, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Hen, Haojia] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, Taipei, Taiwan; [Farfan, Gabriela A.] MIT, Woods Hole Oceanog Inst Joint Program Oceanog & A, Woods Hole, MA USA",3,10.3389/fmars.2018.00170,2018

Reef recovery relies on recruitment of young fishes for the replenishment of functionally important taxa. Acoustic cues guide the orientation, habitat selection, and settlement of many fishes, but these processes may be impaired if degradation alters reef soundscapes. Here, we report spatiotemporally matched evidence of soundscapes altered by degradation from recordings taken before and after recent severe damage on Australia's Great Barrier Reef. Postdegradation soundscapes were an average of 15 dB re 1 mu Pa quieter and had significantly reduced acoustic complexity, richness, and rates of invertebrate snaps compared with their predegradation equivalents. We then used these matched recordings in complementary light-trap and patch-reef experiments to assess responses of wild fish larvae under natural conditions. We show that postdegradation soundscapes were 8% less attractive to presettlement larvae and resulted in 40% less settlement of juvenile fishes than predegradation soundscapes; postdegradation soundscapes were no more attractive than open-ocean sound. However, our experimental design does not allow an estimate of how much attraction and settlement to isolated postdegradation soundscapes might change compared with isolated predegradation soundscapes. Reductions in attraction and settlement were qualitatively similar across and within all trophic guilds and taxonomic groups analyzed. These patterns may lead to declines in fish populations, exacerbating degradation. Acoustic changes might therefore trigger a feedback loop that could impair reef resilience.

We used data from 717 fisheries-independent reef fish monitoring surveys from 2012 to 2015 around the main Hawaiian Islands as well as site-level data on benthic habitat, oceanographic conditions, and human population density, to develop a hierarchical, linear Bayesian model that explains spatial variation in: (1) herbivorous and (2) total reef fish biomass. We found that while human population density negatively affected fish assemblages at all surveyed areas, there was considerable variation in the natural capacity of different areas to support reef fish biomass. For example, some areas were predicted to have the capacity to support ten times as much herbivorous fish biomass as other areas. Overall, the model found human population density to have negatively impacted fish biomass throughout Hawaii, however the magnitude and uncertainty of these impacts varied locally. Results provide part of the basis for marine spatial planning and/or MPA-network design within Hawaii.","[Gorospe, Kelvin D.; Heenan, Adel] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Joint Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Gorospe, Kelvin D.; Heenan, Adel; Gove, Jamison M.; Williams, Ivor D.; Brainard, Russell E.] NOAA, Ecosyst Sci Div, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96818 USA; [Donahue, Megan J.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI USA; [Heenan, Adel] Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Anglesey, Wales",1,10.3389/fmars.2018.00162,2018

Here we show that the reproductive output of a coral population is not proportional to the cover of coral present. Instead, when compared to declining populations nearby, high cover coral populations produced up to four times more larvae per square centimeter of tissue, resulting in up to 200 times higher larval production per square meter of reef. Importantly, corals that produced more larvae did not produce smaller larvae, as predicted by resource allocation theory. Instead, higher fecundity corresponded to higher energetic lipid reserves in higher cover coral populations. In the wake of unprecedented global coral bleaching, our findings suggest that the largest reductions in coral reproduction may occur when corals are lost from previously healthy populations.","[Hartmann, Aaron C.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Ctr Marine Biodivers & Conservat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Marhaver, Kristen L.] Univ Calif Merced, Merced, CA 95343 USA; [Marhaver, Kristen L.; Vermeij, Mark J.

We find that standard reserves with a diameter of 1-2 km can achieve partial protection (50% of the maximum number of individuals) of 56% of all simulated species. Partial protection of the most important fishery species, and of species with diverse functional roles, required 2-10 km wide reserves.

While it is true that, in totality, populations in both the Philippines and Indonesia rely heavily on pelagic fisheries for animal protein, this commentary demonstrates that coral reef fisheries contribute substantially to the food and livelihood security of coastal communities, which make up the poorest and most food insecure sector of the economy. There is also significant growth potential in nearshore fisheries that can be captured by working to recover currently degraded coral reef ecosystems.

Results were analyzed for different sub-regions on the Sunda Shelf (Gulf of Thailand, Malacca Strait, Java Sea) and show realistic and different levels, signs and pronounced temporal variability in air-sea CO2 flux. The Gulf of Thailand changes from an atmospheric CO2 sink during the boreal winter to a CO2 source in summer due to higher water temperatures, while other sub-regions as well as the entire averaged Sunda Shelf act as a continuous source of CO2 for the atmosphere. However, increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations weakened this source function during the simulation period. In 2007, the model simulations showed even a first flux inversion, in course of which the Java Sea took up CO2. The simulated trends suggest that the entire Sunda Shelf will turn into a permanent sink for atmospheric CO2 within the next 30-35 years if current trends remain constant. Considering the period between 2010 and 2014, coral reef calcification enhanced the average CO2 emission of the Sunda Shelf by more than 10% from 15 to 17 Tg C yr(-1) due to lowering the pH and increasing the partial pressure of CO2 in surface water. During the entire period of simulation, net reef calcification decreased although increasing seawater temperature mitigated effects of reduced CO2 emission and the resulting decrease of the pH values on reef calcification. Our realistic simulation results already without consideration of any biological processes suggest that biological processes taking up and releasing CO2 are currently well balanced in these tropical regions. However, the counteracting effects of climate change on the reef calcification, on other biological processes and the carbonate system need to be investigated in more detail.

In 2015, a major bleaching event was declared as the ""3rd global coral bleaching event"" by the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, impacting a large number of reefs in every major ocean. The Red Sea was no exception, and we present herein in situ observations of the status of coral reefs in the central Saudi Arabian Red Sea from September 2015, following extended periods of high temperatures reaching upwards of 32.5 degrees C in our study area. We examined eleven reefs using line-intercept transects at three different depths, including all reefs that were surveyed during a previous bleaching event in 2010. Bleaching was most prevalent on inshore reefs (55.6% +/- 14.6% of live coral cover exhibited bleaching) and on shallower transects (41% +/- 10.2% of live corals surveyed at 5m depth) within reefs. Similar taxonomic groups (e.g., Agariciidae) were affected in 2015 and in 2010. Most interestingly, Acropora and Porites had similar bleaching rates (similar to 30% each) and similar relative coral cover (similar to 7% each) across all reefs in 2015. Coral genera with the highest levels of bleaching (>60%) were also among the rarest (<1% of coral cover) in 2015. While this bodes well for the relative retention of coral cover, it may ultimately lead to decreased species richness, often considered an important component of a healthy coral reef. The resultant long-term changes in these coral reef communities remain to be seen.","[Monroe, Alison A.; Ziegler, Maren; Roik, Anna; Rothig, Till; Hardenstine, Royale S.; Emms, Madeleine A.; Jensen, Thor; Voolstra, Christian R.; Berumen, Michael L.] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Div Biol & Environm Sci & Engn, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; [Roik, Anna] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Marine Microbiol, Dusternbrooker Weg 20, Kiel, Germany; [Rothig, Till] Univ Hong Kong, Swire Inst Marine Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",3,10.1371/journal.pone.0195814,2018

Non-commercial fisheries in this case comprise recreational, subsistence, and cultural harvest, which may be exchanged, but are not sold. By combining those data with reported commercial catch data, we estimated annual catch of nearshore reef-associated fisheries in the main Hawaiian Islands over the study period to be 1,167,758 +/- 43,059 kg year(-1) (mean +/- standard error). Average annual commercial reef fish catch over the same time period-184,911 kg year-1-was 16% of the total catch, but that proportion varied greatly among islands, ranging from 23% on O'ahu to 5% on Moloka'i.

Animal systems amenable for comparatively studying pair bonding are important for identifying underlying biological mechanisms, but mostly exist in mammals. Better establishing fish systems will enable comparison of pair bonding mechanisms across taxonomically distant lineages that may reveal general underlying mechanistic principles. We examined the utility of wild butterflyfishes (f: Chaetodontidae; g: Chaetodon) for comparatively studying pair bonding. Using stochastic character mapping, we provide the first analysis of the evolutionary history of butterflyfish sociality, revealing that pairing is ancestral, with at least seven independent transitions to gregarious grouping and solitary behavior since the late Miocene. We then formally verified social systems in six sympatric and widespread species representing a clade with one ancestrally reconstructed transition from paired to solitary grouping at Lizard Island, Australia. In situ observations of the size, selective affiliation and aggression, fidelity, and sex composition of social groups confirmed that Chaetodon baronessa, C. lunulatus, and C. vagabundus are predominantly pair bonding, whereas C. rainfordi, C. plebeius, and C. trifascialis are predominantly solitary. Even in the predominantly pair bonding species, C. lunulatus, a proportion of adults (15%) are solitary. Importantly, inter-and intra-specific differences in social systems do not co-vary with other previously established attributes, including parental care. Hence, the proposed butterflyfish populations are promising for inter-and intra-species comparative analyses of pair bonding and its mechanistic underpinnings. Avenues for further developing the system are proposed, including determining whether the aforementioned utility of these species applies across their geographic disruptions.","[Nowicki, Jessica P.; Cowman, Peter F.; Walker, Stefan P.

While such heat-induced loss of algal symbionts (zooxanthellae) directly affects anemones and corals physiologically, this damage may also cascade on to other animal symbionts. Metabolic rate is an integrative physiological trait shown to relate to various aspects of organismal performance, behaviour and locomotor capacity, and also shows plasticity during exposure to acute and chronic stressors. As climate warming is expected to affect the physiology, behaviour and life history of animals, including ectotherms such as fish, we measured if residing in bleached versus unbleached sea anemones (Heteractis magnifica) affected the standard (i.e. baseline) metabolic rate and behaviour (activity) of juvenile orange-fin anemonefish (Amphiprion chrysopterus). Metabolic rate was estimated from rates of oxygen uptake Mo-2), and the standard metabolic rate (Mo-2mm) of anemonefish from bleached anemones was significantly higher by 8.2% compared with that of fish residing in unbleached anemones, possibly due to increased stress levels. Activity levels did not differ between fish from bleached and unbleached anemones. As Mo-2mm reflects the minimum cost of living, the increased metabolic demands may contribute to the negative impacts of bleaching on important anemonefish life history and fitness traits observed previously (e.g. reduced spawning frequency and lower fecundity).","[Norin, Tommy; Crespel, Ame Prime Lie; Killen, Shaun S.] Univ Glasgow, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Graham Kerr Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Mills, Suzanne C.; Cortese, Daphne; Beldade, Ricardo] CRIOBE USR 3278 EPHE CNRS UPVD PSL, BP 1013, F-98769 Moorea, French Polynesi, France; [Mills, Suzanne C.; Cortese, Daphne; Beldade, Ricardo] Lab Excellence CORAIL, Paris, France; [Beldade, Ricardo] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, MARE, Lisbon, Portugal",0,10.1098/rspb.2018.0282,2018

Models and empirical studies have suggested that the depletion of large-bodied sharks in coral reef ecosystems triggers a trophic cascade that could affect the benthic community, favoring algae over coral. The hypothesized cascade is based on the premise that sharks prey on large piscivorous teleost fish that in turn prey on key herbivorous fish. Analysis of nitrogen-stable isotopes (delta N-15) from white muscle tissue revealed neither adult or juvenile Caribbean reef sharks were significantly enriched in N-15 compared with sympatric predatory teleost species. Linear regression found no evidence of an ontogenetic increase in nitrogen with increasing body size for Caribbean reef sharks; however, there was a significant positive relationship between body size and carbon isotope (delta C-13) values. These results suggest that Caribbean reef sharks in isolated systems do not act as the apex predator in coral reef ecosystems primarily feeding on large-bodied sympatric teleosts. Instead, Caribbean reef sharks form part of an upper trophic-level predator guild alongside large-bodied teleosts, which makes the predicted trophic cascade as a result of the removal of reef sharks unlikely. Moreover, the body size-delta C-13 relationship suggests Caribbean reef sharks exhibit ontogenetic and individual variation in where they feed. The ecological role of this species is, therefore, complex and contextual, similar to carcharhinid species in the Indo-Pacific, emphasizing the need to further elucidate the interactions between reef sharks and the overall coral reef ecosystem so as to best inform effective conservation and management of the species.","[Bond, Mark E.; Valentin-Albanese, Jasmine] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11790 USA; [Babcock, Elizabeth A.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Hussey, Nigel E.] Univ Windsor Biol Sci, 401 Sunset Ave, Windsor, ON N9B 3PC, Canada; [Bond, Mark E.; Heithaus, Michael R.; Chapman, Demian D.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 3000 NE 151st St, North Miami, FL 33181 USA",1,10.1007/s00227-018-3322-2,2018

Using flumes (5.0 x 0.3 x 0.3 m) located outdoors in Moorea, French Polynesia, we assembled local back reef communities with similar to 25% coral cover, and tested their response to pCO(2) levels of 344, 633, 870 and 1146 mu atm. Incubations began in late Austral spring (November 2015), and net community calcification (G(net)) and net community primary production (P-net) were measured prior to treatments, 24 h after treatment began, and biweekly or monthly thereafter until early Austral autumn (March 2016). G(net) was depressed under elevated pCO(2) over 4 months, although the magnitude of the response varied over time. The proportional decline in G(net) as a function of saturation state of aragonite (Omega(ar)) depended on the initial Omega(ar), but was 24% for a decline in Omega(ar) from 4.0 to 3.0, which is nearly twice as sensitive to variation in Omega(ar) than the previously published values for the net calcification of ex situ coral colonies. However, community G(net) was less sensitive to Omega(ar) than coral reefs that have been analyzed in situ. P-net was unaffected by pCO(2), but P-net and G(net) expressed on a hourly time base were positively associated, thus revealing the tight coupling between these metabolic processes. The high sensitivity of Gnet to pCO(2) for the back reef of Moorea, versus lower sensitivity of individual coral colony calcification to pCO(2), underscores the challenges of scaling-up experimental results on the effects of pCO(2) from coral reef organisms to coral reef communities.","[Carpenter, R.

Within the tropics, average temperature and thermal variation can differ among populations and consequently low-latitude populations may respond differently to increased temperatures than higher latitude tropical populations. In this study, we investigate the long-term effects of climate change relevant temperature increases on commonly measured condition metrics for a low-latitude population of damselfish (Acanthochromis polyacanthus). Adult fish were randomly assigned to one of the three seasonally cycling treatments: (1) current average ocean temperatures for the collection locations, (2) 1.5 degrees C, or (3) 3 degrees C higher than current average temperatures. Treatments were maintained for approximately 10 months. At the end of the experimental period, Fulton's K and hepatosomatic index were calculated for fish from each treatment group and critical thermal limit - (CTMax) was measured for a subset of fish at control temperatures. Fish mortality was recorded throughout the experimental period, as well as at the end of the experimental period after the introduction of a secondary exercise stressor. No significant effect of temperature was observed on fish condition (Fulton's K and hepatosomatic index); however, significant mortality was observed for fish maintained at 3 degrees C higher than current average temperatures. When a secondary exercise stressor was introduced, significant mortality was also observed at 1.5 degrees C higher than current average temperatures. Acute exposure to higher temperatures - (CTMax) suggested a much higher thermal tolerance for this population than long-term mortality, producing a thermal limit of 37.1 degrees C compared with a chronic thermal limit of 33 degrees C. Our results show that some basic measures of fish condition may not be capable of detecting lethal and sublethal effects of increased temperature. The results of this study are consistent with the hypothesis that low-latitude species are already living close to their thermal maximum.","[Rodgers, G. G.; McCormick, M.

Species-specific TACs, based on stock assessments conducted prior to the commencement of fishing, were established for all fish and invertebrate species presumed to be fished by the fishery. By analysing the selectivity of the PNG fishery in 2012, a large portion (74.9%) of the managed fish diversity (n = 267 species) was found to be ""weakly"" to ""strongly"" avoided relative to their availability. More than half (53.2%; n = 142) of the fish species with TACs were never fished in 2012. Of those species with TACs that were actually fished, 76.8% (n = 96) of fish and all invertebrate catches never exceeded 1% of their TACs. Catches of only seven fish species exceeded 10% of their TACs. Catch records also identified 124 fish species that were fished in the absence of species-specific TACs. Unbiased recursive partitioning was used to examine ecological attributes of these species to help identify flaws in the methods used for initial TAC assignment. Refining the role species-specific TACs play in the management of this fishery is necessary to optimise managerial resources. The lessons learned from this approach to marine aquarium fishery management are likely to be of interest and value to PNG, other developing island nations, and marine aquarium fisheries globally.","[Militz, Thane A.; Southgate, Paul C.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Australian Ctr Pacific Islands Res, Maroochydore, Australia; [Militz, Thane A.; Southgate, Paul C.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Fac Sci Hlth Educ & Engn, Maroochydore, Australia; [Kinch, Jeff] Natl Fisheries Author, Natl Fisheries Coll, Kavieng, Papua N Guinea; [Schoeman, David S.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Sci & Engn, Sippy Downs, Qld 4556, Australia; [Schoeman, David S.] Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Dept Zool, Ctr African Conservat Ecol, Port Elizabeth, South Africa",1,10.1016/j.marpol.2017.12.017,2018

Understanding this linkage is essential for management planning to enhance the conservation and sustainable use of ecosystems and their values to human well-being. This study evaluates the impacts of coral reef conservation and marine protected areas (MPAs) on the well-being of fishing communities in Central Vietnam. The Cu Lao Cham MPA is chosen as the case study. Coral reef health and four aspects of human well-being (i.e., catch rate [also related to food security], access to the resource, employment, and income) are investigated following the protection in this MPA. Data on the four different aspects were gathered from different sources. The results show that there is good evidence for how coral reef conservation can transfer the flow of benefits from the ecosystem to local people. However, trade-offs also occur as a result of the development of tourism, including the degradation of fish resources and the environment. The managers of the MPA and the community should take into account trade-offs in resource management and should focus on appropriate MPA planning and fisheries management outside the MPA to achieve better outcomes for coral reef ecosystems and the present and future needs of the local community.","[Quach Thi Khanh Ngoc] Nha Trang Univ, Fac Econ, 02 Nguyen Dinh Chieu, Nha Trang, Vietnam",3,10.1016/j.marpol.2017.12.015,2018

This study examined the independent and combined effects of short-term exposure to elevated CO, and boat noise on the predator prey interactions of a pair of common coral reef fishes (Pomacentrus wardi and its predator, Pseudochromis fuscus). Successful capture of prey by predators was the same regardless of whether the pairs had been exposed to ambient control conditions, the addition of either playback of boat noise, elevated CO2 (925 mu atm) or both stressors simultaneously. The kinematics of the interaction were the same for all stressor combinations and differed from the controls. The effects of CO2 or boat noise were the same, suggesting that their effects were substitutive in this situation. Prey reduced their perception of threat under both stressors individually and when combined, and this coincided with reduced predator attack distances and attack speeds. The lack of an additive or multiplicative effect when both stressors co-occurred was notable given the different mechanisms involved in sensory disruptions and highlights the importance of determining the combined effects of key drivers to aid in predicting community dynamics under future environmental scenarios.","[McCormick, Mark I.; Watson, Sue-Ann; Allan, Bridie J.

We applied network theory to 4 years of acoustic telemetry data for grey reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) at Palmyra, an unfished atoll, to assess their potential role in nutrient dynamics throughout this remote ecosystem. We evaluated the dynamics of habitat connectivity and used network metrics to quantify shark-mediated nutrient distribution. Predator movements were consistent within year, but differed between years and by sex. Females used higher numbers of routes throughout the system, distributing nutrients over a larger proportion of the atoll. Extrapolations of tagged sharks to the population level suggest that prey consumption and subsequent egestion leads to the heterogeneous deposition of 94.5 kg d(-1) of nitrogen around the atoll, with approximately 86% of this probably derived from pelagic resources.

This study examined the metapopulation structure of three decapod species with different pelagic larval duration (PLD) from twelve coral reef complexes of the Gulf of Mexico. The dispersion of larvae was analyzed through the use of a realistic numerical simulation of the Gulf of Mexico with the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model. To study the transport and dispersion of particles in near-surface waters, a particle-tracking subroutine was run using as input the currents from the model. The simulation consisted of the launch of 100 passive particles (virtual larvae) every 24 hours from each reef throughout five years, and tracked for as long as 210 days. Results indicated that species with a short PLD, Mithraculus sculptus (PLD 8-13 days), had a weak connection among the reefs, but higher self-recruitment, especially on the narrow western shelf. The species with a longer PLD, Dromia erythropus (28-30 days), had a stronger connection among neighboring reefs (< 300 km). Finally, the species with an even longer PLD, Stenopus hispidus (123-210 days), had a wider potential distribution than the other species. Circulation on synoptic, seasonal and interannual scales had differential effects on the larval dispersal of each species. The metapopulation structure of M. sculptus and D. erythropus seemed to combine features of the non-equilibrium and the patchy models, whereas that of S. hispidus presumably fit to a patchy model. These findings support previous observations that indicate that species with longer PLD tend to occupy larger areas than species with short PLD, although recruitment of juveniles to the adult populations will also depend on other factors, such as the availability of suitable habitats and the ability to colonize them.","[Sanvicente-Anorve, Laura] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Mary & Limnol, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Zavala-Hidalgo, Jorge] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Ciencias Atmosfera, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Allende-Arandia, Eugenia] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ingn, Lab Ingn & Proc Costeros, Catedra CONACyT, Sisal, Yucatan, Mexico; [Hermoso-Salazar, Margarita] Comis Nacl Conocimiento & Uso Biodiversidad, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0193457,2018

Endoparasite abundance also negatively influenced success in this test. Visual discrimination performance was also impaired in damselfish experimentally infected with gnathiid (Crustacea: Isopoda) ectoparasites. Neither cleaner absence nor gnathiid infection affected performance in spatial recognition or reversal learning tests. Injection with immune-stimulating lipopolysaccharide did not affect visual discrimination performance relative to saline-injected controls, suggesting that cognitive impairments are not due to an innate immune response.

Effective ridge-to-reef management requires improved understanding of land-sea linkages and decision-support tools to simultaneously evaluate the effects of terrestrial and marine drivers on coral reefs, mediated by anthropogenic activities. Although a few applications have linked the effects of land cover to coral reefs, these are too coarse in resolution to inform watershed-scale management for Pacific Islands. To address this gap, we developed a novel linked land-sea modeling framework based on local data, which coupled groundwater and coral reef models at fine spatial resolution, to determine the effects of terrestrial drivers (groundwater and nutrients), mediated by human activities (land cover/use), and marine drivers (waves, geography, and habitat) on coral reefs. We applied this framework in two 'ridge-to-reef' systems (H (a) over bar 'ena and Ka (u) over bar ap (u) over bar lehu) subject to different natural disturbance regimes, located in the Hawaiian Archipelago.

In marine systems, over-exploitation of small-scale fisheries creates problems such as reduced biodiversity and lower catches. However, long-term documentation of how governance and associated changes in fishing gears may have contributed to such declines is often lacking. Using fisher interviews, we characterized fishing gear dynamics over 60 years (1950-2010) in a coral reef ecosystem in the Philippines subject to changing fishing regulations. In aggregate fishers greatly diversified their use of fishing gears. However, most individual fishers used one or two gears at a time (mean number of fishing gears < 2 in all years). Individual fishing effort (days per year) was fairly steady over the study period, but cumulative fishing effort by all fishers increased 240%. In particular, we document large increases in total effort by fishers using nets and diving. Other fishing gears experienced less pronounced changes in total effort over time. Fishing intensified through escalating use of non-selective, active, and destructive fishing gears. We also found that policies promoting higher production over sustainability influenced the use of fishing gears, with changes in gear use persisting decades after those same policies were stopped. Our quantitative evidence shows dynamic changes in fishing gear use over time and indicates that gears used in contemporary small-scale fisheries impact oceans more than those used in earlier decades.","[Selgrath, Jennifer C.; Vincent, Amanda C.

In total 387 samples from 21 sites were analysed using mtDNA and 13 microsatellite loci. Analysis included estimation of genetic diversity and population differentiation. A haplotype network was inferred using mtDNA. Nuclear markers were used in Bayesian clustering and a principal component analysis. Both markers confirmed strong genetic differentiation between WIO and Eastern Indian Ocean (EIO) populations, and a shallower population structure among Malagasy and East African mainland populations. Limited gene flow across the Mozambique Channel may be explained by its complex oceanography, which could cause local retention of larvae, limiting dispersal between Madagascar and the East African coast. Two other potential current-mediated barriers to larval dispersal suggested in the WIO, the split of the SEC at approximately 10 degrees S and the convergence of the Somali Current with the East African Coast Current at approximately 3 degrees S, were not found to form a barrier to gene flow in this species.","[Huyghe, Filip; Kochzius, Marc] VUB, Marine Biol Ecol & Biodivers, Brussels, Belgium",1,10.1371/journal.pone.0193825,2018

The Outlooks are generated by applying the algorithm used in CRW's operational satellite coral bleaching heat stress monitoring, with slight modifications, to the sea surface temperature (SST) predictions from NCEP's operational Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CFSv2). Once a week, the probability of heat stress capable of causing mass coral bleaching is predicted for 4-months in advance. Each day, CFSv2 generates an ensemble of 16 forecasts, with nine runs out to 45-days, three runs out to 3-months, and four runs out to 9-months. This results in 28-112 ensemble members produced each week. A composite for each predicted week is derived from daily predictions within each ensemble member. The probability of each of four heat stress ranges (Watch and higher, Warning and higher, Alert Level 1 and higher, and Alert Level 2) is determined from all the available ensemble members for the week to form the weekly probabilistic Outlook. The probabilistic 4-Month Outlook is the highest weekly probability predicted among all the weekly Outlooks during a 4-month period for each of the stress ranges. An initial qualitative skill analysis of the Outlooks for 2011-2015, compared with CRW's satellite-based coral bleaching heat stress products, indicated the Outlook has performed well with high hit rates and low miss rates for most coral reef areas. Regions identified with high false alarm rates will guide future improvements. This Outlook system, as the first and only freely available global coral bleaching prediction system, has been providing critical early warning to marine resource managers, scientists, and decision makers around the world to guide management, protection, and monitoring of coral reefs since 2012. This has been especially valuable during the third global coral bleaching event that started in mid-2014 and extended into mid-2017. The Outlook system is an integrated component of CRW's global decision support system for coral bleaching.

This is particularly true for many reef fishes where larval stages disperse offshore, often spending weeks to months in the pelagic realm before settling to shallow-water reefs. Our ability to predict reef fish settlement and subsequent recruitment and population dynamics depends on our ability to characterize how biological processes interact with the dynamic physical environment. Here we develop and apply an individual-based model that combines biological processes with high-resolution physical forcing to predict larval fish dispersal and settlement over time and space. Our model tracks individual larval fish from spawning to settlement and allows for the inclusion of biologically relevant stochasticity (individual variability) in modeled processes. Our model is also trait-based, which allows individuals to vary in life history characteristics, making it possible to mechanistically link the resulting variability in settlement probabilities to underlying traits such as spawning date and location, pelagic larval duration (PLD), body morphology, etc. We employ our biophysical model to examine how biology interacts with the physical environment to shape settlement predictions for reef fish off western and southern Hawai'i Island. Linked to prevailing surface currents, we find increased probabilities of settling associated with shorter PLDs and fish spawned in southern and southwestern locations. Superimposed on this, eddies, common to leeward Hawaii Island, offer a second pathway to successful settlement for individuals with longer PLDs, particularly for fish spawning in summer months. Finally, we illustrate how lunar-timed spawning as well as morphological features (e.g., fin and head spines) may impact settlement success by altering the mortality landscape experienced by larvae. This work identifies life history characteristics that predict the self-recruitment pathways necessary for population persistence for the relatively isolated Hawai`i Island. Our results can be used to develop future hypotheses regarding temporal and spatial variation in recruitment for reef fishes on Hawai'i Island and beyond.","[Wong-Ala, Jennifer A. T.

Survival was unaffected by exposure to either elevated stable or diel cycling pCO(2) conditions in both species. For A. polyacanthus there was a non-significant trend of decreased standard length and wet weight under stable, elevated pCO(2) conditions, whereas values in both the diel cycling treatments were closer to those observed under control conditions. A similar non-significant trend was observed for Am. percula, except that exposure to stable, elevated pCO(2) conditions resulted in slightly longer and heavier fish. Finally, otolith size, shape and symmetry in both species were unaffected by exposure to either elevated stable or diel cycling pCO(2) conditions. Overall, our results suggest that the growth, survival and otolith development of juvenile coral reef fishes under ocean acidification is unlikely to be affected, in isolation, by diel cycles in pCO(2).","[Jarrold, Michael D.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Jarrold, Michael D.; Munday, Philip L.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",3,10.1007/s00227-018-3311-5,2018

Despite the importance of understanding these interactions, a methodological framework to synthesize spatially explicit data of such drivers is lacking. To fill this gap, we established a transferable data synthesis methodology to integrate spatial data on environmental and anthropogenic drivers of coral reefs, and applied this methodology to a case study location-the Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI). Environmental drivers were derived from time series (2002-2013) of climatological ranges and anomalies of remotely sensed sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a, irradiance, and wave power. Anthropogenic drivers were characterized using empirically derived and modeled datasets of spatial fisheries catch, sedimentation, nutrient input, new development, habitat modification, and invasive species. Within our case study system, resulting driver maps showed high spatial heterogeneity across the MHI, with anthropogenic drivers generally greatest and most widespread on O'ahu, where 70% of the state's population resides, while sedimentation and nutrients were dominant in less populated islands. Together, the spatial integration of environmental and anthropogenic driver data described here provides a first-ever synthetic approach to visualize how the drivers of coral reef state vary in space and demonstrates a methodological framework for implementation of this approach in other regions of the world. By quantifying and synthesizing spatial drivers of change on coral reefs, we provide an avenue for further research to understand how drivers determine reef diversity and resilience, which can ultimately inform policies to protect coral reefs.","[Wedding, Lisa M.; Walecka, Hilary R.; Crowder, Larry B.; Erickson, Ashley] Stanford Univ, Ctr Ocean Solut, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; [Lecky, Joey; Falinski, Kim; Oleson, Kirsten L.

Iconic images of cleaner fish entering the mouths of predatory fish clients to remove ectoparasites epitomize their mutual benefit. Experimental manipulations of cleaner wrasse reveal declines in fish size and growth, and population abundance and diversity of client fishes in the absence of cleaner wrasse. Fishes grow more slowly and are less abundant and diverse on reefs without cleaner wrasse, both for larger species that are regularly cleaned and have high ectoparasite loads (""attractive species""), and for those smaller species that are rarely cleaned and are rarely infested with parasites (""unattractive species""). We therefore considered whether these previously observed declines in individual and population parameters on reefs without cleaners were related to increased ectoparasite infestation using an attractive species (Hemigymnus melapterus, Labridae) and an unattractive species (Pomacentrus amboinensis, Pomacentridae). Traps with these fish as a form of bait were deployed to sample blood-sucking gnathiid ectoparasites (Gnathiidae: Isopoda) on reefs from which cleaners (Labroides dimidiatus, Labridae) have been removed for 13 yr. Cleaner fish could not enter traps to access the clients/hosts, but gnathiids could enter the traps to infest hosts; thus, this method sampled the indirect effect of cleaners on gnathiid infestation of fish. Infestation was higher on reefs without cleaners than on those with them. The effect was only detected during the daytime when cleaners are active and only on the attractive species (H. melapterus). Thus, cleaner presence indirectly reduced fish exposure to parasites in a species that is highly susceptible to parasites, but not in one that is rarely infested with parasites. This suggests that cleaner presence indirectly reduces exposure of a common fish species to harmful parasites, which may explain some observed benefits in fishes at this location.","[Grutter, A.

Here, we used baited remote underwater video to describe benthic habitat and fish assemblage structure from 10 to 80 m depth at Apo Island, a well-managed marine protected area in the Philippines. We conducted surveys 2 yr after two storms (in 2011 and 2012) caused severe damage to shallow coral communities within the no-take marine reserve (NTMR) of Apo Island, which led to declines in fish populations that had built up over three decades. We found that hard coral cover was restricted to < 40 m deep in the storm-impacted NTMR and a nearby fished area not impacted by storms. Benthic cover at mesophotic depths (> 30 m) was dominated by sand/rubble and rock (dead coral) with low cover of soft corals, sponges and macroalgae. Storm damage appeared to have reached the deepest limit of the fringing reef (40 m) and reduced variability in benthic structure within the NTMR. Species richness and/or abundance of most trophic groups of fish declined with increasing depth regardless of storm damage. There were differences in taxonomic and trophic structure and degree of targeting by fisheries between shallow and mesophotic fish assemblages. Threatened shark species and a fish species previously unreported in the Philippines were recorded at mesophotic depths. Our findings provide a first glimpse of the benthic and fish assemblage structure of Philippine coral reef ecosystems across a wide depth gradient. This work also underscores how a combination of limited coral reef development at mesophotic depths close to shallow reefs and severe habitat loss caused by storms would result in minimal depth refuge for reef fish populations.","[Abesamis, Rene A.; Russ, Garry R.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Abesamis, Rene A.; Bucol, Abner A.] Silliman Univ, Angelo King Ctr Res & Environm Management, Dumaguete 6200, Negros, Philippines; [Langlois, Tim; Birt, Matthew; Thillainath, Emma] Univ Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Langlois, Tim; Birt, Matthew; Thillainath, Emma] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Arceo, Hazel O.] Univ Philippines Diliman, Inst Marine Sci, Quezon City 1101, Philippines",2,10.1007/s00338-017-1635-0,2018

To investigate how sounds produced on a given reef relate to abiotic and biotic parameters and how that relationship may change over time, an observational study was conducted between September 2014 and January 2016 at seven Hawaiian reefs that varied in coral cover, rugosity, and fish assemblages. The reefs were equipped with temperature loggers and acoustic recording devices that recorded on a 10% duty cycle. Benthic and fish visual survey data were collected four times over the course of the study. On average, reefs ranged from 0 to 80% live coral cover, although changes between surveys were noted, in particular during the major El Nio-related bleaching event of October 2015. Acoustic analyses focused on two frequency bands (50-1200 and 1.8-20.5 kHz) that corresponded to the dominant spectral features of the major sound-producing taxa on these reefs, fish, and snapping shrimp, respectively. In the low-frequency band, the presence of humpback whales (December-May) was a major contributor to sound level, whereas in the high-frequency band sound level closely tracked water temperature. On shorter timescales, the magnitude of the diel trend in sound production was greater than that of the lunar trend, but both varied in strength among reefs, which may reflect differences in the species assemblages present. Results indicated that the magnitude of the diel trend was related to fish densities at low frequencies and coral cover at high frequencies; however, the strength of these relationships varied by season. Thus, long-term acoustic recordings capture the substantial acoustic variability present in coral-reef ecosystems and provide insight into the presence and relative abundance of sound-producing organisms.","[Kaplan, Maxwell B.; Mooney, T.

In coral reef ecosystems, the differential susceptibility of coral taxa to climate-driven bleaching is predicted to shift coral assemblages towards reefs with an increased relative abundance of taxa with high thermal tolerance. Many thermally tolerant coral species are characterised by low structural complexity, with reduced habitat niche space for the small-bodied coral reef fishes on which piscivorous mesopredators feed. This study used a patch reef array to investigate the potential impacts of climate-driven shifts in coral assemblages on the trophodynamics of reef mesopredators and their prey communities. The 'tolerant' reef treatment consisted only of coral taxa of low susceptibility to bleaching, while 'vulnerable' reefs included species of moderate to high thermal vulnerability. 'Vulnerable' reefs had higher structural complexity, and the fish assemblages that established on these reefs over 18 months had higher species diversity, abundance and biomass than those on 'tolerant' reefs. Fish assemblages on 'tolerant' reefs were also more strongly influenced by the introduction of a mesopredator (Cephalopholis boenak). Mesopredators on 'tolerant' reefs had lower lipid content in their muscle tissue by the end of the 6-week experiment. Such sublethal energetic costs can compromise growth, fecundity, and survivorship, resulting in unexpected population declines in long-lived mesopredators. This study provides valuable insight into the altered trophodynamics of future coral reef ecosystems, highlighting the potentially increased vulnerability of reef fish assemblages to predation as reef structure declines, and the cost of changing prey availability on mesopredator condition.","[Hempson, Tessa N.; Graham, Nicholas A.

However, the vast majority of coral reproduction research has focused exclusively on shallow reefs. The incentive for the present study was: (1) the recent accelerated global degradation of coral reefs; (2) the growing interest in mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs; 30-120 m depth) and their potential to serve as a larval source for shallow reefs; and (3) the lack of information on MCE coral reproduction. Here, we compare the reproduction and ecology of the depth-generalist coral Paramontastraea peresi between shallow (5-10 m) and mesophotic (40-45 m) habitats in the Gulf of Eilat/Aqaba, Red Sea. Field surveys were conducted to assess the living cover, abundance, and size frequency distribution of P. peresi. Four to six colonies from each habitat were sampled monthly between April 2015 and January 2017, and the gametogenesis cycles, fecundity, and oocyte sizes were measured. The reproductive cycle in the MCEs was shorter than in the shallow reef. Despite having larger polyps, the mesophotic colonies contained significantly smaller and fewer oocytes per polyp. In spite of the relatively stable environmental conditions of the MCEs, which may contribute to coral survival, scarcity of sunlight is probably a major energetic impediment to investment in reproduction by P. peresi at mesophotic depths. Further intensive reproductive studies in mesophotic reefs are thus required to assess the ability of corals in this environment to reproduce and constitute a larval source for depleted shallow-water reefs.","[Feldman, Bar; Shlesinger, Tom; Loya, Yossi] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Zool, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",1,10.1007/s00338-017-1648-8,2018

Hypoxia may be a challenge for coral-reef fish that hide in the reef to avoid predators at night. Triggerfishes (Balistidae) are found in a variety of reef habitats, but they also are known to find refuge in reef crevices and holes at night, which may expose them to hypoxic conditions. The critical oxygen tension (P (crit)) was determined as the point below which oxygen uptake could not be maintained to support standard metabolic rate (SMR) for five species of triggerfish. The triggerfishes exhibited similar levels of hypoxia tolerance as other coral-reef and coastal marine fishes that encounter low oxygen levels in their environment. Two species, Rhinecanthus rectangulus and R. aculeatus, had the lowest P (crit) (similar to 3.0 kPa O-2), comparable to the most hypoxia-tolerant obligate coral-dwelling gobies, while Odonus niger and Sufflamen bursa were moderately tolerant to hypoxia (P (crit) similar to 4.5 kPa), and Xanthichthys auromarginatus was intermediate (P (crit) similar to 3.7 kPa). These differences in P (crit) were not due to differences in oxygen demand, as all the species had a similar SMR once mass differences were taken into account. The results suggest that triggerfish species are adapted for different levels of hypoxia exposure during nocturnal sheltering within the reef.","[Wong, Corrie C.; Korsmeyer, Keith E.] Hawaii Pacific Univ, Dept Nat Sci, 45-045 Kamehameha Hwy, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; [Drazen, Jeffrey C.] Univ Hawaii, Dept Oceanog, 1000 Pope Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Callan, Chatham K.] Hawaii Pacific Univ, Finfish Dept, Ocean Inst, 41-202 Kalanianaole Hwy, Waimanalo, HI 96795 USA",1,10.1007/s00338-017-1649-7,2018

The recent deterioration of reef health globally, including loss of coral cover, has resulted in significant declines in architectural complexity at a large, reef-scape scale. Interestingly, the fine-scale role of micro-structure in initiating and facilitating future reef development and calcium carbonate production has largely been overlooked. In this study, experimental substrates with and without micro-ridges were deployed in the lagoon at One Tree Island for 34 months. This study assessed how the presence or absence of micro-ridges promoted recruitment by key reef-building sclerobionts (corals and encrusters) and their subsequent development at micro (mm) and macro (cm) scales. Experimental plates were examined after 11 and 34 months to assess whether long-term successional and calcification processes on different micro-topographies led to convergent or divergent communities over time. Sclerobionts were most prevalent in micro-grooves when they were available. Interestingly, in shallow lagoon reef sites characterised by shoals of small parrotfish and low urchin abundance, flat substrates were also successfully recruited to. Mean rates of carbonate production were 374 +/- 154 (SD) g CaCO3 m(-2) yr(-1) within the lagoon. Substrates with micro-ridges were characterised by significantly greater rates of carbonate production than smooth substrates. The orientation of the substrate and period of immersion also significantly impacted rates of carbonate production, with CaCO3 on cryptic tiles increasing by 28% between 11 and 34 months. In contrast, rates on exposed tiles declined by 35% over the same time. In conclusion, even at sites characterised by small-sized parrotfish and low urchin density, micro-topography is an important settlement niche clearly favouring sclerobiont early life-history processes and subsequent carbonate production.","[Mallela, Jennie] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Mallela, Jennie] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",3,10.1007/s00338-017-1650-1,2018

As such, ecological surveys are beginning to focus on corals that live in high thermal stress environments to understand how future coral populations may adapt to climate change. We investigated the relationship between coral growth, thermal microhabitat, symbionts type, and thermal acclimatization of four species of the Acropora hyacinthus complex in back-reef lagoons in American Samoa. Coral growth was measured from August 2010 to April 2016 using horizontal planar area of coral colonies derived from photographs and in situ maximum width measurements. Despite marked intraspecific variation, we found that planar colony growth rates were significantly different among cryptic species. The highly heat tolerant A. hyacinthus variant ""HE"" increased in area an average of 2.9% month(-1) (0.03 cm average mean radial extension month(-1)). By contrast, the three less tolerant species averaged 6.1% (0.07 cm average mean radial extension month(-1)). Planar growth rates were 40% higher on average in corals harboring Clade C versus Clade D symbiont types, although marked inter-colony variation in growth rendered this difference nonsignificant. Planar growth rates for all four species dropped to near zero following a 2015 bleaching event, independent of the visually estimated percent area of bleaching.

Niche theory and neutral theory provide frameworks for testing assumptions and generating insights about the importance of local versus regional processes. Niche theory postulates that species assemblages are an outcome of evolutionary processes at regional scales followed by local-scale interactions, whereas neutral theory presumes that species assemblages are formed by largely random processes drawing from regional species pools. Indo-Pacific cryptobenthic coral-reef fishes are highly evolved, ecologically diverse, temporally responsive, and situated on a natural longitudinal diversity gradient, making them an ideal group for testing predictions from niche and neutral theories and effects of regional and local processes on species assemblages. Using a combination of ecological metrics (fish density, diversity, assemblage composition) and evolutionary analyses (testing for phylogenetic niche conservatism), we demonstrate that the structure of cryptobenthic fish assemblages can be explained by a mixture of regional factors, such as the size of regional species pools and broad-scale barriers to gene flow/drivers of speciation, coupled with local-scale factors, such as the relative abundance of specific microhabitat types. Furthermore, species of cryptobenthic fishes have distinct microhabitat associations that drive significant differences in assemblage community structure between microhabitat types, and these distinct microhabitat associations are phylogenetically conserved over evolutionary timescales. The implied differential fitness of cryptobenthic fishes across varied microhabitats and the conserved nature of their ecology are consistent with predictions from niche theory. Neutral theory predictions may still hold true for early life-history stages, where stochastic factors may be more important in explaining recruitment. Overall, through integration of ecological and evolutionary techniques, and using multiple spatial scales, our study offers a unique perspective on factors determining coral-reef fish assemblages.","[Ahmadia, Gabby N.] World Wildlife Fund, Oceans Conservat, 1250 24th St NW, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Ahmadia, Gabby N.; Tornabene, Luke; Pezold, Frank L.] Texas A&M Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, 6300 Ocean Dr, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA; [Tornabene, Luke] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, 1122 NE Boat St, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Tornabene, Luke] Burke Museum Nat Hist & Culture, 17th Ave NE & NE 45th St, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Smith, David J.] Univ Essex, Sch Biol Sci, Coral Reef Res Unit, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",3,10.1007/s00338-018-1657-2,2018

Corals in the southern Persian Gulf already experience extreme temperature ranges (<20 to >34 degrees C), chronic hypersalinity (>43 psu) and frequent light limitation (<100 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)). We compared annual rates of calcification for two of the most common coral species in the region (Platygyra daedalea and Cyphastrea microphthalma) along marked gradients in environmental conditions in the southern Persian Gulf and into the Oman Sea. Overall calcification rates were 32% higher in P. daedalea colonies ((x) over bar= 1.103 g cm(-2) y(-1), n = 46) than in C. microphthalma ((x) over bar= 0.835 g cm(-2) y(-1), n = 37), probably reflecting inter-specific differences in energy allocation and skeletal density. There was also considerable variation in calcification rates among individual colonies from the same locations that was unrelated to depth or photosymbiont type. However, most interestingly, P daedalea and C. microphthalma exhibited contrasting trends in mean annual calcification rates across locations. For P daedalea, calcification rates were lowest at Delma, where the minimum temperatures were lowest and salinity was highest, and increased across the southern Persian Gulf with increases in minimum temperatures and decreases in salinity. These data suggest that calcification rates of P daedalea are most constrained by minimum temperatures, which is consistent with the strong relationship between annual calcification rates and minimum local temperatures recorded across the Indo-Pacific. Conversely, linear extension and calcification of C. microphthalma in the southern Persian Gulf was lowest at Ras Ghanada, where there was lowest light and highest maximum temperatures. These data reveal striking taxonomic differences in the specific environmental constraints on coral calcification, which will further reinforce changes in the structure of coral assemblages with ongoing global climate change.","[Howells, Emily J.; McParland, Dain; Vaughan, Grace O.; Burt, John A.] New York Univ Abu Dhabi, Ctr Genom & Syst Biol, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Dunshea, Glenn] Ecol Marine Serv, Millbank, Qld, Australia; [Dunshea, Glenn] Univ Copenhagen, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Heroe, Scott F.] NOAA, NESDIS, STAR Coral Reef Watch, College Pk, MD USA; [Heroe, Scott F.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Phys Dept, Marine Geophys Lab, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Pratchett, Morgan S.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Bauman, Andrew G.] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, Expt Marine Ecol Lab, Singapore, Singapore",1,10.3389/fmars.2018.00056,2018

However, the link between perception of baseline states and support for conservation planning has not been tested empirically. Here, we investigate how perceptions of change in coral reef ecosystems affect stakeholders' willingness to pay (WTP) for the establishment of protected areas. Coral reefs are experiencing rapid, global change that is observable by the public, and therefore provide an ideal ecosystem to test links between beliefs about baseline states and willingness to support conservation. Our survey respondents perceived change to coral reef communities across six variables: coral abundance, fish abundance, fish diversity, fish size, sedimentation, and water pollution. Respondants who accurately perceived declines in reef health had significantly higher WTP for protected areas (US $256.80 vs. $102.50 per year), suggesting that shifted baselines may reduce engagement with conservation efforts. If WTP translates to engagement, this suggests that goals for restoration and recovery are likely to be more ambitious if the public is aware of long term change. Therefore, communicating the scope and depth of environmental problems is essential in engaging the public in conservation.","[McClenachan, Loren] Colby Coll, Environm Studies Program, Waterville, ME 04901 USA; [Matsuura, Ryunosuke; Dissanayake, Sahan T.

Intensive, size-specific fishing mortality induces directional shifts in phe-notypic frequencies towards the predominance of smaller and earlier-maturing individuals, which are among the primary causes of declining fish biomass. Fish that reproduce at smaller size and younger age produce fewer, smaller, and less viable larvae, severely reducing the reproductive capacity of harvested populations. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are extensively utilized in coral reefs for fisheries management, and are thought to mitigate the impacts of size-selective fishing mortality and supplement fished stocks through larval export. However, empirical evidence of disparities in fitness-relevant phenotypes between MPAs and adjacent fished reefs is necessary to validate this assertion. Here, we compare key life-history traits in three coral-reef fishes (Acanthurus nigrofuscus, Cteno-chaetus striatus, and Parupeneus multifasciatus) between MPAs and fished reefs in the Philippines. Results of our analyses support previous hypotheses regarding the impacts of MPAs on phenotypic traits. Asymptotic length (L-inf) and growth rates (K) differed between conspecifics in MPAs and fished reefs, with protected populations exhibiting phenotypes that are known to confer higher fecundity. Additionally, populations demonstrated increases in length at 50% maturity (L-50) inside MPAs compared to adjacent areas, although age at 50% maturity (A(50)) did not appear to be impacted by MPA establishment. Shifts toward advantageous phenotypes were most common in the oldest and largest MPAs, but occurred in all of the MPAs examined. These results suggest that MPAs may provide protection against the impacts of size-selective harvest on life-history traits in coral-reef fishes.","[Fidler, Robert Y.; Matthews, Danielle F.; Turingan, Ralph G.] Florida Inst Technol, Dept Biol Sci, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA; [Carroll, Jessica; Rynerson, Kristen W.] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, St Petersburg, FL USA",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0193426,2018

In this study, we analyzed microsatellite genotypes, mitochondrial lineages, and morphometric data from 373 S. fuscescens individuals sampled from the northern Philippines and Hong Kong (South China Sea, Philippine Sea and Sulu Sea basins), to examine putative species boundaries in samples comprising three co-occurring mitochondrial lineages previously reported to characterize S. fuscescens (Clade A and Clade B) or S. canaliculatus (Clade C). We report the existence of two cryptic species within S. fuscescens in the northeast region of the South China Sea and northern Philippine Sea, supported by genetic and morphological differences. Individual-based assignment methods recovered concordant groupings of individuals into two nuclear genotype clusters (Cluster 1, Cluster 2) with (1) limited gene flow, if any, between them (F-ST = 0.241; P < 0.001); (2) low frequency of later-generation hybrids; (3) significant association with mitochondrial Clade A and Clade B, respectively; and (4) subtle yet significant body shape differences as inferred from geometric morphometric analysis. The divergence between mitochondrial Clade C and the two other clades was not matched by genetic differences at microsatellite marker loci. The occurrence of discordant mitonuclear combinations (20.5% of the total number of individuals) is thought to result from mitochondrial introgression, consistent with a scenario of demographic, and presumably spatial, post-Pleistocene expansion of populations from northern regions into a secondary contact zone in the South China Sea. Mitonuclear discordance due to introgression obscures phylogenetic relationships for recently-diverged lineages, and cautions against the use of mitochondrial markers alone for species identification within the mottled rabbitfish species complex in the South China Sea region.","[Ravago-Gotanco, Rachel; Lorena de la Cruz, Talna; Josefa Pante, Ma.] Univ Philippines, Inst Marine Sci, Quezon City, Philippines; [Borsa, Philippe] Univ Udayana, Indonesian Biodivers Res Ctr, Ecol Marine Trop Oceans Pacifique & Indien, IRD, Denpasar, Indonesia",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0193220,2018

For this purpose, we developed a novel method for simultaneous monitoring of Acropora corals and their symbiont, Symbiodinium, from environmental DNA (eDNA) in seawater using next generation sequencing technology (NGS). We performed a tank experiment with running seawater using 19 Acropora species. Complete mitochondrial genomes of all the Acropora species were assembled to create a database and major types of their Symbiodinium symbionts were identified. Then eDNA was isolated by filtering inlet and outlet seawater from the tanks. Acropora and Symbiodinium DNA were amplified by PCR and sequenced. We detected all of the tested Acropora types from eDNA samples. Proportions and numbers of DNA sequences were both positively correlated with masses of corals in the tanks. In this trial, we detected DNA sequences from as little as 0.04 kg of Acropora colony, suggesting that existence of at least one adult Acropora colony (similar to 30 cm diameter = 1 kg) per m(2) at depths < 10 m could be detected using eDNA in the field. In addition, we detected major types of Symbiodinium within host corals from seawater, suggesting that it should be possible to detect major coral symbiont types if Acropora corals exist nearby, and possible free-living state Symbiodinium cells from eDNA in seawater. eDNA abundance of Symbiodinium types did not correlate well with frequencies of major Symbiodinium types in the corals, suggesting that quantification of Symbiodinium is difficult at this stage. Although this is the initial attempt to detect coral and Symbiodinium simultaneously from eDNA in seawater, this method may allow us to perform high-frequency, high-density coral reef monitoring of both corals and their symbionts in the near future.","[Shinzato, Chuya] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Chiba, Japan; [Shinzato, Chuya; Zayasu, Yuna; Satoh, Noriyuki] Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol Grad Univ, Marine Genom Unit, Onna, Okinawa, Japan; [Kanda, Miyuki; Kawamitsu, Mayumi] Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol Grad Univ, DNA Sequence Sect SOC, Onna, Okinawa, Japan; [Yamashita, Hiroshi; Suzuki, Go] Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Seikai Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Res Ctr Subtrop Fisheries, Ishigaki, Okinawa, Japan",1,10.3389/fmars.2018.00028,2018

However, while theory predicts that coral calcification rates decline as carbonate ion concentrations decrease, this prediction is not consistently borne out in laboratory manipulation experiments or in studies of corals inhabiting naturally low-pH reefs today. The skeletal growth of corals consists of two distinct processes: extension (upward growth) and densification (lateral thickening). Here, we show that skeletal density is directly sensitive to changes in seawater carbonate ion concentration and thus, to OA, whereas extension is not. We present a numerical model of Porites skeletal growth that links skeletal density with the external seawater environment via its influence on the chemistry of coral calcifying fluid. We validate the model using existing coral skeletal datasets from six Porites species collected across five reef sites and use this framework to project the impact of 21st century OA on Porites skeletal density across the global tropics.

In the parrotfish Chlorurus bleekeri, a roving consumer, the range of delta N-15 and delta C-13 and their niche area displayed significant relationships with the amount of rubble in the habitat. In contrast, the farming damselfish, Dischistodus prosopotaenia, showed a narrow range of both delta N-15 and delta C-13, displaying little change in niche parameters among sites. This may indicate that parrotfish vary their feeding according to habitat, while the damselfish continue to maintain their turf and invertebrate resources. Assessing isotopic niches may help to better understand the specific trophic responses to change in the environment. Furthermore, the use of isotopic niches underlines the utility of stable isotopes in studying the potential impacts of environmental change on feeding ecology.","[Plass-Johnson, Jeremiah G.; Bednarz, Vanessa N.; Ferse, Sebastian C.

The reefs in this area are exposed to a high level of anthropogenic disturbances. Previous studies have shown that variation in the benthos is strongly linked to water quality and distance from the mainland. However, little is known about the fish assemblages of the region and if their community structure also follows a relationship with benthic structure and distance from shore. In this study, we used eight islands of the archipelago, varying in distance from 1 to 55 km relative to the mainland, and 3 years of surveys, to describe benthic and fish assemblages and to examine the spatial and temporal influence of benthic composition on the structure of the fish assemblages. Cluster analysis indicated that distinct groups of fish were associated with distance, while few species were present across the entire range of sites. Relating fish communities to benthic composition using a multivariate generalized linear model confirmed that fish groups relate to structural complexity (rugosity) or differing benthic groups; either algae, reef builders (coral and crustose coralline algae) or invertebrates and rubble. From these relationships we can identify sets of fish species that may be lost given continued degradation of the Spermonde reefs. Lastly, the incorporation of water quality, benthic and fish indices indicates that local coral reefs responded positively after an acute disturbance in 2013 with increases in reef builders and fish diversity over relatively short (1 year) time frames. This study contributes an important, missing component (fish community structure) to the growing literature on the Spermonde Archipelago, a system that features environmental pressures common in the greater Southeast Asian region.","[Plass-Johnson, Jeremiah G.; Teichberg, Mirta; Bednarz, Vanessa N.; Heiden, Jasmin P.; Minarro, Sara; Weiand, Laura; Ferse, Sebastian C.

To determine the main environmental drivers of coral reef status in the Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia, we monitored environmental variables and coral reef benthic community structure along an on-to-offshore gradient annually from 2012 to 2014. Findings revealed that concentrations of phosphate, chlorophyll a-like fluorescence, suspended particulate matter, and light attenuation significantly decreased from on-to-offshore, while concentrations of dissolved O-2 and values of water pH significantly increased on-to-offshore. Nitrogen stable isotope signatures of sediment and an exemplary common brown alga were significantly enriched nearshore, identifying wastewater input from the city of Makassar as primary N source. In contrast to the high temporal variability in water quality, coral reef benthic community cover did not show strong temporal, but rather, spatial patterns. Turf algae was the dominant group next to live coral, and was negatively correlated to live coral, crustose coralline algae (CCA), rubble and hard substrate. Variation in benthic cover along the gradient was explained by water quality variables linked to trophic status and physico-chemical variables. As an integrated measure of reef status and structural complexity, the benthic index, based on the ratio of relative cover of live coral and CCA to other coral reef organisms, and reef rugosity were determined. The benthic index was consistently low nearshore and increased offshore, with high variability in the midshelf sites across years. Reef rugosity was also lowest nearshore and increased further offshore. Both indices dropped in 2013, increasing again in 2014, indicating a period of acute disturbance and recovery within the study and suggesting that the mid-shelf reefs are more resilient to disturbance than nearshore reefs. We thus recommend using these two indices with a selected number of environmental variables as an integral part of future reef monitoring.","[Teichberg, Mirta; Bednarz, Vanessa N.; Kegler, Hauke F.; Gaerdes, Astrid A.; Heideni, Jasmin P.; Weiand, Laura; Mitiarror, Sara; Ferse, Sebastian C.

Surveys have identified over 150 coral reef fish species recruiting to temperate reefs at latitudes of 34 degrees S (Sydney) and 60 species to 37 degrees S (Merimbula) with 20 and 5 species respectively overwintering in at least 1 year over the study duration. We developed indices of vulnerability of key species to drops in water temperatures, by relating drops in abundances of species to temperature drops. Twenty species were ranked according to their temperature vulnerability. Overall, the families Chaetodontidae (butterflyfishes), Acanthuridae (surgeonfishes), Labridae (wrasses) and Pomacetnridae (damselfishes) had similar cold-water tolerance. However, there was considerable variability within families, for instance in the Pomacentridae, species from the genus Abudefduf appeared to have better cold-temperature tolerance than the other species. Predicted minimum overwintering temperature varied from 15.6 degrees C to 19.8-degrees C, with some species showing lower Tzero at Merimbula, the more poleward location. There was general concordance between a species' tolerance to cold-water and its tendency to occur as an overwinter but also notable exceptions. So while this work demonstrates the potential utility of tolerance to seasonal temperature drops as a means to predict range expansion capacity of vagrant species, the exceptional cases serve to highlight alternative factors. Specifically, tolerance to seasonal cooling of water is not the only important factor when predicting the range expansion capacity of a species. Factors affecting the general abundance of the vagrants, such as habitat suitability and competitor/predator environments will also be critical where overwinter survival becomes a lottery.","[Booth, David J.; Beretta, Giglia A.; Brown, Luke] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Sci, Fish Ecol Lab, Ultimo, NSW, Australia; [Figueira, Will F.] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia",1,10.3389/fmars.2018.00031,2018

A total of 11 691 specimens were collected, which belonged to 24 species and 15 families. Six perciform species constituted 93% of the total sample. Pseudogobius javanicus (53.29%) was the dominant species from August to November, Omobranchus elegans (28.49%) from April to July, non-identified species in December and January, and Liza carinata in February and March. A number of commercially important fish species were also identified. Abundance was the highest in summer/early autumn (max 162.4 in Sep), and lowest in winter/early spring (Mar = 4.5). Diversity (H') and richness (D-ma) indices (both max. in May: 1.67 and 1.95 respectively) were generally positively correlated with tide and temperature, and negatively with salinity. Seasonal variations play a more important role in the fish assemblage structure than tidal rhythm, with differences particularly pronounced between colder and warmer months. Despite the prominent seasonal differences in abiotic factors, this study indicates that Maowei mangroves provide habitat and food for juvenile fish throughout the year and thus are indispensable for the fish diversity in the Beibu Gulf.","[Wu, Zhi-Qiang; Zou, Qi; Chang, Tao; Huang, Liang-Liang] Guilin Univ Technol, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Guilin, Guangxi Provinc, Peoples R China; [Wu, Zhi-Qiang] Guangxi Univ, Nanning, Guangxi Provinc, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Dong] Qinzhou Marine Adm, Qinzhou, Guangxi Provinc, Peoples R China",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0192426,2018

Although many coral species are restricted to shallow depths, several species occur across large depth ranges, including lower mesophotic depths. Yet, it remains unclear how such species can persist under extreme low-light conditions and how the different symbiotic partners associated with these corals contribute to facilitate such broad depth ranges. We assessed holobiont genetic diversity of the Caribbean coral Agaricia undata over depth in three localities of Colombia: San Andres Island (between 37 and 85 m), Cartagena (between 17 and 45 m) and ""Parque Nacional Natural Corales de Profundidad"" (between 77 and 87 m). We used a population genomics approach (NextRAD) for the coral host, and amplicon sequencing for the associated Symbiodinium (non-coding region of the plastid psbA minicircle) and prokaryotic (V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene) symbiont community. For the coral host, genetic structuring was only observed across geographic regions, but not between depths. Bayesian clustering and discriminant analysis of principal components revealed genetic structuring between the three regions, but not between shallow (<30 m), upper (>= 30 and <= 60 m) and lower mesophotic (>60 m) depths. This pattern was confirmed when evaluating pairwise differentiation (F-ST) between populations, with much higher values between regions (0.0467-0.1034) compared to between depths [within location; -0.0075-(-0.0007)]. Symbiotic partners, including seven types of zooxanthellae and 325 prokaryotic OTUs, did not exhibit partitioning across depths. All samples hosted Symbiodinium Glade C3 and the type C3psbA_e was present in all depths. Alpha microbial diversity was not significantly different between zones (upper vs. lower), which community composition between coral colonies was similar in the two zones (ANOSIM, R = -0.079, P > 0.05). The coral microbiome was dominated by Uncultured Betaproteobacteria in the order EC94 (16%), Unknown-Bacteria (15%), family Cenarchaeaceae (12 %), Burkholderiaceae (10%), and Hahellaceae (10%). The constant coral-holobiont composition along the studied depth range suggests that identity of the symbionts is not responsible for the coral's broad depth range and adaptation to low light environments.","[Gonzalez-Zapata, Fanny L.; Ramirez-Portilla, Catalina; Reyes, Alejandro; Sanchez, Juan A.] Univ los Andes, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ciencias Biol, Bogota, Colombia; [Bongaerts, Pim] Univ Queensland, Global Change Inst, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Bongaerts, Pim] Calif Acad Sci, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA; [Ramirez-Portilla, Catalina] Justus Liebig Univ, Dept Anim Ecol & Systemat, Spezielle Zool & Biodiversitatsforsch, Giessen, Germany; [Adu-Oppong, Boahemaa; Walljasper, Gretchen; Reyes, Alejandro] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Genome Sci & Syst Biol, St Louis, MO USA; [Reyes, Alejandro] Univ los Andes, Max Planck Tandem Grp Computat Biol, Bogota, Colombia",4,10.3389/fmars.2018.00029,2018

As an isolated region and one of the country's poorest, coastal communities rely on fishing as a main source of animal protein and income. In an attempt to reverse declining trends of fisheries resources, in 2008, an Exclusive Zone of Artisanal Fishing closed to industrial fishing, was established by stakeholders in the Northern Choco region. Here we present a case study to investigate the effects of this area-based management on fisheries productivity and catch composition. Fishery landings data from 2010 to 2013 are compared to those of a neighbouring region with no fisheries management. Catch per unit effort, mean weight landed, and number of landed individuals were calculated for mangrove and non-mangrove associated species by boat type and fishing gear. A set of mixed effects models were used to unpack the effects of multiple factors and their interactions on response variables. Results show that across fishing gears and time, mean catch per unit effort increased by 50% in the Exclusive Zone of Artisanal Fishing within 3 years. Fisheries here focused on offshore resources with 61% more fishing trips associated with motorised boats than in the unmanaged region, where fishing was predominantly in mangroves and close to the coast. This suggests that fisheries management may have played a role in reducing pressure on mangrove resources. However, area-based management may have also driven the displacement of fishing effort by excluding industrial trawlers, which then concentrated their activity in neighbouring areas.","[Lopez-Angarita, Juliana; Hawkins, Julie P.; Roberts, Callum M.] Univ York, Environm Dept, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Lopez-Angarita, Juliana; Tilley, Alexander] Fdn Talking Oceans, Bogota, Colombia; [Tilley, Alexander] WorldFish, Dili, Timor-Leste; [Diaz, Juan M.] Fdn Marviva, Bogota, Colombia; [Diaz, Juan M.] Univ Nacl Colombia, Dept Geog, Bogota, Colombia; [Cague, E.

Photoprotection is therefore a vital part of coral stress physiology. Corals produce a variety of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-like proteins, some of which screen the symbiotic algae from excess sun light. Different tissue concentrations of these GFP-Iike proteins distinguish color morphs that are characteristic for many coral species. The question arises whether these pigmentation differences may diversify the niches that can be occupied by corals along the steep light gradient that structures coral reef communities. We assessed the implications of GFP-Iike protein expression in two color morphs of the symbiotic coral Hydnophora grandis, both associated with the same Symbiodinium sp. (subclade C40). The color morphs of this species (high fluorescent, HF; and low fluorescent, LF), characterized by markedly different contents of a cyan fluorescent protein, were exposed to different quantities of blue light (470 nm) that matched the major absorption band of the host pigment (473 nm). High intensities of blue light caused less photodamage to the symbiotic algae of the HF morph and resulted in higher growth rates of these corals compared to representatives of the LF morph. In contrast, under low intensities of blue light, the HF morph showed lower growth rates than the LF morph, indicating that trade-offs are associated with high levels of fluorescent protein expression under this condition. Both morphs showed highest growth rates at medium light intensities with no obvious influence of the tissue pigmentation. Reef coral color polymorphism caused by photoprotective GFP-Iike proteins may therefore be a product of balancing selection in which high pigment contents may be beneficial at the upper and detrimental at the lower end of the depth distribution range of symbiotic corals. Conversely, color morphs with GFP-Iike proteins that function to optimize symbiont photosynthesis in low light environments could gain an advantage from the benefits offered by high pigment levels in deeper waters.","[Quick, Cathryn; D'Angelo, Cecilia; Wiedenmann, Jorg] Univ Southampton, Ocean & Earth Sci, Coral Reef Lab, Southampton, Hants, England; [D'Angelo, Cecilia; Wiedenmann, Jorg] Univ Southampton, Inst Life Sci, Southampton, Hants, England",0,10.3389/fmars.2018.00011,2018

Despite reports of extensive coral bleaching and up to 97% coral mortality induced by El Nino events, a quantitative synthesis of the nature, intensity, and drivers of El Nino and La Nina impacts on corals is lacking. Herein, we first present a global meta-analysis of studies quantifying the effects of El Nino/La Nina-warming on corals, surveying studies from both the primary literature and International Coral Reef Symposium (ICRS) Proceedings. Overall, the strongest signal for El Nino/La Nina-associated coral bleaching was long-term mean temperature; bleaching decreased with decreasing long-term mean temperature (n = 20 studies). Additionally, coral cover losses during El Nino/La Nina were shaped by localized maximum heat stress and long-term mean temperature (n = 28 studies). Second, we present a method for quantifying coral heat stress which, for any coral reef location in the world, allows extraction of remotely-sensed degree heating weeks (DHW) for any date (since 1982), quantification of the maximum DHW, and the time lag since the maximum DHW. Using this method, we show that the 2015/16 El Nino event instigated unprecedented global coral heat stress across the world's oceans. With El Nino events expected to increase in frequency and severity this century, it is imperative that we gain a clear understanding of how these thermal stress anomalies impact different coral species and coral reef regions. We therefore finish with recommendations for future coral bleaching studies that will foster improved syntheses, as well as predictive and adaptive capacity to extreme warming events.","[Claar, Danielle C.; Szostek, Lisa; McDevitt-Irwin, Jamie M.; Baum, Julia K.] Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Schanze, Julian J.] Earth & Space Res, Seattle, WA USA",2,10.1371/journal.pone.0190957,2018

Social-ecological vulnerability assessments are highly relevant for place-based management and can help target and prioritize management actions. However, an understanding of how linked social-ecological vulnerabilities respond to external drivers is still lacking. This paper presents an approach that integrates the spatial and temporal dimensions into social-ecological vulnerability assessments, where social and ecological vulnerabilities are linked by a feedback loop. The approach is applied to the Moorea coral reef social-ecological system, which has been significantly influenced by major environmental and social drivers over the last decade. Temporal changes in linked social-ecological vulnerabilities are mapped before and after exposure to the multiple drivers. Nearly 23% of households and 13% of the reef area show low and decreasing vulnerability despite exposure. However, high and increasing levels of vulnerability were detected in 6% of households and associated reefs after exposure to the drivers, providing early warnings of potentially unsustainable situations. Importantly, changes in ecological vulnerability did not propagate linearly to changes in social vulnerability. Similarly, hot spots of social vulnerability were not necessarily associated with hot spots of ecological vulnerability, highlighting the need to specifically adapt management interventions to local social-ecological settings. Mapping social-ecological dependencies in space and time provides communities and decision-makers with the information required to identify and prioritize management interventions while accounting for the effects of large-scale or external drivers.","[Thiault, Laurie; Marshall, Paul; Claudet, Joachim] PSL Res Univ, CRIOBE, USR3278, Natl Ctr Sci Res,CNRS EPHE UPVD, Perpignan, France; [Thiault, Laurie; Collin, Antoine; Claudet, Joachim] Lab Excellence CORAIL, Perpignan, France; [Thiault, Laurie; Chlous, Frederique] Museum Natl Hist Nat, MNHN IRD, UMR208, PALOC, F-75231 Paris, France; [Thiault, Laurie; Gelcich, Stefan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias, Ctr Appl Ecol & Sustainabil CAPES, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile; [Thiault, Laurie; Gelcich, Stefan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Conservac Marina, Fac Ciencias, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile; [Marshall, Paul] Reef Ecol, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Marshall, Paul] Univ Queensland, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat Res, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Chlous, Frederique] EPHE, Dept Life & Earth Sci, F-35800 Dinard, France",1,10.1016/j.marpol.2017.11.027,2018

We explore the potential to make reliable climate predictions over time scales of six months to 10 years for use by policy makers, managers and communities.

The effects of ocean warming and acidification on coral reefs, and the effects of climate change on mangrove and seagrass habitats, are expected to widen this gap. To optimise the contributions of small-scale fisheries to food security in PICTs, adaptations are needed to minimise and fill the gap. Key measures to minimise the gap include community-based approaches to: manage catchment vegetation to reduce sedimentation; maintain the structural complexity of fish habitats; allow landward migration of mangroves as sea level rises; sustain recruitment and production of demersal fish by managing 'source' populations; and diversify fishing methods to increase catches of species favoured by climate change. The main adaptions to help fill the gap in fish supply include: transferring some fishing effort from coral reefs to tuna and other large pelagic fish by scaling-up the use of nearshore fish aggregating devices; developing fisheries for small pelagic species; and extending the shelf life of catches by improving post-harvest methods. Modelling the effects of climate change on the distribution of yellowfin tuna, skipjack tuna, wahoo and mahi mahi, indicates that these species are likely to remain abundant enough to implement these adaptations in most PICTs until 2050.

We investigated the effect of playback of boat noise on fish cognition. We focused on noise from small motorboats, since its occurrence can dominate soundscapes in coastal communities, the number of noise-producing vessels is increasing rapidly and their proximity to marine life has the potential to cause deleterious effects. Cognition-or the ability of individuals to learn and remember information-is crucial, given that most species rely on learning to achieve fitness-promoting tasks, such as finding food, choosing mates and recognizing predators. The caveat with cognition is its latent effect: the individual that fails to learn an important piece of information will live normally until the moment where it needs the information to make a fitness-related decision. Such latent effects can easily be overlooked by traditional risk assessment methods. Here, we conducted three experiments to assess the effect of boat noise playbacks on the ability of fish to learn to recognize predation threats, using a common, conserved learning paradigm. We found that fish that were trained to recognize a novel predator while being exposed to 'reef thorn boat noise' playbacks failed to subsequently respond to the predator, while their 'reef noise' counterparts responded appropriately. We repeated the training, giving the fish three opportunities to learn three common reef predators, and released the fish in the wild. Those trained in the presence of 'reef thorn boat noise' playbacks survived 40% less than the 'reef noise' controls over our 72 h monitoring period, a performance equal to that of predator-naive fish. Our last experiment indicated that these results were likely due to failed learning, as opposed to stress effects from the sound exposure. Neither playbacks nor real boat noise affected survival in the absence of predator training. Our results indicate that boat noise has the potential to cause latent effects on learning long after the stressor has gone.","[Ferrari, Maud C.

We assessed the short-term effects of CO2 on the light responses of the net community production (NCP) and community respiration (CR) of intertidal Z. noltei and unvegetated sediment communities of Ria Formosa lagoon, when exposed to air. NCP and CR were measured in situ in summer and winter, under present and CO2 enriched conditions using benthic chambers. Within chamber CO2 evolution measurements were carried out by a series of short-term incubations (30 min) using an infra-red gas analyser. Liner regression models fitted to the NCP-irradiance responses were used to estimate the seasonal budgets of air-exposed, intertidal production as determined by the daily and seasonal variation of incident photosynthetic active radiation. High CO2 resulted in higher CO2 sequestration by both communities in both summer and winter seasons. Lower respiration rates of both communities under high CO2 further contributed to a potential negative climate feedback, except in winter when the CR of sediment community was higher. The light compensation points (LCP) (light intensity where production equals respiration) of Z. noltei and sediment communities also decreased under CO2 enriched conditions in both seasons. The seasonal community production of Z. noltei was 115.54 +/- 7.58 g C m(-2) season(-1) in summer and 29.45 +/- 4.04 g C m(-2) season(-1) in winter and of unvegetated sediment was 91.28 +/- 6.32 g C m(-2) season(-1) in summer and 25.83 +/- 4.01 g C m(-2) season(-1) in winter under CO2 enriched conditions.

Whilst numerous relationships and feedback mechanisms between the functional roles of coral reef fishes and reef benthic composition have been investigated, certain key groups, such as the herbivores, are widely suggested to maintain reefs in a coral-dominated state. Examining links between fishes and reef benthos is complicated by the interactions between natural processes, disturbance events and anthropogenic impacts, particularly fishing pressure. This study examined fish assemblages and associated benthic variables across five atolls within the Chagos Archipelago, where fishing pressure is largely absent, to better understand these relationships. We found high variability in fish assemblages among atolls and sites across the archipelago, especially for key groups such as a suite of grazer-detritivore surgeonfish, and the parrotfishes which varied in density over 40-fold between sites. Differences in fish assemblages were significantly associated with variable levels of both live and recently dead coral cover and rugosity. We suggest these results reflect differing coral recovery trajectories following coral bleaching events and a strong influence of 'bottom-up' control mechanisms on fish assemblages. Species level analyses revealed that Scarus niger, Acanthurus nigrofuscus and Chlorurus strongylocephalos were key species driving differences in fish assemblage structure.

On coral reefs, herbivorous echinoids consume fleshy algae, facilitating the growth of reef-building calcified organisms; however, little is known about differences among species in their metabolic and functional ecology. Here, we used log-linear (log-log) regression models to examine the allometric scaling of mass and routine metabolic rate for five common herbivorous echinoids on a Hawaiian coral reef: Echinothrix calamaris, E. diadema, Echinometra matthaei, Hetero-centrotus mammillatus, and Tripneustes gratilla. Scaling relationships were then contrasted with empirical observations of echinoid ecology and general metabolic theory to broaden our understanding of diversity in the metabolic and functional ecology of tropical herbivorous echinoids. Results Test diameter and species explained 98% of the variation in mass, and mass and species explained 92.4% and 87.5% of the variation in individual (I) and mass-specific (B) metabolic rates, respectively. Scaling exponents did not differ for mass or metabolism; however, normalizing constants differed significantly among species. Mass varied as the cube of test diameter (b = 2.9), with HM exhibiting a significantly higher normalizing constant than other species, likely due to its heavily-calcified spines and skeleton. Individual metabolic rate varied approximately as the 2/5 power of mass (gamma = 0.44); significantly smaller than the 3/4 universal scaling coefficient, but inclusive of 2/3 scaling. E. calamaris and H. mammillatus exhibited the lowest normalizing constants, corresponding with their slow-moving, cryptic, rock-boring life-history. In contrast, E. calamaris, E. diadema, and T. gratilla, exhibited higher metabolic rates, likely reflecting their higher levels of activity and ability to freely browse for preferred algae due to chemical anti-predator defenses. Thus, differences in metabolic scaling appeared to correspond with differences in phylogeny, behavior, and ecological function. Such comparative metabolic assessments are central to informing theory, ecological models, and the effective management of ecosystems.","[Lewis, Levi S.; Smith, Jennifer E.; Eynaud, Yoan] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Ctr Marine Biodivers & Conservat, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Lewis, Levi S.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA",1,10.1371/journal.pone.0190470,2018

The survival is believed to be strongly determined by biological interactions and sea conditions, however it has been poorly investigated. We examined the settlement patterns related to relevant biotic and abiotic factors (i.e. Density-dependence, wind stress, wave height and coastal current velocity) potentially determining post-settler survival rates of a coastal necto-benthic fish of wide distribution in the Mediterranean and eastern Atlantic, the white seabream (Diplodus sargus). An observational study of the demography of juveniles of this species was carried out at six coves in Menorca Island (Balearic Islands, western Mediterranean). Three of the coves were located in the northern and wind exposed coast, at the Northeast (NE) side; while the other three were found along the southern and sheltered coast, at the Southwest (SW) side of the island. The settlement period extended from early May to late June and maximum juvenile densities at the sampling sites varied between 5 and 11 ind. m(-1) with maximum values observed in late May simultaneously occurring in the two coasts. Our analysis of juvenile survival, based on the interpretation of the observed patters using an individual based model (IBM), revealed two stages in the size-mortality relationships. An initial density-dependent stage was observed for juveniles up to 20 mm TL, followed by a density independent stage when other factors dominated the survival at sizes >20 mm TL. No significant environmental effects were observed for the small size class (<20mm TL). Different significant environmental effects affecting NE and SW coves were observed for the medium (20-30mm TL) and large (>30mm TL) size class. In the NE, the wind stress consistently affected the density of fish of 20 +/- 30 mm and >30 mm TL with a dome-shape effect with higher densities at intermediate values of wind stress and negative effect at the extremes. The best models applied in the SW coves showed a significant non-linear negative effect on fish density that was also consistent for both groups 20 +/- 30 mm and >30 mm TL. Higher densities were observed at low values of wave height in the two groups. Because of these variations, the number of juveniles present at the end of the period was unrelated to their initial density and average survival varied among locations. In consequence, recruitment was (1) primarily limited by denso-dependient procedures at settlement stage, and (2) by sea conditions at post-settlement, where extreme wave conditions depleted juveniles. Accordingly, regional hydrodynamic conditions during the settlement season produced significant impacts on the juvenile densities depending on their size and with contrasted effects in respectto cove orientation. The similar strength in larval supply between coves, in addition to the similar mean phenology for settlers in the north and south of the Island, suggests that all fish may come from the same parental reproductive pool. These factors should be taken into account when assessing relationships between settlers, recruits and adults of white seabream.","[Cuadros, Amalia] IEO, Estacio Invest Jaume Ferrer, Mao, Spain; [Cuadros, Amalia; Cheminee, Adrien] Univ Perpignan, CNRS, Ctr Format Rech Environm Mediterraneens CEFREM, UMR 5110, Via Domitia,Avenue P Alduy, Perpignan, France; [Cuadros, Amalia] Univ Murcia, Dept Ecol & Hydrol, Marine Ecol & Conservat Res Grp, Campus Espinardo, Murcia, Spain; [Basterretxea, Gotzon] Inst Mediterraneo Estudios Avanzados IMEDEA, Miguel Marques 21, Esporles, Mallorca, Spain; [Basterretxea, Gotzon] UIB CSIC, Miguel Marques 21, Esporles, Mallorca, Spain; [Cardona, Luis] Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Anim Biol, IRBio, Avinguda Diagonal, Barcelona, Spain; [Cheminee, Adrien] Septentrion Environm, Marseille, France; [Hidalgo, Manuel; Moranta, Joan] IEO, COB, Ecosyst Oceanog Grp GRECO, Moll Ponent S-N, Palma De Mallorca, Spain",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0190278,2018

Abundance estimation through UVC is particularly problematic in species occurring at low densities and/or highly aggregated because of their high variability at both spatial and temporal scales. The statistical power of experiments involving UVC techniques may be increased by augmenting the number of replicates or the area surveyed. In this work we present and test the efficiency of an UVC method based on diver towed GPS, the Tracked Roaming Transect (TRT), designed to maximize transect length (and thus the surveyed area) with respect to diving time invested in monitoring, as compared to Conventional Strip Transects (CST). Additionally, we analyze the effect of increasing transect width and length on the precision of density estimates by comparing TRT vs. CST methods using different fixed widths of 6 and 20 m (FW3 and FW10, respectively) and the Distance Sampling (DS) method, in which perpendicular distance of each fish or group of fishes to the transect line is estimated by divers up to 20 m from the transect line. The TRT was 74% more time and cost efficient than the CST (all transect widths considered together) and, for a given time, the use of TRT and/or increasing the transect width increased the precision of density estimates. In addition, since with the DS method distances of fishes to the transect line have to be estimated, and not measured directly as in terrestrial environments, errors in estimations of perpendicular distances can seriously affect DS density estimations. To assess the occurrence of distance estimation errors and their dependence on the observer's experience, a field experiment using wooden fish models was performed. We tested the precision and accuracy of density estimators based on fixed widths and the DS method. The accuracy of the estimates was measured comparing the actual total abundance with those estimated by divers using FW3, FW10, and DS estimators. Density estimates differed by 13% (range 0.1-31%) from the actual values (average = 13.09%; median = 14.16%). Based on our results we encourage the use of the Tracked Roaming Transect with Distance Sampling (TRT+DS) method for improving density estimates of species occurring at low densities and/or highly aggregated, as well as for exploratory rapid-assessment surveys in which divers could gather spatial ecological and ecosystem information on large areas during UVC.","[Irigoyen, Alejo J.; Trobbiani, Gaston; Sanchez-Carnero, Noela] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CCT CENPAT CONICE, Ctr Estudio Sistemas Marinos CESIMAR, Blvd Brown, Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina; [Rojo, Irene; Garcia-Charton, Jose A.] Univ Murcia, Dept Ecol & Hidrol, Campus Espinardo, Murcia, Spain; [Calo, Antonio] Univ Cote dAzur, CNRS, FRE ECOMERS 3729, Parc Valrose, Nice, France",2,10.1371/journal.pone.0190990,2018

Herein, we determine the net calcification potential and the relative balance of net organic carbon metabolism (net community production; NCP) and net inorganic carbon metabolism (net community calcification; NCC) within 23 coral reef locations across the globe. In light of these results, we consider the suitability of using these two metrics developed from total alkalinity (TA) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) measurements collected on different spatiotemporal scales to monitor coral reef biogeochemistry under anthropogenic change. All reefs in this study were net calcifying for the majority of observations as inferred from alkalinity depletion relative to offshore, although occasional observations of net dissolution occurred at most locations. However, reefs with lower net calcification potential (i.e., lower TA depletion) could shift towards net dissolution sooner than reefs with a higher potential. The percent influence of organic carbon fluxes on total changes in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) (i.e., NCP compared to the sum of NCP and NCC) ranged from 32% to 88% and reflected inherent biogeochemical differences between reefs. Reefs with the largest relative percentage of NCP experienced the largest variability in seawater pH for a given change in DIC, which is directly related to the reefs ability to elevate or suppress local pH relative to the open ocean. This work highlights the value of measuring coral reef carbonate chemistry when evaluating their susceptibility to ongoing global environmental change and offers a baseline from which to guide future conservation efforts aimed at preserving these valuable ecosystems.","[Cyronak, Tyler; Andersson, Andreas J.; Kline, David I.; Page, Heather N.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Langdon, Chris] Univ Miami, Rosential Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL USA; [Albright, Rebecca; Caldeira, Ken] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA USA; [Bates, Nicholas R.] Bermuda Inst Ocean Sci, St Georges, Bermuda; [Bates, Nicholas R.] Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England; [Carlton, Renee; Enochs, Ian; Manzello, Derek] NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Carlton, Renee; Enochs, Ian] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Corredor, Jorge E.] Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Marine Sci, Mayaguez, PR 00709 USA; [Dunbar, Rob B.; Koweek, David A.; Teneva, Lida] Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Erez, Jonathan; Lazar, Boaz] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Earth Sci, Jerusalem, Israel; [Eyre, Bradley D.; Lantz, Coulson; Schulz, Kai G.] Southern Cross Univ, Ctr Coastal Biogeochem Res, Lismore, NSW, Australia; [Gattuso, Jean-Pierre] CNRS INSU, Lab Oceanog Villefranche, Villefranche Sur Mer, France; [Gattuso, Jean-Pierre] Univ Paris 06, UPMC, Sorbonne Univ, Observ Oceanolog, Villefranche Sur Mer, France; [Gattuso, Jean-Pierre] Inst Sustainable Dev & Int Relat, Paris, France; [Gledhill, Dwight] NOAA, Ocean Acidificat Program, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Kayanne, Hajime; Yamamoto, Shoji] Univ Tokyo, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Kline, David I.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Ancon, Panama; [McMahon, Ashly; Santos, Isaac R.] Southern Cross Univ, Natl Marine Sci Ctr, Coffs Harbour, NSW, Australia; [Melendez, Melissa] Univ New Hampshire, Sch Marine Sci & Ocean Engn, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Shaw, Emily] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; [Silverman, Jacob] Natl Inst Oceanog, Haifa, Israel; [Suzuki, Atsushi] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Geol Survey Japan, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Teneva, Lida] Conservat Int, Ctr Oceans, Honolulu, HI USA; [Watanabe, Atsushi] Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Mech & Environm Informat, Tokyo, Japan",6,10.1371/journal.pone.0190872,2018

The effects of temperature on metabolism are translated into organism performance depending on the organism size, morphology, and the flow regime to which they are exposed. Environmental forcing of metabolism is particularly germane to tropical reef corals, because they increasingly are exposed to upward temperature perturbations to which they display variable responses that remain incompletely understood. In this study, we tested the effects of colony size and seawater turbulence on the response of the common Indo-Pacific branching coral, Pocillopora verrucosa, to different seawater temperatures. Using whole-colony calcification as a response variable, 12 tanks (each 150 l) were used in two trials lasting 14 days to contrast the effects of seawater turbulence (two levels) and temperature (25.5 vs 29.5 degrees C) on colonies varying in size from similar to 4 to 13-cm diameter. Turbulence in the tanks was measured as the root mean square (rms) turbulent flow speed (q(rms)), which quantified the variation in speed of complex and non-linear flow, regardless of direction. Treatments contrasted low (q(rms) = 0.63 cm s(-1)) and high (q(rms) = 2.07 cm s(-1)) turbulence that were ecologically relevant for shallow coral reefs. The effects of turbulent flow speed and temperature on calcification (mg day(-1)) differed among colony sizes: at 25.5 degrees C, calcification increased with tissue surface area at a slower rate under high, compared to low turbulent flow speeds; at low turbulent flow speeds, calcification increased with tissue surface area more slowly at 29.5 versus 25.5 degrees C. These results show that the response of branching corals to temperatures depends on colony size and turbulent flow speed. This outcome suggests that spatial heterogeneity in turbulent flow regimes across a coral reef may provide opportunities for branching corals to exploit colony size to modulate susceptibility to rising temperature.","[Edmunds, Peter J.] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, 18111 Nordhoff St, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; [Burgess, Scott C.] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 319 Stadium Dr, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",2,10.1007/s00227-017-3257-z,2018

We tested the four models in the Pacific red snapper Lutjanus peru, a key commercial species in the Gulf of California (GC), Mexico. We genotyped 15 microsatellite loci in 225 samples collected during 20152016 from 8 sites, and contrasted the observed empirical genetic patterns against predictions from each model. We found low but significant levels of population structure among sites. Only the seascape approach was able to significantly explain levels of genetic structure and diversity, but exclusively within spring and summer, suggesting that this period represents the spawning season for L. peru. We showed that in the GC, the strong asymmetry in the oceanic currents causes larval connectivity to show different values when measured in distinct directions (anisotropy). Management tools, including marine reserves, could be more effective if placed upstream of the predominant flow. Managers should consider that oceanographic distances describing the direction and intensity of currents during the spawning period are significant predictors of larval connectivity between sites, as opposed to geographic distances.","[Munguia-Vega, Adrian] PANGAS Sci Coordinat Comunidad & Biodiversidad AC, Guaymas, Sonora, Mexico; [Munguia-Vega, Adrian] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Conservat Genet Lab, 1064 East Lowell St, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Guido Marinone, S.] Ctr Invest Cient & Educ Super Ensenada, Dept Oceanog Fis, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico; [Paz-Garcia, David A.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Marine Speciat & Mol Evolut Lab, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Paz-Garcia, David A.] Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Invest Biol Noroeste, Lab Necton & Ecol Arrecifes, 195 Col Playa Palo de Santa Rita Sur, La Paz, Baja California, Mexico; [Giron-Nava, Alfredo] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Marine Biol Res, Scripps Inst Oceanog, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Plomozo-Lugo, Tomas; Gonzalez-Cuellar, Ollin; Hudson Weaver, Amy] Soc Hist Nat Niparaja AC, La Paz, Baja California, Mexico; [Garcia-Rodriguez, Francisco J.] Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Interdisciplinario Ciencias Marinas, La Paz, Baja California, Mexico; [Reyes-Bonilla, Hector] Univ Autonoma Baja California Sur, Lab Sistemas Arrecifales, La Paz, Baja California, Mexico",3,10.1007/s00227-017-3267-x,2018

We tested the effects of coral reef degradation on the feeding plasticity of four reef fish species. We used isotopic niche sizes and mean delta N-15 and delta C-13 values of each species in two coral reefs that differed in benthic condition. The species chosen have contrasting feeding strategies; Chaetodon lunulatus (corallivore), Chrysiptera rollandi (zooplanktivore), Halichoeres melanurus (invertivore) and Zebrasoma velifer (herbivore). We predicted that the corallivore would have a lower mean delta N-15 value and a smaller isotopic niche size in the degraded reef, that the herbivore and the invertivore might have a larger isotopic niche size and/or a different mean delta C-13 value, whereas the zooplanktivore might be indifferent since the species is not linked to coral degradation. Some results matched our predictions; C. lunulatus had a smaller niche size on the degraded reef, but no difference in mean delta N-15 and delta C-13 values, and H. melanurus displayed an increase in niche size and a lower mean delta N-15 value on the degraded reef. Some other results were contrary to our predictions; whereas Z. velifer and C. rollandi had smaller mean delta C-13 values but no difference in niche size. Our findings suggest there may be feeding plasticity to maintain a similar diet despite contrasting habitat characteristics, with different amplitude depending on species.

Over the past decade, high survival coupled with fast growth of in situ nursery corals have allowed practitioners to create healthy and genotypically diverse nursery stocks. Currently, thousands of corals are propagated and outplanted onto degraded reefs on a yearly basis, representing a substantial increase in the abundance, biomass, and overall footprint of A. cervicornis. Here, we combined an extensive dataset collected by restoration practitioners to document early (1-2 yr) restoration success metrics in Florida and Puerto Rico, USA. By reporting region-specific data on the impacts of fragment collection on donor colonies, survivorship and productivity of nursery corals, and survivorship and productivity of outplanted corals during normal conditions, we provide the basis for a stop-light indicator framework for new or existing restoration programs to evaluate their performance. We show that current restoration methods are very effective, that no excess damage is caused to donor colonies, and that once outplanted, corals behave just as wild colonies. We also provide science-based benchmarks that can be used by programs to evaluate successes and challenges of their efforts, and to make modifications where needed. We propose that up to 10% of the biomass can be collected from healthy, large A. cervicornis donor colonies for nursery propagation. We also propose the following benchmarks for the first year of activities for A. cervicornis restoration: (1) > 75% live tissue cover on donor colonies; (2) > 80% survivorship of nursery corals; and (3) > 70% survivorship of outplanted corals. Finally, we report productivity means of 4.4 cm yr(-1) for nursery corals and 4.8 cm yr(-1) for outplants as a frame of reference for ranking performance within programs. Such benchmarks, and potential subsequent adaptive actions, are needed to fully assess the long-term success of coral restoration and species recovery programs.","[Schopmeyer, Stephanie A.; Lirman, Diego] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Bartels, Erich] Mote Marine Lab, Trop Res Lab, 24244 Overseas Highway, Summerland Key, FL 33042 USA; [Gilliam, David S.; Goergen, Elizabeth A.] Nova Southeastern Univ, Halmos Coll Nat Sci & Oceanog, 8000 N Ocean Dr, Dania, FL 33004 USA; [Griffin, Sean P.] NOAA Restorat Ctr, IM Syst Grp, 260 Guard Rd, Aguadilla, PR 00605 USA; [Johnson, Meaghan E.; Lustic, Caitlin] Nature Conservancy, Florida Keys Off, 127 Ind Rd,Suite D, Big Pine Key, FL 33043 USA; [Maxwell, Kerry] Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Florida Marine Res Inst, 2796 Overseas Highway,Suite 119, Marathon, FL 33050 USA",2,10.1007/s00338-017-1596-3,2017

We tested the hypothesis that CO2 influences the functional response of epilithic and endolithic turf assemblages to increasing temperature. Replicate carbonate plugs covered by turf were collected from the reef and exposed to ambient and high pCO(2) (1000 A mu atm) conditions for 3 weeks. Each pCO(2) treatment was replicated across six temperatures (24.0-31.5 A degrees C) that spanned the full seasonal temperature range on a fringing reef in Moorea, French Polynesia, and included one warming treatment (3 A degrees C above daily average temperatures). Temperature and CO2 enrichment had complex, and sometimes interactive, effects on turf metabolism and growth. Photosynthetic and respiration rates were enhanced by increasing temperature, with an interactive effect of CO2 enrichment. Photosynthetic rates were amplified by high CO2 in the warmest temperatures, while the increase in respiration rates with temperature were enhanced under ambient CO2. Epilithic turf growth rates were not affected by temperature, but increased in response to CO2 enrichment. We found that CO2 and temperature interactively affected the endolithic assemblage, with the highest growth rates under CO2 enrichment, but only at the warmest temperatures. These results demonstrate how OA may influence algal physiology and growth across a range of ecologically relevant temperatures, and indicate that the effects of CO2 enrichment on coral-reef turf assemblages can be temperature dependent. The complex effects of CO2 enrichment and temperature across a suite of algal responses illustrates the importance of incorporating multiple stressors into global change experiments.","[Johnson, Maggie D.; Smith, Jennifer E.] Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Marine Biodivers & Conservat, Scripps Inst Oceanog, 9500 Gilman Dr, San Diego, CA 92093 USA; [Johnson, Maggie D.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Apartado Balboa, Ancon 084303092, Panama; [Comeau, Steeve] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, 18111 Nordhoff St, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; [Comeau, Steeve; Lantz, Coulson A.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Environm, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Comeau, Steeve; Lantz, Coulson A.] Univ Western Australia, ARC Ctr Coral Reef Studies, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Lantz, Coulson A.] Southern Cross Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Mil Rd, Lismore, NSW 2480, Australia",3,10.1007/s00338-017-1597-2,2017

Homing behaviour in juvenile fishes is of interest because it will shape subsequent spatial distributions of adult fish communities. Comparing multiple species, families and functional groups allows us to distinguish between species-specific traits and more generalised, species-independent traits that may drive homing behaviour. Using displacement experiments of up to 150 m, we quantified homing behaviour of juvenile, newly recruited reef fishes of seven species in three families, including herbivorous parrotfishes and rabbitfishes, carnivorous wrasse and planktivorous damselfishes. All species showed the ability to home successfully, but success rates differed among species. Juvenile parrotfishes were the most successful (67% returning home), while return rates in the other species ranged from 10.5% (Siganus doliatus) to 28.9% (Coris batuensis). However, across all species body size appeared to be the main driver of homing success, rather than species-specific traits. With every cm increase in body size, odds of returning home almost tripled (170% increase) across all species. Interestingly, the probability of getting lost was not related to body size, which suggests that mortality was not a major driver of unsuccessful homing. Homing probability halved beyond displacement distances of 10 m and then remained stable. Higher likelihood of homing over short distances may suggest that different sensory cues are used to navigate. Overall, our results suggest that homing ability is a widespread trait among juvenile reef fishes. A 'sense of home' and site attachment appear to develop early during ontogeny, especially above taxon-specific size thresholds. Hence, spatial flexibility exists only in a brief window after settlement, with direct implications for subsequent patterns of connectivity and ecosystem function in adult reef fish populations.","[Streit, Robert P.; Bellwood, David R.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Marine Biol & Ecol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Streit, Robert P.; Bellwood, David R.] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",2,10.1007/s00338-017-1600-y,2017

While many studies have focused on the recent demise of these species, data from areas where Acropora spp. have continued to thrive are limited. Understanding the genetic diversity, recruitment, and temporal continuity of healthy populations of these threatened Acropora spp. and the hybrid they form (""Acropora prolifera"") may provide insights into the demographic processes governing them. We studied three reef sites with abundant A. cervicornis, A. palmata, and hybrid Acropora populations offshore of Ambergris Caye, Belize at Coral Gardens, Manatee Channel, and Rocky Point. Samples were collected from all three Acropora taxa. We used microsatellite markers to determine: (1) genotypic diversity; (2) dominant reproductive mode supporting local recruitment; (3) minimum and maximum genet age estimates for all three acroporids; and (4) the history of hybrid colonization at these sites. We found that Acropora populations were highly clonal with local recruitment primarily occurring through asexual fragmentation. We also estimated the ages of 10 Acropora genets using recent methodology based on somatic mutation rates from genetic data. Results indicate minimum ages of 62-409 yr for A. cervicornis, 187-561 yr for A. palmata, and 156-281 yr for the Acropora hybrids at these sites. Our data indicate that existing A. cervicornis, A. palmata, and Acropora hybrid genets persisted during the 1980s Caribbean-wide Acropora spp. collapse, suggesting that these sites have been a refuge for Caribbean Acropora corals. Additionally, our data suggest that formation of extant hybrid Acropora genets pre-dates the widespread collapse of the parent taxa.","[Irwin, Adele; Humston, Robert; Cabe, Paul] Washington & Lee Univ, Dept Biol, 204 W Washington St, Lexington, VA 24450 USA; [Greer, Lisa] Washington & Lee Univ, Dept Geol, 204 W Washington St, Lexington, VA 24450 USA; [Devlin-Durante, Meghann; Baums, Iliana B.] Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, 213 Mueller, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Lescinsky, Halard] Otterbein Univ, Dept Biol & Earth Sci, Sci Ctr, 1 South Grove St, Westerville, OH 43081 USA; [Wirth, Karl] Macalester Coll, Olin Rice Sci Ctr, Dept Geol, 113,1600 Grand Ave, St Paul, MN 55105 USA; [Curran, H.

While avoidance of UV radiation has been proposed as the main driver of this behaviour, sheltering behaviour has only been studied during the day and over short timeframes. Here we applied passive acoustic telemetry techniques to continuously monitor shelter usage patterns by large reef fishes over a period of 7 months. For three sweetlip species (Haemulidae), one snapper species (Lutjanidae) and one surgeonfish species (Acanthuridae), diurnal shelter use was remarkably consistent, with occupation of shelters throughout the day, and under all weather conditions, suggesting that factors other than UV avoidance may be important in driving shelter use. Large-scale observations revealed that all fish species appeared to undertake long-distance migrations (> 1 km) away from their shelter sites each night. With the exception of the surgeonfish Acanthurus dussumieri, all fishes returned to the same areas to shelter for the entire study period. Individuals of A. dussumieri, however, failed to return on the night of a severe tropical cyclone. They never reappeared at the shelter sites. The disappearance of this species suggests that A. dussumieri probably forage at night in a different location to the carnivorous haemulids and lutjanids. Overall, this study highlights the long-term importance of shelter structures for fishes that may range over large areas of coral reefs.","[Khan, Joanna A.; Tebbett, Sterling B.; Bellwood, David R.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Khan, Joanna A.; Tebbett, Sterling B.; Bellwood, David R.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Goatley, Christopher H.

This could negatively affect major calcifying reef organisms. In this study, the effects of different levels of CO2-driven acidification of seawater (control: pH 8.1; moderate: pH 7.8; intermediate: pH 7.5; and severe: pH 7.2) on the net calcification rate and activity of enzymes related to the calcification process (Ca-ATPase and carbonic anhydrase) were evaluated in the calcareous hydrozoan Millepora alcicornis. The experiment was run for 30 d using a marine mesocosm system. Net calcification ratio was significantly reduced in hydrocorals exposed to intermediate seawater acidification for 16 d and to severe seawater acidification for 16 d or 30 d, compared to animals at control conditions. However, only hydrocorals exposed to severe seawater acidification showed lower net calcification rates than those exposed to control conditions for 30 d. In accordance, the activities of enzymes involved in the calcification process markedly increased in hydrocorals exposed to reduced pH. Ca-ATPase seemed to be more sensitive to seawater acidification than carbonic anhydrase as it increased in hydrocorals exposed to intermediate and severe seawater acidification for 30 d, while carbonic anhydrase activity was only stimulated under severe seawater acidification. Therefore, our findings clearly show that the hydrocoral M. alcicornis is able to cope, to some extent, with long-term CO2-driven acidification of seawater (pH ae<yen> 7.5). In addition, they show that Ca-ATPase plays a key role in the maintenance of calcification rate under scenarios of moderate and intermediate levels of seawater acidification. However, the observed increase in Ca-ATPase and carbonic anhydrase activity was not enough to compensate for the effects of CO2-driven reduction in seawater pH on the net calcification rate of the hydrocoral M. alcicornis under a scenario of severe ocean acidification (pH 7.2).","[de Barros Marangoni, Laura Fernandes; Marques, Joseane Aparecida; Bianchini, Adalto] Univ Fed Rio Grande, Inst Oceanog, Av Italia Km 8, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil; [Calderon, Emiliano Nicolas; Santos Duarte, Gustavo Adolpho; Castro, Clovis Barreira e] Univ Fed Rio Janeiro, Museu Nacl, Parque Quinta Boa Vista, BR-20940040 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Calderon, Emiliano Nicolas; Santos Duarte, Gustavo Adolpho; Pereira, Cristiano Macedo] Inst Coral Vivo, BR-20940040 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Bianchini, Adalto] Univ Fed Rio Grande, Inst Ciencias Biol, FURG, Campus Carreiros, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil",3,10.1007/s00338-017-1605-6,2017

Stichopus herrmanni, listed as vulnerable (IUCN), is currently a major fishery species on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and throughout the Indo-Pacific. It is critical to characterise how this species interacts with its environment to understand how its removal may impact ecosystem functionality. We investigated seasonal variation in movement, bioturbation, feeding and gonad development of S. herrmanni over 3 yr at One Tree Reef, which has been a no-take area for decades. We determined the direct influence of the deposit-feeding activity of S. herrmanni on sediment turnover and granulometry, and on the abundance of infauna and benthic productivity in a comprehensive in situ analysis of tropical holothuroid feeding ecology. This species is highly mobile with identifiable individuals exhibiting site fidelity over 3 yr. With the potential to turn over an estimated 64-250 kg individual(-1) yr(-1), S. herrmanni is a major bioturbator. Stichopus herrmanni is a generalist feeder and influences trophic interactions by altering the abundance of infauna and microalgae. Stichopus herrmanni exhibited decreased feeding activity and gonad development in winter, the first documentation of a seasonal disparity in the bioturbation activity of a tropical holothuroid. Sediment digestion and dissolution by S. herrmanni has the potential to influence seawater chemistry, a particularly important feature in a changing ocean.

This is important because composition of the sediment is commonly used to estimate water depth in ancient carbonate rocks. The site located at the King Abdullah Economic City (Saudi Arabia) contains a fringing reef with the reef tract located very close to the beach at the north end, flaring to the south to produce a narrower backreef area compared to the other two sites. This geometry produces a north to south current with a velocity of up to 15 cm s(-1), particularly during high onshore winds. The sediments contain predominantly non-skeletal grains, including peloids, coated grains, ooids, and grapestones that form on the bottom. The percentage of coralgal grains in the sediment was significantly lower than at the other two sites studied. Om Al Misk Island and Shoaiba have a much lower-velocity current within the backreef zone and contain predominantly coralgal sediments from the beach to the landward edge of the reef tract. The two locations containing the predominantly coralgal microfacies were statistically similar, but the King Abdullah Economic City site was statistically different despite having a similar water depth profile. Slight differences in reef configuration, including reef orientation and distance from the shore, can produce considerable differences in sediment thickness and composition within the backreef environment, which should induce caution in the interpretation of water depth in ancient carbonate rocks using composition.","[Missimer, T.

At one site, the genus-level composition in 2012 was identical to that before the cyclone, although it took around 30 yr to recover, and there were still differences at the species level. The colony size structure of some species at this site, notably the dominant Acropora digitifera, which had over 40% cover in 2012, also recovered after 30 yr, although sub-dominant species still lacked large colonies even after 40 yr. Given the small scale of the individual study plots (1 m(2)), this shows an unexpected degree of determinism in assemblage structure. At a second site, however, both composition and size structure changed dramatically over the last 40 yr of the study as both external and internal factors altered local environmental conditions. At both sites, major changes in composition appear to be related to drying out of the reef crest due to changes in flow regimes and/or natural accretion. At the site that has recovered, erosion has reversed this drying out, whereas no such erosion has occurred at the second site. If such erosion occurs, or sea levels increase due to global warming, then the second site may also prove to be resilient over decadal time scales.","[Tanner, Jason E.] SARDI Aquat Sci, POB 120, Henley Beach, SA 5040, Australia",4,10.1007/s00338-017-1614-5,2017

DNA sequences were assigned to taxa using available genetic repositories or custom genetic databases generated from reference fishes. Our approach revealed a diversity of conspicuous, cryptobenthic, and commercially relevant reef fish at the genus level, with select genera in the family Labridae over-represented. Our approach, however, failed to capture a significant fraction of the fish fauna known to inhabit the Red Sea, which we attribute to limited spatial sampling, amplification stochasticity, and an apparent lack of sequencing depth.

Such variation is typically driven by ecological and demographic factors, including adult sex ratio and consequent availability of mates. The spatial scale at which demographic factors affect mating competition and sexual selection may vary but is not often investigated. Here, we analyse variation in size and sex ratio of social groups, and how group structure affects mating competition, in the site-attached damselfish Chrysiptera cyanea. Site-attached reef fishes are known to show extensive intraspecific variation in social structure. Previous work has focused on species for which the size and dynamics of social groups are constrained by habitat, whereas species with group structure unconstrained by habitat have received little attention. Chrysiptera cyanea is such a species, with individuals occurring in spatial clusters that varied widely in size and sex ratio. Typically, only one male defended a nest in multi-male groups. Nest-holding males were frequently visited by mate-searching females, with more visits in groups with more females, suggesting that courtship and mating mostly occur within groups and that male mating success depends on the number of females in the group. Male-male aggression was frequent in multi-male groups but absent in single-male groups. These findings demonstrate that groups are distinct social units. In consequence, the dynamics of mating and reproduction are mainly a result of group structure, largely unaffected short term by overall population demography which would be important in open social systems. Future studies of the C. cyanea model system should analyse longer-term dynamics, including how groups are formed, how they vary in relation to density and time of season and how social structure affects sexual selection.","[Wacker, Sebastian; Ness, Miriam Horstad; Ostlund-Nilsson, Sara; Amundsen, Trond] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Ostlund-Nilsson, Sara] Natl Lib Norway, 2674 Solli, N-0203 Oslo, Norway",0,10.1007/s00338-017-1623-4,2017

However, little is known about the causes of variation in the repeatability of behavioral differences among species because rarely have comparative studies been undertaken to examine the repeatability of behavioral differences among individuals within their natural ecological settings. Using two species of endemic subtropical anemonefishes, Amphiprion mccullochi and A. latezonatus at Lord Howe and North Solitary Islands, Australia, we conducted an in situ comparative analysis of personality traits, examining the repeatability of boldness, sociability and aggression as well as the potential role of environmental and social factors on behavioral expression. For A. mccullochi, only boldness and aggression were highly repeatable and these behaviors formed a behavioral syndrome. For A. latezonatus, none of the three behaviors were repeatable due to low-inter-individual variation in behavior. We suggest that the harsher and more variable environmental and social conditions experienced by A. latezonatus have resulted in reduced repeatability in behavior, in contrast to A. mccullochi which typically inhabits a more stable lagoonal reef environment. Additionally, group size and size rank, rather than nearest-neighbor distance and anemone size, influenced the expression of these behaviors in both species, suggesting that behavioral variation was more sensitive to social than environmental factors. Overall, differences in repeatability between these closely related species likely reflect adaptations to contrasting environmental and social conditions, although alternative explanations must be considered. The differences in behavioral consistency between these two endemic anemonefishes could lead to disparity in their resilience to environmental or social change in the future.","[Wong, Marian Y.

They are divided in nine different clades (A-I), which typically associate with different hosts.

We tested whether three omega 3 fatty acids (stearidonic acid, SDA; docosapentaenoic acid, DPA; and docosahexaenoic acid, DHA) that are typically translocated from Symbiodinium to its host are produced by Symbiodinium types within clades A-F associated with Mussismilia hispida (scleractinian coral), Berghia stephanieae (nudibranch), and Tridacna crocea (giant clam) larvae. We acquired and spawned broodstock for each host, cultured their larvae, and offered Symbiodinium types belonging to clades A-F. Samples were taken during a 72-h window after the offer of Symbiodinium, and fatty acids were extracted and analyzed by gas chromatography. The concentrations of SDA and DPA for all host larvae-dinoflagellate associations were low and variable, without trends. However, M. hispida planula larvae associated with Symbiodinium A1 and C1 had a statistically significant higher amount of DHA. The veliger larvae of B. stephanieae digested the Symbiodinium, and the amount of DHA remained constant throughout the experiment. The veliger larvae of T. crocea associated with Symbiodinium A1 and C1 also presented a higher amount of DHA, although not statistically different from the other types. These results show that Symbiodinium A1 and C1, in the case of M. hispida and T. crocea (which usually harbor strains within clades A and C), may contribute a small amount of DHA to the larvae of these organisms and form a stronger mutualism than other strains.","[Mies, M.; Guth, A.

We examine how this oceanographic variability affected delivery and individual characteristics of larval spotted sand bass (Paralabrax maculatofasciatus) to an estuarine nursery habitat in southern California. To quantify P. maculatofasciatus settlement patterns, three larval collectors were installed near the mouth of Mission Bay, San Diego CA, and retrieved weekly from June-October of 2012-2015. During 'Blob' conditions in 2014 and 2015, lower settlement rates of spotted sand bass were associated with higher sea surface temperature and lower wind speed, chlorophyll a (chl a) and upwelling. Overall, the number of settlers per day peaked at intermediate chl a values across weeks. Individual characteristics of larvae that settled in 2014-2015 were consistent with a poor feeding environment. Although settlers were longer in length in 2014-15, fish in these years had slower larval otolith growth, a longer larval duration, and a trend towards lower condition, traits that are often associated with lower survival and recruitment. This study suggests that future settlement and recruitment of P. maculatofasciatus and other fishes with similar life histories may be adversely affected in southern California if ocean temperatures continue to rise in the face of climate change.","[Basilio, Anthony; Searcy, Steven] Univ San Diego, Environm & Ocean Sci, San Diego, CA 92110 USA; [Thompson, Andrew R.] NOAA, Fisheries Serv, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Fisheries Resources Div, La Jolla, CA USA",1,10.1371/journal.pone.0188449,2017

Mesophotic coral ecosystem (depths deeper than similar to 30 m) studies have revealed extensive, productive habitats and rich communities. Despite recent advances, mesophotic coral ecosystems remain understudied due to challenges with sampling at deeper depths. The few previous studies of mesophotic coral ecosystems have shown variation across locations in depth-specific species composition and assemblage shifts, potentially a response to differences in habitat or light availability/ water clarity. This study utilized scuba to examine fish and benthic communities from shallow and upper mesophotic (to 45 m) zones of Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (FGBNMS, 28 degrees 0 'N; 93 degrees 50 'W) from 2010-2012. Dominant planktivores were ubiquitous in shallow and upper mesophotic habitats, and comparisons with previous shallow research suggest this community distribution has persisted for over 30 years. Planktivores were abundant in shallow low-relief habitats on the periphery of the coral reef, and some of these sites that contained habitat transitioning from high to low relief supported high biomass of benthic predators. These peripheral sites at FGBNMS may be important for the trophic transfer of oceanic energy to the benthic coral reef. Distinct differences between upper mesophotic and shallow communities were also observed. These included greater overall fish (as well as apex predator) biomass in the upper mesophotic, differences in apex predator community composition between depth zones, and greater percent cover of algae, rubble, sand, and sponges in the upper mesophotic. Greater fish biomass in the upper mesophotic and similar fish community composition between depth zones provide preliminary support that upper mesophotic habitats at FGBNMS have the capacity to serve as refugia for the shallow-water reefs. Diving surveys of the upper mesophotic and shallow-water coral reef have revealed valuable information concerning the reef fish community in the northern Gulf of Mexico, with implications for the conservation of apex predators, oceanic coral reefs, and the future management of FGBNMS.","[Munoz, Roldan C.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Beaufort Lab, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA; [Buckel, Christine A.; Whitfield, Paula E.; Viehman, Shay; Taylor, J.

The invasive seagrass Halophila stipulacea is rapidly altering these seascapes. Since its arrival in the Caribbean in 2002, H. stipulacea has colonized and displaced native sea-grasses, but the function of this invasive seagrass as a juvenile fish habitat remains unknown. To compare diversity, community structure, and abundance of juvenile fish between H. stipulacea and native seagrass beds, fish traps were deployed in four nearshore bays around St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. Traps were deployed in Frenchman, Lindbergh, and Sprat Bays for 24 h intervals in patches of bare sand, patches of H. stipulacea and patches of the native Caribbean seagrasses Thalassia testudinum and Syringodium filiforme. Traps were then deployed in Brewers Bay for 12 h intervals in stands of H. stipulacea and S. filiforme. Relative and total abundances of juvenile fish, identified at least to family, were compared across treatment habitats for each trap deployment period. The catch from H. stipulacea, compared to native seagrasses, comprised a greater abundance of nocturnal carnivores Lutjanus synagris (family Lutjanidae) and Haemulon flavolineatum (family Haemulidae). Additionally, the herbivore species Sparisoma aurofrenatum (family Labridae) and Acanthurus bahianus (family Acanthuridae) and the diurnal carnivore species Pseudopeneus maculatus (family Mullidae) were relatively scarce in H. stipulacea. The catch from sand was much smaller, compared to vegetated habitats, and comprised only L. synagris, H. flavolineatum, and H. aurolineatum. These results provide evidence of reduced family diversity and altered juvenile fish assemblages in H. stipulacea, driven by an abundance of some nocturnal carnivores and scarcity of herbivores and diurnal carnivores. The findings from the present work underpin the need for further investigation and mitigation of this invasion, particularly where H. stipulacea is driving seascape-alterations of key juvenile fish habitats.","[Olinger, Lauren K.; Heidmann, Sarah L.; Durdall, Allie N.; Howe, Colin; Ramseyer, Tanya; Thomas, Sara G.; Lasseigne, Danielle N.; Brown, Elizabeth J.; Cassell, John S.; Donihe, Michele M.; Romero, Mareike D.

Changes in gill structure induced by suspended sediments have been hypothesized to impair gill function and may provide a mechanistic basis for the observed declines; yet, evidence for this is lacking. We exposed juveniles of three reef fish species (Amphiprion melanopus, Amphiprion percula and Acanthochromis polyacanthus) to suspended sediments (0-180 mg l(-1)) for 7 days and examined changes in gill structure and metabolic performance (i.e. oxygen consumption). Exposure to suspended sediments led to shorter gill lamellae in A. melanopus and A. polyacanthus and reduced oxygen diffusion distances in all three species. While A. melanopus exhibited impaired oxygen uptake after suspended sediment exposure, i.e. decreased maximum and increased resting oxygen consumption rates resulting in decreased aerobic scope, the oxygen consumption rates of the other two species remained unaffected. These findings imply that species sensitive to changes in gill structure such as A. melanopus may decline in abundance as reefs become more turbid, whereas species that are able to maintain metabolic performance despite suspended sediment exposure, such as A. polyacanthus or A. percula, may be able to persist or gain a competitive advantage.","[Hess, Sybille; Prescott, Leteisha J.; Hoey, Andrew S.; McMahon, Shannon A.; Rummer, Jodie L.] ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Hess, Sybille; Prescott, Leteisha J.; McMahon, Shannon A.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Wenger, Amelia S.] Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia",4,10.1098/rspb.2017.1279,2017

Here, we find that the detection of reserve effects is challenging and that heterogeneity in benthic habitat composition, specifically branching coral cover, is one of the strongest driving forces of fish assemblages. As expected, the biomass of targeted fish species was generally greater (up to 5 -fold) in no take zones than in fished zones, but we found no differences between the two forms of no take zone: `no-take' versus 'no-entry'. Strong effects of zoning were detected in the remote Far -North inshore reefs and more central outer reefs, but surprisingly fishing effects were absent in the less remote southern locations. Moreover, the biomass of highly targeted species was nearly 2 -fold greater in fished areas of the Far -North than in any reserve (no -take or no -entry) further south. Despite high spatial variability in fish biomass, our results suggest that fishing pressure is greater in southern areas and that poaching within reserves may be common. Our results also suggest that fishers 'fish the line' as stock sizes in exploited areas decreased near larger no -take zones. Interestingly, an analysis of zoning effects on small, non -targeted fishes appeared to suggest a top-down effect from mesopredators, but was instead explained by variability in benthic composition. Thus, we demonstrate the importance of including appropriate covariates when testing for evidence of trophic cascades and reserve successes or failures.","[Castro-Sanguino, Carolina; Bozec, Yves-Marie; Ortiz, Juan Carlos; Mumby, Peter J.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Bozec, Yves-Marie; Mumby, Peter J.] ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Dempsey, Alexandra; Renaud, Philip G.] Khaled Bin Sultan Living Oceans Fdn, Annapolis, MD USA; [Samaniego, Badi R.] Univ Philippines, Sch Environm Sci & Management, Los Banos, Philippines; [Lubarsky, Katie] State Hawaii Div Aquat Resources, Honolulu, HI USA; [Andrews, Stefan] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Perth, WA, Australia; [Komyakova, Valeriya] Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Robbins, William D.] Wildlife Marine, Perth, WA, Australia; [Robbins, William D.] Curtin Univ, Dept Environm & Agr, Perth, WA, Australia; [Robbins, William D.] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Life Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia",1,10.1371/journal.pone.0186146,2017

Diversity on these reefs decreases from the Coral Triangle east through the islands of Melanesia. Despite this pattern having been identified during the early 20 th century, our knowledge about the interaction between pattern and process remains incomplete. To evaluate the structure of coral reef fish communities across Melanesia, we obtained distributional records for 396 reef fish species in five taxa across seven countries. We used hierarchical clustering, nestedness, and multiple linear regression analyses to evaluate the community structure. We also compiled data on life history traits (pelagic larval duration, body size and schooling behavior) to help elucidate the ecological mechanisms behind community structure. Species richness for these taxa along the gradient was significantly related to longitude but not habitat area. Communities are significantly nested, indicating that species-poor communities are largely composed of subsets of the species found on species rich reefs. These trends are robust across taxonomic groups except for the Pomacentridae, which exhibit an anti-nested pattern, perhaps due to a large number of endemic species. Correlations between life history traits and the number of reefs on which species occurred indicate that dispersal and survival ability contribute to determining community structure. We conclude that distance from the Coral Triangle dominates community structure in reef fish; however, conservation of the most species-rich areas will not be sufficient alone to conserve the vivid splendor of this region.","[Drew, Joshua A.] Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, New York, NY USA; [Drew, Joshua A.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Vertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Amatangelo, Kathryn L.] SUNY Coll Brockport, Dept Environm Sci & Biol, Brockport, NY 14420 USA",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0186123,2017

However, the potential contribution of MPAs to fished populations beyond their boundaries is still highly controversial; empirical measures are scarce and modelling studies have produced a range of predictions, including both positive and negative effects. Using a combination of genetic parentage and relatedness analysis, we measured larval subsidies to local fisheries replenishment for Australasian snapper (Chrysophrys auratus: Sparidae) from a small (5.2 km(2)), well-established, temperate, coastal MPA in northern New Zealand. Adult snapper within the MPA contributed an estimated 10.6% (95% CI: 5.5-18.1%) of newly settled juveniles to surrounding areas (approx. 400 km(2)), with no decreasing trend in contributions up to 40 km away. Biophysical modelling of larval dispersal matched experimental data, showing larvae produced inside the MPA dispersed over a comparable distance. These results demonstrate that temperate MPAs have the potential to provide recruitment subsidies at magnitudes and spatial scales relevant to fisheries management. The validated biophysical model provides a cost-efficient opportunity to generalize these findings to other locations and climate conditions, and potentially informs the design of MPA networks for enhancing fisheries management.","[Le Port, A.; Montgomery, J.

Research to inform management strategies that mitigate stressors and promote a healthy ecosystem has focused on the ecology and physiology of coral reefs and associated organisms. Few studies focus on the surrounding pelagic communities, which are equally important to ecosystem function. Zooplankton, often dominated by small crustaceans such as copepods, is an important food source for invertebrates and fishes, especially larval fishes. The reef-associated zooplankton includes a sub-neustonic copepod family that could serve as an indicator species for the community. Here, we describe the generation of a de novo transcriptome for one such copepod, Labidocera madurae, a pontellid from an intensively-studied coral reef ecosystem, Kane' ohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii. The transcriptome was assembled using high-throughput sequence data obtained from whole organisms. It comprised 211,002 unique transcripts, including 72,391 with coding regions. It was assessed for quality and completeness using multiple workflows. Bench-marking-universal-single-copy-orthologs (BUSCO) analysis identified transcripts for 88% of expected eukaryotic core proteins. Targeted gene-discovery analyses included searches for transcripts coding full-length ""giant"" proteins (> 4,000 amino acids), proteins and splice variants of voltage-gated sodium channels, and proteins involved in the circadian signaling pathway. Four different reference transcriptomes were generated and compared for the detection of differential gene expression between copepodites and adult females; 6,229 genes were consistently identified as differentially expressed between the two regardless of reference. Automated bioinformatics analyses and targeted manual gene curation suggest that the de novo assembled L. madurae transcriptome is of high quality and completeness. This transcriptome provides a new resource for assessing the global physiological status of a planktonic species inhabiting a coral reef ecosystem that is subjected to multiple anthropogenic stressors. The workflows provide a template for generating and assessing transcriptomes in other non-model species.","[Roncalli, Vittoria; Christie, Andrew E.; Sommer, Stephanie A.; Cieslak, Matthew C.; Hartline, Daniel K.; Lenz, Petra H.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Bekesy Lab Neurobiol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Sommer, Stephanie A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",5,10.1371/journal.pone.0186794,2017

Specifically, perceptions-based assessments are gaining support, as they can provide efficient and holistic evaluation regarding management issues. This study focuses on coral reefs because they are particularly threatened ecosystems, due to their ecological complexity, socio-economic importance, and the range of environmental drivers that impact them. Research has largely concentrated on assessing proximate threats to coral reefs. Less attention has been given to distal drivers, such as socioeconomic and governance factors. A common understanding of threats related to coral reef degradation is critical for integrated management that takes account of peoples' concerns. This study compares perceptions of drivers of reef health among stakeholders (n = 110) across different sectors and governance levels, in four Caribbean countries. Interview data identified 37 proximate and 136 distal drivers, categorised into 27 themes. Five subgroups of themes connecting proximate and distal drivers were identified. Perceptions of two of these narratives, relating to 'fishing and socioeconomic issues' and 'reef management and coastal development', differed among respondents from different countries and sectors respectively. However, the findings highlight a shared perception of many themes, with 18 of the 27 (67%) mentioned by > 25% of respondents.

This approach illuminates metabolome- wide relationships between molecules and the putative chemical groups that differentiate them (e.g., H-2, CH2, COCH2). MeMSChem profiling was used to analyze a publicly available metabolomic dataset of coral, algal, and fungal mat holobionts (i.e., the host and its associated microbes and viruses) sampled from some of Earth's most remote and pristine coral reefs. Each type of holo-biont had distinct mass shift profiles, even when the analysis was restricted to molecules found in all samples. This result suggests that holobionts modify the same molecules in different ways and offers insights into the generation of molecular diversity. Three genera of stony corals had distinct patterns of molecular relatedness despite their high degree of taxonomic relatedness.

This event was associated with an unusual basin-scale warming in the North Pacific Ocean, with an unprecedented peak intensity of around 20 degrees C-weeks of cumulative heat stress at Lisianksi Island. In situ bleaching surveys and satellite data were used to evaluate the relative importance of potential drivers of bleaching patterns in 2014, assess the subsequent morality and its effects on coral communities and 3D complexity, test for signs of regional acclimation, and investigate long-term change in heat stress in PMNM. Surveys conducted at four island/atoll (French Frigate Shoals, Lisianski Island, Pearl and Hermes Atoll, and Midway Atoll) showed that in 2014, percent bleaching varied considerably between islands/atolls and habitats (back reef/fore reef and depth), and was up to 91% in shallow habitats at Lisianski. The percent bleaching during the 2014 event was best explained by a combination of duration of heat stress measured by Coral Reef Watch's satellite Degree Heating Week, relative community susceptibility (bleaching susceptibility score of each taxon * the taxon's abundance relative to the total number of colonies), depth and region. Mean coral cover at permanent Lisianski monitoring sites decreased by 68% due to severe losses of Montipora dilatata complex, resulting in rapid reductions in habitat complexity. Spatial distribution of the 2014 bleaching was significantly different from the 2002 and 2004 bleaching events likely due to a combination of differences in heat stress and local acclimatization. Historical satellite data demonstrated heat stress in 2014 was unlike any previous event and that the exposure of corals to the bleaching-level heat stress has increased significantly in the northern PMNM since 1982, highlighting the increasing threat of climate change to reefs.","[Couch, Courtney S.; Burns, John H.

Animal groups such as flocks of birds or shoals of fish use simple interaction rules to coordinate their movements with near neighbours. In turn, this coordination allows individuals to gain the benefits of group living such as reduced predation risk and social information exchange. Noise could change how individuals interact in groups if noise is perceived as a threat, or if it masked, distracted or stressed individuals, and this could have impacts on the benefits of grouping. Here, we recorded trajectories of individual juvenile seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) in groups under controlled laboratory conditions. Groups were exposed to playbacks of either ambient background sound recorded in their natural habitat, or playbacks of pile-driving, commonly used in marine construction. The pile-driving playback affected the structure and dynamics of the fish shoals significantly more than the ambient-sound playback. Compared to the ambient-sound playback, groups experiencing the pile-driving playback became less cohesive, less directionally ordered, and were less correlated in speed and directional changes. In effect, the additional-noise treatment disrupted the abilities of individuals to coordinate their movements with one another. Our work highlights the potential for noise pollution from pile-driving to disrupt the collective dynamics of fish shoals, which could have implications for the functional benefits of a group's collective behaviour.","[Herbert-Read, James E.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Kremer, Louise] AgroSup Dijon, Dept Agron Agroequipments Farming & Environm, Dijon, France; [Bruintjes, Rick] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Biosci, Exeter, Devon, England; [Radford, Andrew N.; Ioannou, Christos C.] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol, Avon, England",6,10.1098/rspb.2017.1627,2017

This study aimed to provide an analysis of country level vulnerability focusing on food security implications of climatic disturbances on marine fisheries. The comparative magnitude and distribution of potential food security impacts of climatic disturbances on marine fisheries were assessed for 109 countries by scoring and ranking countries against a set of vulnerability criteria including metrics of national exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity, highlighting the contribution of marine fisheries to national food and nutrition security. Results showed that developing countries in Africa, Asia, Oceania, and Latin America appeared to be most vulnerable, and the key sources of vulnerability differed considerably among the countries. For countries most vulnerable to climate-induced effects on marine fisheries, more than two-thirds of them depended on domestic marine fisheries as a main source of fish supply. Developing appropriate adaptation policies and management plans to reduce the impacts of changing climate is of great importance to sustain food security in these highly vulnerable and heavy marine fisheries-dependent countries.","[Ding, Qi; Chen, Xinjun] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Coll Marine Sci, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xinjun] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Key Lab Sustainable Exploitat Ocean Fisheries Res, Minist Educ, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xinjun] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Ocean Fisheries, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Hilborn, Ray] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fisheries Sci, Box 355020, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Chen, Yong] Univ Maine, Sch Marine Sci, Orono, ME 04469 USA",5,10.1016/j.marpol.2017.05.011,2017

Around the world, tourists pay significant amounts of money to see coral reefs or iconic, large animals such as sharks and manta rays. Scuba diving tourism is broadening and becoming increasingly popular, a novel type of scuba diving which little is known about, is muck diving. Muck diving focuses on finding rare, cryptic species that are seldom seen on coral reefs. This study investigates the value of muck diving, its participant and employee demographics and potential threats to the industry. Results indicate that muck dive tourism is worth more than USD$ 150 million annually in Indonesia and the Philippines combined. It employs over 2200 people and attracts more than 100,000 divers per year. Divers participating in muck dive tourism are experienced, well-educated, have high incomes, and are willing to pay for the protection of species crucial to the industry. Overcrowding of dive sites, pollution and conflicts with fishermen are reported as potential threats to the industry, but limited knowledge on these impacts warrants further research. This study shows that muck dive tourism is a sustainable form of nature based tourism in developing countries, particularly in areas where little or no potential for traditional coral reef scuba diving exists.","[De Brauwer, Maarten; Harvey, Euan S.; McIlwain, Jennifer L.; Hobbs, Jean-Paul A.] Curtin Univ, Dept Environm & Agr, Perth, WA, Australia; [Jompa, Jamaluddin] Hasanuddin Univ, Fac Marine Sci & Fisheries, Makassar, Indonesia; [Burton, Michael] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Perth, WA, Australia",7,10.1016/j.marpol.2017.05.033,2017

Until recently, little was known about these deeper and more inaccessible reefs. The mesophotic coral-reef habitats (20-80 m) were a major reservoir of marine biodiversity, with unique and exceptionally high fish diversity and abundance. Species richness in the study region was 1.4 times, and abundance almost twice, that recorded for similar mesophotic habitats on the Great Barrier Reef in north-east Australia. A review of the published literature revealed that Australia's NW oceanic shoals support the highest fish species richness reported for mesophotic reefs to date. We made regional comparisons of fish community structure (species composition, richness and abundance) and assessed the influence of depth, substrate and location. The presence of consolidated calcareous reef, depth and aspect (a surrogate for exposure) had the greatest influence on species richness. In contrast, aspect and the presence of benthic biota had the greatest influence on fish abundance. Sites most exposed to the prevailing currents (facing north-east) had lowest fish abundance, while highest abundances were recorded on moderately exposed sites (along the north-west and southeast edges). The most abundant species were small (Potnacentrus coelestis) and large (Naso hexacanthus) planktivorous fish. Currently, 29.3% of NE Australia mesophotic reefs are within no-take management zones of the Great Barrier Reef. In contrast, just 1.3% of the NW oceanic shoals are designated as no-take areas. The location and extent of mesophotic reefs remain poorly quantified globally. Because these habitats support significant biodiversity and have the potential to act as important refugia, understanding their extent is critical to maintaining coral-reef biodiversity and resilience and supporting sustainable management.","[Moore, Cordelia] Curtin Univ, Dept Environm & Agr, Bentley Campus, Bentley, WA 6102, Australia; [Moore, Cordelia; Radford, Ben; Heyward, Andrew] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Indian Ocean Marine Res Ctr, 35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Moore, Cordelia; Radford, Ben] Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Environm, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Moore, Cordelia] CSIRO, Oceans & Atmosphere Flagship, PMB 5, Floreat, WA 6014, Australia; [Cappo, Mike] Australian Inst Marine Sci, PMB 3, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Heyward, Andrew] Univ Western Australia, Indian Ocean Marine Res Ctr, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",1,10.1007/s00338-017-1564-y,2017

Laboratory studies on the response of corals to ocean acidification have manipulated the carbonate chemistry of experimental seawater to compare calcification rate changes under present-day and predicted future mean pH/Omega(arag) conditions. These experiments, however, have focused exclusively on differences in mean chemistry and have not considered diurnal variation. The aim of this study was to compare calcification responses of branching coral Acropora fonnosa under conditions with and without diurnal variation in seawater carbonate chemistry. To achieve this aim, we explored (1) a method to recreate natural diurnal variation in a laboratory experiment using the biological activities of a coral-reef mesocosm, and (2) a multi-laser 3D scanning method to accurately measure coral surface areas, essential to normalize their calcification rates. We present a cost-and time-efficient method of coral surface area estimation that is reproducible within 2% of the mean of triplicate measurements. Calcification rates were compared among corals subjected to a diurnal range in pH (total scale) from 7.8 to 8.2, relative to those at constant pH values of 7.8, 8.0 or 8.2. Mean calcification rates of the corals at the pH 7.8-8.2 (diurnal variation) treatment were not statistically different from the pH 8.2 treatment and were 34% higher than the pH 8.0 treatment despite similar mean seawater pH and narag. Our results suggest that calcification of adult coral colonies may benefit from diurnal variation in seawater carbonate chemistry. Experiments that compare calcification rates at different constant pH without considering diurnal variation may have limitations.","[Chan, W. Y.; Eggins, S.

Interactive effects of depth and location were also detected. MCEs in the NWHI can be treated as three regions: southeastern and mid regions primarily separated by the presence and absence, respectively, of the introduced species Lutjanus kastnira, and a northwestern region where fish assemblages are largely composed of endemic species.

However, uncertainty about the strength of population connectivity between individual reefs and NTMRs through larval dispersal remains a major obstacle to effective network design. In this study, larval dispersal among NTMRs and fishing grounds in the Philippines was inferred by conducting genetic parentage analysis on a coral-reef fish (Chaetodon vagabundus). Adult and juvenile fish were sampled intensively in an area encompassing approximately 90 km of coastline. Thirty-seven true parent-offspring pairs were accepted after screening 1978 juveniles against 1387 adults. The data showed all types of dispersal connections that may occur in NTMR networks, with assignments suggesting connectivity among NTMRs and fishing grounds (n = 35) far outnumbering those indicating self-recruitment (n = 2). Critically, half (51%) of the inferred occurrences of larval dispersal linked reefs managed by separate, independent municipalities and constituent villages, emphasising the need for nested collaborative management arrangements across management units to sustain NTMR networks. Larval dispersal appeared to be influenced by wind-driven seasonal reversals in the direction of surface currents. The best-fit larval dispersal kernel estimated from the parentage data predicted that 50% of larvae originating from a population would attempt to settle within 33 km, and 95% within 83 km. Mean larval dispersal distance was estimated to be 36.5 km. These results suggest that creating a network of closely spaced (less than a few tens of km apart) NTMRs can enhance recruitment for protected and fished populations throughout the NTMR network. The findings underscore major challenges for regional coral-reef management initiatives that must be addressed with priority: (1) strengthening management of NTMR networks across political or customary boundaries; and (2) achieving adequate population connectivity via larval dispersal to sustain reef-fish populations within these networks.","[Abesamis, Rene A.; Russ, Garry R.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Abesamis, Rene A.; Alcala, Angel C.] Silliman Univ, Angelo King Ctr Res & Environm Management SUAKCRE, Dumaguete, Philippines; [Saenz-Agudelo, Pablo] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Ciencias Ambient & Evolut, Valdivia, Chile; [Berumen, Michael L.] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Div Biol & Environm Sci & Engn, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; [Bode, Michael] Univ Melbourne, Sch Bot, ARC Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Jadloc, Claro Renato L.] Silliman Univ, Inst Environm & Marine Sci, Dumaguete, Philippines; [Solera, Leilani A.; Villanoy, Cesar L.] Univ Philippines Diliman, Marine Sci Inst, Quezon City, Philippines; [Bernardo, Lawrence Patrick C.] Tokyo Inst Technol, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Nadaoka Lab, Meguro Ku, Tokyo, Japan",2,10.1007/s00338-017-1570-0,2017

Yet, the functional role of these species has been the focus of an ongoing debate lasting at least six decades. Specifically, to what extent are C. striatus herbivorous like the visually similar A. nigrofuscus? To address this question, we used natural feeding surfaces, covered with late successional stage reef-grown algal turfs, to examine turf algal removal by the two species. Surfaces exposed to C. striatus in laboratory experiments exhibited no significant reductions in turf length or area covered by turfing algae. In marked contrast, A. nigrofuscus reduced turf length by 51% and area covered by turfing algae by 15% in 1 h. The gut contents of specimens from the reef revealed that A. nigrofuscus predominantly ingests algae (the dominant item in 79.6-94.7% of gut content quadrats), while C. striatus ingests detritus and sediments (dominant in 99.6-100% of quadrats). Therefore, C. striatus ingests detritus and sediment, leaving mature algal turfs relatively intact, while A. nigrofuscus directly removes and ingests turf algae. The function of C. striatus differs from cropping herbivorous surgeonfishes such as A. nigrofuscus. On coral reefs, C. striatus brush detrital aggregates from algal turfs, removing microorganisms, organic detritus and inorganic sediment. Confusion over the functional role of C. striatus may stem from an inability to fit it into a single functional category.","[Tebbett, Sterling B.; Goatley, Christopher H.

However, management of GBR predatory fish populations is hampered by a lack of knowledge of their distribution and abundance, aside from that of the highly targeted coral trout (Plectropomus spp. and Variola spp.). Furthermore, there is little information on how these fishes respond to environmental stressors such as coral bleaching, outbreaks of coral-feeding starfishes (Acanthaster planci) and storms, which limits adaptive management of their populations as the frequency or severity of such natural disturbances increases under climate change. Here, we document the distribution and abundance of 48 species of reef-associated predatory fishes and assess their vulnerability to a range of natural disturbances. There were clear differences in predatory fish assemblages across the continental shelf, but many species were widespread, with few species restricted to either inshore or offshore waters. There was weak latitudinal structure with only a few species restricted to either the northern or southern GBR. On the whole, predatory fishes were surprisingly resistant to the effects of disturbance, with few clear changes in abundance or species richness following 66 documented disturbances of varying magnitudes.","[Emslie, Michael J.; Cheal, Alistair J.; Logan, Murray] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville Mail Ctr, PMB 3, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia",3,10.1007/s00338-017-1573-x,2017

Here, we explore the relationship between small reef-scale water circulation patterns and measured differences in the abundance, composition and vulnerability of coral assemblages over decades. Changes in coral cover and community structure within Bill's Bay (Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia) over a 22-yr period, during which multiple disturbance events (including mass bleaching, anoxia, and tropical cyclones) have impacted the area, were compared with spatial variation in water residence times (WRT). We found that reef sites associated with longer water residence times (WRT >15 h) experienced higher rates of coral mortality during acute environmental disturbances compared to reef sites with shorter WRT. Shifts in coral community composition from acroporid to faviid-dominated assemblages were also more prominent at sites with long WRT compared to reef sites with shorter WRT, although shifts in community composition were also observed at sites close to shore. Interestingly, these same long-WRT sites also tended to have the fastest recovery rates so that coral cover was returned to original levels of approximately 20% over two decades. This study provides empirical evidence that spatial patterns in water circulation and flushing can influence the resilience of coral communities, thus identifying areas sensitive to emerging threats associated with global climate change.","[Shedrawi, George; Friedman, Kim J.; Simpson, Christopher J.; Speed, Conrad W.; Wilson, Shaun K.] Marine Sci Program, Sci & Conservat Div, Dept Pk & Wildlife, Kensington, WA, Australia; [Falter, James L.; Friedman, Kim J.; Lowe, Ryan J.; Speed, Conrad W.; Wilson, Shaun K.; Zhang, Zhenlin] UWA Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Falter, James L.; Lowe, Ryan J.; Zhang, Zhenlin] Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Environm, Perth, WA, Australia; [Falter, James L.; Lowe, Ryan J.; Zhang, Zhenlin] Univ Western Australia, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Perth, WA, Australia; [Pratchett, Morgan S.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia",5,10.1007/s00338-017-1576-7,2017

We used phylogeography, population genetics and coalescent methods to assess the potential effects of climatic oscillations in the Pleistocene and contemporary oceanographic barriers on the population genetic structure and connectivity of the species. Sequence analyses indicated high genetic diversity and a lack of genetic differentiation throughout the Caribbean and between the two biogeographic provinces. Different lines of evidence depicted demographic expansions of A. saxatilis populations dated to the Pleistocene. The microsatellites exhibited high genetic diversity, and no genetic differentiation was detected within the Caribbean; however, these markers identified a genetic discontinuity between the two western Atlantic biogeographic provinces. Migration estimates revealed gene flow across the Amazon Orinoco Plume, suggesting that genetic divergence may be promoted by differential environmental conditions on either side of the barrier.

Accurate recognition is of particular importance in diverse reef environments. Most evidence on the use of sensory cues focuses on those used in predator avoidance or habitat recognition, with little information on their role in con specific recognition. Yet conspecific recognition is essential for life-history decisions including settlement, mate choice, and dominance interactions. Using a sensory manipulated tank and a two-chamber choice flume, anemonefish conspecific response was measured in the presence and absence of chemical and/or visual cues. Experiments were then repeated in the presence or absence of two heterospecific species to evaluate whether a heterospecific fish altered the conspecific response. Anemonefishes responded to both the visual and chemical cues of conspecifics, but relied on the combination of the two cues to recognize conspecifics inside the sensory manipulated tank. These results contrast previous studies focusing on predator detection where anemonefishes were found to compensate for the loss of one sensory cue (chemical) by utilizing a second cue (visual). This lack of sensory compensation may impact the ability of anemonefishes to acclimate to changing reef environments in the future.","[Johnston, Nicole K.; Dixson, Danielle L.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol Sci, 310 Ferst Dr, Atlanta, GA 30336 USA; [Dixson, Danielle L.] Univ Delaware, Sch Marine Sci & Policy, 103B Robinson Hall, Newark, DE 19716 USA",3,10.1007/s00338-017-1582-9,2017

In this study, we used molecular techniques to study populations of giant barrel sponges across the globe and assessed whether the genetic structure of these populations agreed with current taxonomic consensus or, in contrast, whether there was evidence of cryptic species. Using molecular data, we assessed whether giant barrel sponges in each oceanic realm represented separate monophyletic lineages. Giant barrel sponges from 17 coral reef systems across the globe were sequenced for mitochondrial (partial CO1 and ATP6 genes) and nuclear (ATPs beta intron) DNA markers. In total, we obtained 395 combined sequences of the mitochondrial CO1 and ATP6 markers, which resulted in 17 different haplotypes. We compared a phylogenetic tree constructed from 285 alleles of the nuclear intron ATPs beta to the 17 mitochondrial haplotypes. Congruent patterns between mitochondrial and nuclear gene trees of giant barrel sponges provided evidence for the existence of multiple reproductively isolated species, particularly where they occurred in sympatry. The species complexes in the tropical Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific, however, do not form separate monophyletic lineages. This rules out the scenario that one species of giant barrel sponge developed into separate species complexes following geographic separation and instead suggests that multiple species of giant barrel sponges already existed prior to the physical separation of the Indo-Pacific and tropical Atlantic.","[Swierts, Thomas; Peijnenburg, Katja T.

With the global loss of shallow-water photosynthetic coral reefs, mesophotic coral ecosystems (similar to 30-150 m) may be buffered from some environmental stressors, thereby serving as refuges for a range of organisms including mobile obligate reef dwellers. Yet habitat suitability may be diminished at the depth boundary of photosynthetic coral reefs. We assessed the suitability of coral-reef habitats across the majority of the depth distribution of a common demersal reef fish (Stegastes partitus) ranging from shallow shelf (SS, <10 m) and deep shelf (DS, 20-30 m) habitats in the Florida Keys to mesophotic depths (MP, 60-70 m) at Pulley Ridge on the west Florida Shelf. Diet, behavior, and potential energetic trade-offs differed across study sites, but did not always have a monotonic relationship with depth, suggesting that some drivers of habitat suitability are decoupled from depth and may be linked with geographic location or the local environment. Feeding and diet composition differed among depths with the highest consumption of annelids, lowest ingestion of appendicularians, and the lowest gut fullness in DS habitats where predator densities were highest and fish exhibited risk averse behavior that may restrict foraging. Fish in MP environments had a broader diet niche, higher trophic position, and higher muscle C:N ratios compared to shallower environments. High C:N ratios suggest increased tissue lipid content in fish in MP habitats that coincided with higher investment in reproduction based on gonado-somatic index. These results suggest that peripheral MP reefs are suitable habitats for demersal reef fish and may be important refuges for organisms common on declining shallow coral reefs.","[Goldstein, E.

This study investigates the ecological attributes (abundance, biomass and estimated productivity) of benthic Crustacea in selected microhabitats from a tropical and a temperate location, revealing marked differences in the crustacean assemblages. In general, microhabitats from the tropical location (dead coral, the epilithic algal matrix [algal turfs] and sand) supported high abundances of small individuals (mean length = 0.53 mm vs. 0.96 mm in temperate microhabitats), while temperate microhabitats (the brown seaweed Carpophyllum sp., coralline turf and sand) had substantially greater biomasses of crustaceans and higher estimated productivity rates. In both locations, the most important microhabitats for crustaceans (per unit area) were complex structures: tropical dead coral and temperate Carpophyllum sp. It appears that the differences between microhabitats are largely driven by the size and relative abundance of key crustacean groups. Temperate micro habitats have a higher proportion of relatively large Peracarida (Amphipoda and Isopoda), whereas tropical microhabitats are dominated by small detrital- and microalgal-feeding crustaceans (harpacticoid copepods and ostracods). These differences highlight the vulnerability of tropical and temperate systems to the loss of complex benthic structures and their associated crustacean assemblages.","[Kramer, Michael J.; Bellwood, David R.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Kramer, Michael J.; Bellwood, David R.; Bellwood, Orpha] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Taylor, Richard B.] Univ Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, Leigh Marine Lab, Warkworth, New Zealand",1,10.1007/s00338-017-1588-3,2017

Yet much can be gained by examining the drivers and implications of even subtle changes in reef state. Where strong ecological interactions are discovered, even small changes in abundance can have profound impacts on coral resilience. Indeed, if we are to develop effective early warnings of critical losses of resilience, then monitoring must place greater emphasis on measuring and interpreting changes in reef recovery rates. In terms of mechanism, a more nuanced approach is needed to explore the generality of what might be considered 'dogma'. A more nuanced approach to science will serve managers needs well and help minimise the rise of mediocrity in coral reef ecosystems.","[Mumby, Peter J.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Mumby, Peter J.] Univ Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia",6,10.1007/s00338-017-1591-8,2017

Several testable models have been proposed that explain inter-regional variability as a function of sea-level history and, more recently, a reef platform size model has been proposed from the Maldives (central Indian Ocean) to explain intra-regional (intra-atoll) variability. Here we present chronostratigraphic data from Pipon Island, northern Great Barrier Reef (GBR), enabling us to test the applicability of existing regional island evolution models, and the platform size control hypothesis in a Pacific context. We show that reef platform infilling occurred rapidly (similar to 4-5 mm yr(-1)) under a ""bucket-fill"" type scenario. Unusually, this infilling was dominated by terrigenous sedimentation, with platform filling and subsequent reef flat formation complete by 5000 calibrated years BP (cal BP). Reef flat exposure as sea levels slowly fell post highstand facilitated a shift towards intertidal and sub aerial-dominated sedimentation. Our data suggest, however, a lag of 1500 yr before island initiation (at 3200 cal BP), i.e. later than that reported from smaller and more evolutionarily mature reef platforms in the region. Our data thus support: (1) the hypothesis that platform size acts to influence the timing of platform filling and subsequent island development at intra-regional scales; and (2) the hypothesis that the low wooded islands of the northern GBR conform to a model of island formation above an elevated reef flat under falling sea levels.","[Perry, C.

Yet, the potential ability of MPAs to buffer effects of environmental variability at shorter time scales remains widely unknown. In the tropics, the yearly monsoon cycle is a major natural force affecting marine organisms in tropical regions, and its timing and severity are predicted to change over the coming century, with potentially severe effects on marine organisms, ecosystems and ecosystem services. Here, we assessed the ability of MPAs to buffer effects of monsoon seasonality on seagrass-associated fish communities, using a field survey in two MPAs (no-take zones) and two unprotected (open-access) sites around Zanzibar (Tanzania). We assessed the temporal stability of fish density and community structure within and outside MPAs during three monsoon seasons in 2014-2015, and investigated several possible mechanisms that could regulate temporal stability. Our results show that MPAs did not affect fish density and diversity, but that juvenile fish densities were temporally more stable within MPAs. Second, fish community structure was more stable within MPAs for juvenile and adult fish, but not for subadult fish or the total fish community. Third, the observed effects may be due to a combination of direct and indirect (seagrass-mediated) effects of seasonality and, potentially, fluctuating fishing pressure outside MPAs. In summary, these MPAs may not have the ability to enhance fish density and diversity and to buffer effects of monsoon seasonality on the whole fish community. However, they may increase the temporal stability of certain groups, such as juvenile fish. Consequently, our results question whether MPAs play a general role in the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning under changing environmental conditions in tropical seagrass fish communities.","[Alonso Aller, Elisa; Eklof, Johan S.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, Stockholm, Sweden; [Jiddawi, Narriman S.] Dar Es Salaam Univ, Inst Marine Sci, Zanzibar, Tanzania",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0183999,2017

However, spatial variability in the direction and strength of selection for individual elements of the warning signal may allow phenotypic variation for some components, but not others. Variation in selection may occur if predators only learn particular colour pattern components rather than the entire signal. Here, we used a nudibranch mollusc, Goniobranchus splendidus, which exhibits a conspicuous red spot/white body/yellowrim colour pattern, to test this hypothesis. We first demonstrated that secondary metabolites stored within the nudibranch were unpalatable to a marine organism. Using pattern analysis, we demonstrated that the yellow rim remained invariable within and between populations; however, red spots varied significantly in both colour and pattern. In behavioural experiments, a potential fish predator, Rhinecanthus aculeatus, used the presence of the yellow rims to recognize and avoid warning signals. Yellow rims remained stable in the presence of high genetic divergence among populations. We therefore suggest that how predators learn warning signals may cause stabilizing selection on individual colour pattern elements, and will thus have important implications on the evolution of warning signals.","[Winters, Anne E.; Green, Naomi F.; Cheney, Karen L.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Garson, Mary J.] Univ Queensland, Sch Chem & Mol Biosci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Marshall, N.

For instance, the evolution of an intramandibular jaw joint has aided shifts to corallivory in Chaetodon butterflyfishes following their Miocene colonization of coral reefs. Today, over half of all Chaetodon species consume coral, easily the largest concentration of corallivores in any reef fish family. In contrast with Chaetodon, other chaetodontids, including the long-jawed bannerfishes, remain less intimately associated with coral and mainly consume other invertebrate prey. Here, we test (i) if intramandibular joint (IMJ) evolution in Chaetodon has accelerated feeding morphological diversification, and (ii) if cranial and post-cranial traits were affected similarly. We measured 19 cranial functional morphological traits, gut length and body elongation for 33 Indo-Pacific species. Comparisons of Brownian motion rate parameters revealed that cranial diversification was about four times slower in Chaetodon butterflyfishes with the IMJ than in other chaetodontids. However, the rate of gut length evolution was significantly faster in Chaetodon, with no group-differences for body elongation. The contrasting patterns of cranial and post-cranial morphological evolution stress the importance of comprehensive datasets in ecomorphology. The IMJ appears to enhance coral feeding ability in Chaetodon and represents a design breakthrough that facilitates this trophic strategy. Meanwhile, variation in gut anatomy probably reflects diversity in how coral tissues are procured and assimilated. Bannerfishes, by contrast, retain a relatively unspecialized gut for processing invertebrate prey, but have evolved some of the most extreme cranial mechanical innovations among bony fishes for procuring elusive prey.","[Konow, Nicolai] Univ Massachusetts Lowell, Dept Biol Sci, Lowell, MA 01852 USA; [Price, Samantha; Wainwright, Peter] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Price, Samantha] Clemson Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Abom, Richard; Bellwood, David] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Bellwood, David] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",2,10.1098/rspb.2017.0906,2017

A promising but less studied alternative are community-managed MPAs, where resource users are more involved in MPA design, implementation and enforcement. Here we evaluated effects of government-and community-managed MPAs on the density, size and biomass of seagrass- and coral reef-associated fish, using field surveys in Kenyan coastal lagoons. We also assessed protection effects on the potential monetary value of fish; a variable that increases non-linearly with fish body mass and is particularly important from a fishery perspective. We found that two recently established community MPAs (< 1 km(2) in size, <= 5 years of protection) harbored larger fish and greater total fish biomass than two fished (open access) areas, in both seagrass beds and coral reefs. As expected, protection effects were considerably stronger in the older and larger government MPAs. Importantly, across management and habitat types, the protection effect on the potential monetary value of the fish was much stronger than the effects on fish biomass and size (6.7 vs. 2.6 and 1.3 times higher value in community MPAs than in fished areas, respectively). This strong effect on potential value was partly explained by presence of larger (and therefore more valuable) individual fish, and partly by higher densities of high-value taxa (e.g. rabbitfish). In summary, we show that i) small and recently established community-managed MPAs can, just like larger and older government-managed MPAs, play an important role for local conservation of high-value fish, and that ii) these effects are equally strong in coral reefs as in seagrass beds; an important habitat too rarely included in formal management. Consequently, community-managed MPAs could benefit both coral reef and seagrass ecosystems and provide spillover of valuable fish to nearby fisheries.","[Chirico, Angelica A.

Chi-squared tests show reef type is significantly correlated with CCA abundance and post-hoc tests indicate higher involvement of CCA is associated with stronger reef structure. Additionally, general linear models show coral reefs with higher amounts of CCA had a higher diversity of reef-dwelling organisms. These data have important implications for paleoecology as they demonstrate that CCA increased building capacity, structural integrity, and diversity of ancient coral reefs. The analyses presented here demonstrate that the function of CCA on modern coral reefs is similar to their function on Cenozoic reefs; thus, studies of ancient coral reef collapse are even more meaningful as modern analogues.","[Weiss, Anna; Martindale, Rowan C.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Geol Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA",1,10.1371/journal.pone.0181637,2017

We assess the value chain for nearshore Hawaiian coral reef fisheries, mapping post-catch distribution and disposition, and quantifying associated monetary, food security, and cultural values. We estimate that the total annual value of the nearshore fishery in Hawai'i is $10.3-$16.4 million, composed of non-commercial ($7.2-$12.9 million) and commercial ($2.97 million licensed + $148,500-$445,500 unlicensed) catch. Hawaii's nearshore fisheries provide > 7 million meals annually, with most (> 5 million) from the non-commercial sector. Over a third (36%) of meals were planktivores, 26% piscivores, 21% primary consumers, and 18% secondary consumers. Only 62% of licensed commercial catch is accounted for in purchase reports, leaving 38% of landings unreported in sales. Value chains are complex, with major buyers for the commercial fishery including grocery stores (66%), retailers (19%), wholesalers (14%), and restaurants (< 1%), who also trade and sell amongst themselves. The bulk of total nearshore catch (72-74%) follows a short value chain, with non-commercial fishers keeping catch for household consumption or community sharing. A small amount (similar to 37,000kg) of reef fish-the equivalent of 1.8% of local catch-is imported annually into Hawai'i, 23,000kg of which arrives as passenger luggage on commercial flights from Micronesia. Evidence of exports to the US mainland exists, but is unquantifiable given existing data. Hawaiian nearshore fisheries support fundamental cultural values including subsistence, activity, traditional knowledge, and social cohesion. These small-scale coral reef fisheries provide large-scale benefits to the economy, food security, and cultural practices of Hawai'i, underscoring the need for sustainable management.

In this study, we combined morphology and genetic barcoding (Cytochrome Oxidase I gene) to characterize the seasonal patterns of the larval fish community at two sites in close proximity to coral reefs in the central-north Red Sea: one shallower inshore location (50 m depth) and a nearby site located in deeper and more offshore waters (similar to 500 m depth). Fish larvae were collected using oblique tows of a 60 cm-bongo net (500 mu m mesh size) every month for one year (2013). During the warmer period of the year (June-November), the larval fish stock was comparable between sampling sites. However, during the colder months, abundances were higher in the inshore than in the offshore waters. Taxonomic composition and temporal variation of community structure differed notably between sites, potentially reflecting habitat differences, reproductive patterns of adults, and/or advective processes in the area. Eleven out of a total of 62 recorded families comprised 69-94% of the fish larval community, depending on sampling site and month. Richness of taxa was notably higher in the inshore station compared to the offshore, particularly during the colder period of the year and especially for the gobiids and apogonids. Two mesopelagic taxa (Vin-ciguerria sp. and Benthosema spp.) comprised an important component of the larval community at the deeper site with only a small and sporadic occurrence in the shallower inshore waters.

Understanding the full value of coral reefs to tourism, and the spatial distribution of these values, provides an important incentive for sustainable reef management. In the current work, global data from multiple sources, including social media and crowd-sourced datasets, were used to estimate and map two distinct components of reef value. The first component is local ""reef-adjacent"" value, an overarching term used to capture a range of indirect benefits from coral reefs, including provision of sandy beaches, sheltered water, food, and attractive views. The second component is ""on-reef"" value, directly associated with in-water activities such diving and snorkelling. Tourism values were estimated as a proportion of the total visits and spending by coastal tourists within 30 km of reefs (excluding urban areas). Reef-adjacent values were set as a fixed proportion of 10% of this expenditure. On-reef values were based on the relative abundance of dive-shops and underwater photos in different countries and territories.

Secondly, the paper uses an example of local level fishery management to demonstrate how the logic of neoliberalism translates to regulations which fail to recognise social and political complexities confronting fishers, thereby exacerbating the precarity of food and livelihood security in these communities.

Yet for many commercially and ecologically important coral reef fish species, connectivity among different habitats in a seascape may be more important than any single habitat alone. Approaches to conservation prioritisation that consider seascape connectivity are thus warranted. I demonstrate an approach that can be implemented within a relatively data-poor context, using widely available conservation planning software. Based on clearly stated assumptions regarding species' habitat usage and movement ability, this approach can be adapted to different focal species and contexts, or refined as further data become available. I first derive a seascape connectivity metric based on area-weighted proximity between juvenile and adult habitat patches, and then apply this during spatial prioritisation using the decision-support software Marxan. Using a case study from Micronesia, I present two applications: first, to inform prioritisation for a network of marine protected areas to achieve regional objectives for habitat representation; and second, to identify nursery habitat patches that are most likely to supply juveniles to adult populations on reefs within existing protected areas. Incorporating seascape connectivity in conservation prioritisation highlights areas where small marine protected areas placed on coral reefs might benefit from proximity to other habitats in the seascape, and thus be more effective. Within the context of community tenure over resources, identification of critical nursery habitats to improve the effectiveness of existing marine protected areas indicates where collaboration across community boundaries might be required. Outputs from these analyses are likely to be most useful in regions where management is highly decentralised, imposing spatial constraints on the size of individual protected areas.","[Weeks, Rebecca] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld, Australia",3,10.1371/journal.pone.0182396,2017

However, we often lack a deep understanding of the fishing process, despite its importance for understanding and managing fisheries. A quantitative, mechanistic understanding of the opportunities fishers encounter, the constraints they face, and how they make decisions within the context of opportunities and constraints will enhance the design of fisheries management strategies to meet linked ecological and social objectives and will improve scientific capacity to predict impacts of different strategies. We examined the case of spearfishing in a Caribbean coral reef fishery. We mounted cameras on fishers' spearguns to observe the fish they encountered, what limited their ability to catch fish, and how they made decisions about which fish to target. We observed spearfishers who dove with and without the assistance of compressed air, and compared the fishing process of each method using content analysis of videos and decision models of fishers' targeting selections. Compressor divers encountered more fish, took less time to catch each fish, and had a higher rate of successful pursuits. We also analyzed differences among taxa in this multispecies fishery, because some taxa are known to be ecologically or economically more valuable than others. Parrotfish are ecologically indispensable for healthy coral reefs, and they were encountered and captured more frequently than any other taxon. Fishers made decisions about which fish to target based on a fish's market value, proximity to the fisher, and taxon. The information uncovered on fishers' opportunities, constraints, and decision making has implications for managing this fishery and others. Moreover, it demonstrates the value of pursuing an improved understanding of the fishing process from the perspective of the fishers.","[Pavlowich, Tyler; Kapuscinski, Anne R.] Dartmouth Coll, Environm Studies Program, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",1,10.1371/journal.pone.0181617,2017

These fishes are primarily apex piscivores and generally the first species over-exploited in small-scale fisheries. The disparities between the fish communities on the two island shelves cannot be explained solely by differences in habitat (coral cover, rugosity) or fisheries management, such as relative amount of marine protected area in local waters.

Widespread coral-bleaching events, induced by prolonged heat stress, highlight the importance of how the duration and frequency of thermal stress influence the adaptive physiology of photosymbiotic calcifiers. Large benthic foraminifera harboring algal endosymbionts are major tropical carbonate producers and bioindicators of ecosystem health. Like corals, they are sensitive to thermal stress and bleach at temperatures temporarily occurring in their natural habitat and projected to happen more frequently. However, their thermal tolerance has been studied so far only by chronic exposure, so how they respond under more realistic episodic heat-event scenarios remains unknown. Here, we determined the physiological responses of Amphistegina gibbosa, an abundant western Atlantic foraminifera, to four different treatments control, single, episodic, and chronic exposure to the same thermal stress (32 degrees C) in controlled laboratory cultures. Exposure to chronic thermal stress reduced motility and growth, while antioxidant capacity was elevated, and photosymbiont variables (coloration, oxygen-production rates, chlorophyll a concentration) indicated extensive bleaching. In contrast, single- and episodic-stress treatments were associated with higher motility and growth, while photosymbiont variables remained stable. The effects of single and episodic heat events were similar, except for the presumable occurrence of reproduction, which seemed to be suppressed by both episodic and chronic stress. The otherwise different responses between treatments with thermal fluctuations and chronic stress indicate adaptation to thermal peaks, but not to chronic exposure expected to ensue when baseline temperatures are elevated by climate change. This firstly implies that marine habitats with a history of fluctuating thermal stress potentially support resilient physiological mechanisms among photosymbiotic organisms. Secondly, there seem to be temporal constraints related to heat events among coral reef environments and reinforces the importance of temporal fluctuations in stress exposure in global-change studies and projections.","[Stuhr, Marleen; Reymond, Claire E.; Westphal, Hildegard] Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Res ZMT, Dept Biogeochem & Geol, Bremen, Germany; [Rieder, Vera; Rahnenfuehrer, Joerg] TU Dortmund Univ, Dept Stat, Dortmund, Germany; [Hallock, Pamela] Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL USA; [Westphal, Hildegard] Univ Bremen, Dept Geosci, Bremen, Germany; [Kucera, Michel] Univ Bremen, MARUM, Ctr Marine Environm Sci, Bremen, Germany",5,10.1371/journal.pone.0179753,2017

While each stressor in isolation has been studied extensively, there has been less focus on their combined effects, which could impact key ecological processes. We tested the independent and combined effects of short-term exposure to elevated CO2 and temperature on the predator-prey interactions of a common pair of coral reef fishes (Pomacentrus wardi and its predator, Pseudochromis fuscus). We found that predator success increased following independent exposure to high temperature and elevated CO2. Overall, high temperature had an overwhelming effect on the escape behaviour of the prey compared with the combined exposure to elevated CO2 and high temperature or the independent effect of elevated CO2. Exposure to high temperatures led to an increase in attack and predation rates. By contrast, we observed little influence of elevated CO2 on the behaviour of the predator, suggesting that the attack behaviour of P. fuscus was robust to this environmental change. This is the first study to address how the kinematics and swimming performance at the basis of predator-prey interactions may change in response to concurrent exposure to elevated CO2 and high temperatures and represents an important step to forecasting the responses of interacting species to climate change.","[Allan, Bridie J.

Habitat degradation modifies the sensory landscape within which predator-prey interactions occur, with implications for olfactory-mediated behaviours. Predator na ve settlement stage damselfish rely on conspecific damage-released odours (i.e., alarm odours) to inform risk assessments. Yet, species such as the Ambon damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis, become unable to respond appropriately to these cues when living in dead-degraded coral habitats, leading to increased mortality through loss of vigilance. Reef fish predators also rely on odours from damaged prey to locate, assess prey quality and engage in prey-stealing, but it is unknown whether their responses are also modified by the change to dead degraded coral habitats. Implications for prey clearly depend on how their predatory counterparts are affected, therefore the present study tested whether olfactory-mediated foraging responses in the dusky dottyback, Pseudochromis fuscus, a common predator of P. amboinensis, were similarly affected by coral degradation. A y-maze was used to measure the ability of Ps. fuscus to detect and move towards odours, against different background water sources. Ps. fuscus were exposed to damage-released odours from juvenile P. amboinensis, or a control cue of seawater, against a background of seawater treated with either healthy or dead-degraded hard coral. Predators exhibited an increased time allocation to the chambers of y-mazes injected with damage-released odours, with comparable levels of response in both healthy and dead-degraded coral treated waters. In control treatments, where damage-released odours were replaced with a control seawater cue, fish showed no increased preference for either chamber of the y-maze. Our results suggest that olfactory-mediated foraging behaviours may persist in Ps. fuscus within dead-degraded coral habitats. Ps. fuscus may consequently gain a sensory advantage over P. amboinensis, potentially altering the outcome of predator-prey interactions.","[Natt, Michael; McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Natt, Michael; McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, Dept Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Lonnstedt, Oona M.] Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Genet, Limnol, Uppsala, Sweden",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0179300,2017

However the drivers of MPA performance are complex and there are likely to be trade-offs between different types of performance (e.g. conservation or welfare related outcomes). We compiled a global dataset from expert knowledge for 76 coral reef MPAs in 33 countries and identified a set of performance measures reflecting ecological and socio-economic outcomes, achievement of aims and reduction of threats, using spatial or temporal comparisons wherever possible. We wanted to test the extent to which distinct types of performance occurred simultaneously, understood as win-win outcomes. Although certain performance measures were correlated, most were not, suggesting trade-offs that limit the usefulness of composite performance scores. Hypotheses were generated as to the impact of MPA features, aims, location, management and contextual variables on MPA performance from the literature. A multivariate analysis was used to test hypotheses as to the relative importance of these ""drivers"" on eight uncorrelated performance measures. The analysis supported some hypotheses (e.g. benefit provision for the local community improved performance), but not others (e.g. higher overall budget and more research activity did not). Factors endogenous to the MPA (such as size of the no-take area) were generally more significant drivers of performance than exogenous ones (such as national GDP). Different types of performance were associated with different drivers, exposing the tradeoffs inherent in management decisions. The study suggests that managers are able to influence MPA performance in spite of external threats and could inform adaptive management by providing an approach to test for the effects of MPA features and management actions in different contexts and so to inform decisions for allocation of effort or funds to achieve specific goals.","[Hargreaves-Allen, Venetia Alexa] Imperial Coll, Ctr Environm Policy, London, England; [Mourato, Susana] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England; [Milner-Gulland, Eleanor Jane] Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Silwood Pk, Ascot, Berks, England; [Milner-Gulland, Eleanor Jane] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford, England",3,10.1371/journal.pone.0179394,2017

Our study focuses on nine closely related and ecologically similar coral reef fish species to test the importance of individual-versus species-level traits in determining the size of dietary, foraging substrate, and behavioural interaction niches. Specifically, we asked: (i) what level of biological organization best describes individual-level niches? and (ii) how are herbivore community niches partitioned among species, and are niche widths driven by species-or individual-level traits? Dietary and foraging substrate niche widths were best described by species identity, but no level of taxonomy explained behavioural interactions. All three niches were dominated by only a few species, contrasting expectations of niche complementarity. Species-and individual-level traits strongly drove foraging substrate and behavioural niches, respectively, whereas the dietary niche was described by both. Our findings underscored the importance of species-level traits for community-level niches, but highlight that individual-level trait variation within a select few species may be a key driver of the overall size of niches.","[Allgeier, Jacob E.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Burkepile, Deron E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Adam, Thomas C.; Burkepile, Deron E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Marine Sci Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",1,10.1098/rspb.2017.0307,2017

Here, using crest nets, which provide a non-selective measure of the total abundance and assemblage of larvae settling to a reef (i.e. larval supply), we collected larval coral reef fishes at five locations surrounding two spatially disparate French Polynesian islands: Moorea and Nengo-Nengo. Overall, larval settlement patterns were correlated with the lunar cycle, with larval abundance peaking during the new moon. Although there were some spatial differences in larval supply among the five monitored sites, settlement patterns were largely consistent, even at the species level, irrespective of factors such as coastline orientation or distance between sites.

Mitochondrial DNA analysis demonstrated that the individuals from Baengnyeongdo and Tongyeong all belonged to the SOL, whereas those from Gijang, Jumunjin, and Wakkanai included individuals from both the NOL and SOL (over 75% NOL). Population structure analyses were performed on the same individuals using seven microsatellite DNA markers.

The high heterogeneity indicated that the former was probably A. japonicus and the latter probably A. heian. However, the admixture proportion in the Jumunjin and Gijang sand lances was 0.71-0.75 for the southern group, indicating that hybridization and unidirectional introgression from SOL to NOL occurs in southwestern margin of the East Sea.

The model estimates CaCO3 bioerosion of individual coral colonies by the sea urchin Eucidaris galapagensis, which recently caused coral reef collapse in the central and southern Galapagos Islands. Numerous projections of the CaCO3 production potential of Wellington Reef 50 years into the future were generated using a simulation model by subjecting the Wellington Reef to El Niao Southern Oscillation warming events and a range of urchin density levels, resulting in varying degrees of coral mortality and subsequent bioerosion by E. galapagensis. Moderate increases in sea urchin abundance above current low levels were found to significantly increase the likelihood of Wellington Reef collapse. The large differences in the recovery of the Galapagos coral reefs across a small latitudinal scale where differences in local echinoid abundances exist make this study of the recovery potential of the Wellington Reef important in understanding the contrast between a resilient reef and ones that are susceptible to collapse.

In Eilat, the field survey found that H. spinosa was prevalent in shallow depths, on cryptic, shaded substrates. Histological analysis of spermatogenesis and oogenesis, and a determination of the gonad index in monthly samples revealed a seasonal reproductive cycle that was significantly correlated with seawater temperature, associated with photoperiod and food availability. All measures of reproduction showed the highest activity in the summer (June-August), and a short resting period in the winter months (December-March). H. spinosa individuals were rarely observed on artificial structures. Thus, the introduction of H. spinosa into new regions as part of a fouling community is relatively unlikely.

Some of these changes in nutrient availability were consistent with known ecological processes occurring on Heron Island and its surrounding waters.

Several environmental parameters were strongly correlated, such as total and dissolved organic carbon with each other and with nitrate and sulfate, respectively. Amongst biomass components, skeletal content was significantly correlated with temperature, DNA with total organic carbon, and skeleton and lipid biomass with orthophosphate concentration, which was significantly higher in lower water temperatures.

Here, we studied changes in cover of corals, algal turfs, benthic cyanobacterial mats, macroalgae, sponges and crustose coralline algae at four reef sites of the Caribbean islands of Cura double dagger ao and Bonaire over a time span of 40 yr. Permanent 9 m(2) quadrats at 10, 20, 30 and 40 m depth were photographed at 3- to 6-yr intervals from 1973 to 2013. The temporal and spatial dynamics in the six dominant benthic groups were assessed based on image point-analysis. Our results show consistent patterns of benthic community change with a decrease in the cover of calcifying organisms across all sites and depths from 32.6 (1973) to 9.2% (2013) for corals and from 6.4 to 1% for crustose coralline algae. Initially, coral cover was replaced by algal turfs increasing from 24.5 (1973) to 38% around the early 1990s. Fleshy macroalgae, still absent in 1973, also proliferated covering 12% of the substratum approximately 20 yr later. However, these new dominants largely declined in abundance from 2002 to 2013 (11 and 2%, respectively), marking the rise of benthic cyanobacterial mats. Cyanobacterial mats became the most dominant benthic component increasing from a mere 7.1 (2002) to 22.2% (2013). The observed increase was paralleled by a small but significant increase in sponge cover (0.5 to 2.3%). Strikingly, this pattern of degradation and phase change occurred over the reef slope down to mesophotic depths of 40 m. These findings suggest that reefs dominated by algae may be less stable than previously thought and that the next phase may be the dominance of slimy cyanobacterial mats with some sponges.","[de Bakker, Didier M.; Meesters, Erik H.] Wageningen UR, Wageningen Marine Res, POB 57, NL-1780 AB Den Helder, Netherlands; [de Bakker, Didier M.; van Duyl, Fleur C.] NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Marine Microbiol & Biogeochem, POB 59, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands; [de Bakker, Didier M.; van Duyl, Fleur C.; Bak, Rolf P.

Coral communities at this locality are the southernmost on the African continent, non-accretive, attain high biodiversity and are dominated by soft corals. Long-term monitoring within fixed transects on representative reef was initiated in 1993 and has entailed annual photo-quadrat surveys and hourly temperature logging. Although sea temperatures rose by 0.15 A degrees C p.a. at the site up to 2000, they have subsequently been decreasing, and the overall trend based on monthly means has been a significant decrease of 0.03 A degrees C p.a. Despite this, minor bleaching was encountered in the region during the 1998 El Nio-Southern Oscillation event, again in the summer of 2000/2001 and in 2005. A significant decreasing trend of 0.95% p.a. in soft coral cover has been evident throughout the monitoring period, attributable to significant decreases in Sinularia and Lobophytum spp. cover. In contrast, hard coral cover gradually and significantly increased up to 2005, this being largely attributable to increases in cover by Acropora spp. Recruitment success and mortality of both soft and hard corals has displayed high inter-annual variability with increasing but non-significant trends in the last 5 yr. The reduction in soft coral cover has been more consistent and greater than that of hard corals, but it is difficult at this stage to attribute this to changes in water quality, acidification-linked accretion or temperature.","[Porter, S.

To assess the species diversity, intraspecific genetic diversity, and genetic differentiation among populations of the brooding coral Seriatopora spp., we conducted phylogenetic and population genetic analyses using a mitochondrial DNA control region and microsatellites at ten sites in the Ryukyu Archipelago, Japan. At least three genetic lineages of Seriatopora (Seriatopora-A, -B, and -C) were detected in our specimens. We collected colonies morphologically similar to Seriatopora hystrix, but these may have included multiple, genetically distinct species. Although sexual reproduction maintains the populations of all the genetic lineages, Seriatopora-A and Seriatopora-C had lower genetic diversity than Seriatopora-B. We detected significant genetic differentiation in Seriatopora-B among the three populations as follows: pairwise F (ST) = 0.064-0.116 (all P = 0.001), pairwise G''(ST) = 0.107-0.209 (all P = 0.001). Additionally, only one migrant from an unsampled population was genetically identified within Seriatopora-B. Because the peak of the settlement of Seriatopora larvae is within 1 d and almost all larvae are settled within 5 d of spawning, our observations may be related to low dispersal ability. Populations of Seriatopora in the Ryukyu Archipelago will probably not recover unless there is substantial new recruitment from distant populations.","[Nakajima, Yuichi; Mitarai, Satoshi] Grad Univ, Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol, Onna, Okinawa 9040495, Japan; [Nishikawa, Akira; Sakai, Kazuhiko] Univ Ryukyus, Trop Biosphere Res Ctr, Sesoko Stn, Motobu, Okinawa 9050227, Japan; [Iguchi, Akira] Okinawa Coll, Natl Inst Technol, Nago, Okinawa 9052192, Japan; [Nagata, Tomofumi] Okinawa Prefecture Environm Sci Ctr, Urasoe, Okinawa 9012111, Japan; [Uyeno, Daisuke] Kagoshima Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Kagoshima, Kagoshima 8900065, Japan",7,10.1007/s00338-017-1557-x,2017

We assessed community structure of the overall benthic community from 0 to 300 m via non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) of species presence across depth bands. We used the Jaccard index of similarity to calculate the proportion of shared species between adjacent depth bands, measure species turnover with depth, and assess taxonomic overlap between shallow reefs versus progressively deeper depth bands. NMDS ordinations showed that the traditionally defined mesophotic range (30-150 m) as a whole is not a distinct community. In contrast, taxonomically distinct communities, determined by hierarchical clustering, were found at 0-70, 60-120, 110-200, and 190-300 m. Clustering highlighted an important separation in the benthic community at similar to 60 m, which was especially important for actinopterygian fishes. Species turnover between adjacent depths decreased with depth for all taxa combined and individual taxa, with peaks at similar to 60, 90-120, and 190-200 m. Fishes showed lower turnover from shallow to upper mesophotic depths (0-50 m) than all taxa combined, a substantial peak at 60 m, followed by a precipitous and continued decline in turnover thereafter. Taxonomic overlap between shallow (0-20 m) and progressively deeper zones declined steadily with depth in all taxa and individual taxa, suggesting that mid- and lower mesophotic habitats have less (but not inconsequential) potential to serve as refugia (60-150 m, 15-25% overlap with shallow habitats) than upper mesophotic zones (30-60 m, 30-45% overlap with shallow habitats) for all taxa combined. We conclude that the traditional mesophotic zone is home to three ecological communities in the GoMx, one that is confluent with shallow reefs, a distinct mesophotic assemblage spanning 60-120 m, and a third that extends onto the outer continental shelf.","[Semmler, Robert F.; Hoot, Whitney C.; Reaka, Marjorie L.] Univ Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",11,10.1007/s00338-016-1530-0,2017

A non-targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomic approach was developed to study gill mucus of eight butterflyfish species in Moorea (French Polynesia), and the influence of several fish traits (geographic site and reef habitat, species taxonomy, phylogeny, diet and parasitism levels) on the metabolic variability was investigated. A biphasic extraction yielding two fractions (polar and apolar) was used. Fish diet (obligate corallivorous, facultative corallivorous or omnivorous) arose as the main driver of the metabolic differences in the gill mucus in both fractions, accounting for 23% of the observed metabolic variability in the apolar fraction and 13% in the polar fraction. A partial least squares discriminant analysis allowed us to identify the metabolites (variable important in projection, VIP) driving the differences between fish with different diets (obligate corallivores, facultative corallivores and omnivorous). Using accurate mass data and fragmentation data, we identified some of these VIP as glycerophosphocholines, ceramides and fatty acids. Level of monogenean gill parasites was the second most important factor shaping the gill mucus metabolome, and it explained 10% of the metabolic variability in the polar fraction and 5% in the apolar fraction. A multiple regression tree revealed that the metabolic variability due to parasitism in the polar fraction was mainly due to differences between non-parasitized and parasitized fish. Phylogeny and butterflyfish species were factors contributing significantly to the metabolic variability of the apolar fraction (10 and 3%, respectively) but had a less pronounced effect in the polar fraction. Finally, geographic site and reef habitat of butterflyfish species did not influence the gill mucus metabolome of butterflyfishes.","[Reverter, M.; Sasal, P.; Banaigs, B.; Lecchini, D.; Tapissier-Bontemps, N.] Univ Perpignan, PSL Res Univ, EPHE UPVD CNRS, USR CRIOBE 3278, 52 Ave Paul Alduy, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Reverter, M.; Sasal, P.; Banaigs, B.; Lecchini, D.; Lecellier, G.; Tapissier-Bontemps, N.] Lab Excellence CORAIL, F-98729 Moorea, French Polynesi, France; [Lecellier, G.] Univ Paris Saclay Versailles St Quentin En Yvelin, 55 Ave Paris, F-78035 Versailles, France; [Lecellier, G.] UMR250 9220 CNRS IRD UR, ENTROPIE, 101 Promenade Roger Laroque,BP A5, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia",1,10.1007/s00338-017-1554-0,2017

Reliable early warning monitoring tools are needed to assess and monitor coral reef health. Symbiont-bearing foraminifers (Amphistegina gibbosa) were kept under ambient conditions (no sea water acidification and no copper addition) or exposed to combinations of different levels of sea water pH (8.1, 7.8, 7.5 and 7.2) and environmentally relevant concentrations of dissolved copper (measured: 1.0, 1.6, 2.3 and 3.2 A mu g L-1) in a mesocosm system. After 10- and 25-d exposure, foraminifers were analyzed for holobiont Ca2+-ATPase activity, bleaching, growth and mortality. Enzyme activity was inhibited in foraminifers exposed to pH 7.2 and 3.2 A mu g L-1 Cu for 25 d. Bleaching frequency was also higher at pH 7.2 combined with copper addition. There was no significant effect of sea water acidification and copper addition on mortality. However, test size was smaller in foraminifers exposed to copper, with a positive interactive effect of sea water acidification. These findings can be explained by the higher availability of free copper ions at lower water pH. This condition would increase Cu competition with Ca2+ for the binding sites on the organism, thus inhibiting Ca2+-ATPase activity and affecting the organism's overall fitness. Findings reported here suggest that key processes in A. gibbosa, such as calcification and photosynthesis, are affected by the combined effect of global (sea water acidification) and local (copper contamination) stressors. Considering the experimental conditions employed (mesocosm system, possible ocean acidification scenarios, low copper concentrations, biomarkers of ecological relevance and chronic exposure), our findings support the use of foraminifera and biomarkers analyzed in the present study as reliable tools to detect and monitor the ecological impacts of multiple stressors in coral reef environments.","[Marques, Joseane Aparecida; de Barros Marangoni, Laura Fernandes; Bianchini, Adalto] Univ Fed Rio Grande, Inst Oceanog, Programa Posgrad Oceanog Biol, Av Italia,Km 8, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil; [Bianchini, Adalto] Univ Fed Rio Grande, Inst Ciencias Biol, Av Italia,Km 8, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil",4,10.1007/s00338-017-1547-z,2017

Understanding the potential constraints on the timing of this habitat transition, called settlement, is important to understanding their biology. Size-specific mortality can set the limits on lifestyle and help explain ontogenetic habitat shifts. We examined whether size-based mortality risks after settlement may include micropredation by ectoparasites by testing whether survival of settlement-stage fish varies with fish size when exposed to a reef-associated micropredator. Fish (14 species) were exposed to one blood-sucking gnathiid isopod overnight, with appropriate controls; gnathiid feeding success and survival, and fish mortality were recorded relative to fish size. After adjusting for fish relatedness, we found the relationship between fish mortality and size differed with gnathiid exposure: for gnathiid-exposed fish, the mean mortality of the smallest fish was much higher (57%) than unexposed controls (10%), and decreased to similar to 0% for fish > 12 mm standard length (SL); mortality was almost nil in controls. Thus, a predicted optimal size to switch habitat and reduce mortality risk from micropredation should be > 12 mm SL. We then asked what species might be at greater risk and if the steep increase in survival at similar to 12 mm SL might coincide with settlement at larger sizes among fishes. Across 102 other species (32 families), 61% settled at 12 mm SL. After adjusting for relatedness, mean fish settlement size was 15.0 mm and this was not significantly different from 12 mm. Thus, settlement size clusters around the minimum fish size threshold our gnathiid experiment predicted would be large enough to survive a gnathiid encounter. These results suggest micropredators may contribute to size-selective mortality during settlement processes and are consistent with the hypothesis that the pelagic phase provides fish an escape from certain micropredators.","[Grutter, A.

Across 157 sites in Seychelles, Maldives, the Chagos Archipelago, and Australia's Great Barrier Reef, we find that structural complexity and reef zone are the strongest and most consistent predictors of reef fish abundance, biomass, species richness, and trophic structure. However, coral traits, diversity, and life histories provided additional predictive power for models of reef fish assemblages, and were key drivers of structural complexity. Our findings highlight that reef complexity relies on living corals-with different traits and life histories-continuing to build carbonate skeletons, and that these nuanced relationships between coral assemblages and habitat complexity can affect the structure of reef fish assemblages. Seascape-level estimates of structural complexity are rapid and cost effective with important implications for the structure and function of fish assemblages, and should be incorporated into monitoring programs.","[Darling, Emily S.] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Marine Program, Bronx, NY 10460 USA; [Darling, Emily S.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada; [Graham, Nicholas A.

Hydroacoustics were used to locate Nassau grouper FSAs at sites on the west end of Little Cayman (LCW), and east ends of Grand Cayman (GCE) and Cayman Brac (CBE). Fish abundance and biomass at each FSA were estimated via echo integration and FSA extent. Acoustic mean fish abundance estimates (+/- SE) on the FSA at LCW (893 +/- 459) did not differ significantly from concurrent SCUBA estimates (1150 +/- 75). Mean fish densities (number 1000 m(-3)) were significantly higher at LCW (33.13 +/- 5.62) than at the other sites (GCE: 7.01 +/- 2.1, CBE: 4.61 +/- 1.16). We investigate different acoustic post-processing options to obtain target strength (TS), and we examine the different TS to total length (TL) formulas available. The SCUBA surveys also provided measures of TL through the use of laser callipers allowing development of an in situ TS to TL formula for Nassau grouper at the LCW FSA. Application of this formula revealed mean fish TL was significantly higher at LCW (65.4 +/- 0.7 cm) than GCE (60.7 +/- 0.4 cm), but not CBE (61.1 +/- 2.5 cm). Use of the empirical TS to TL formula resulted in underestimation of fish length in comparison with diver measurements, highlighting the benefits of secondary length data and deriving specific TS to TL formulas for each population. FSA location examined with reference to seasonal marine protected areas (Designated Grouper Spawning Areas) showed FSAs were partially outside these areas at GCE and very close to the boundary at CBE. As FSAs often occur at the limits of safe diving operations, hydroacoustic technology provides an alternative method to monitor and inform future management of aggregating fish species.","[Egerton, J.

On average, predators reduced prey abundance through generalist foraging behavior, which, through a statistical sampling artifact, caused a reduction in alpha diversity and an increase in beta diversity.

This study investigated for the first time the effects of developing in projected warmer ocean conditions in the tropical wrasse species: Halichoeres melanurus, Halichoeres miniatus and Thalassoma amblycephalum. New recruits were reared for 11 weeks in control (29 A degrees C) and +2 A degrees C (31 A degrees C) temperature treatments, consistent with predicted increases in sea surface temperature by 2100. A broad range of key attributes and performance parameters was tested, including aerobic metabolism, swimming ability, burst escape performance and physical condition. Response latency of burst performance was the only performance parameter in which evidence of beneficial thermal developmental acclimation was found, observed only in H. melanurus. Generally, development in the +2 A degrees C treatment came at a significant cost to all species, resulting in reduced growth and physical condition, as well as metabolic and swimming performance relative to controls. Development in +2 A degrees C conditions exacerbated the effects of warming on aerobic metabolism and swimming ability, compared to short-term warming effects. Burst escape performance parameters were only mildly affected by development at +2 A degrees C, with non-locomotor performance (response latency) showing greater thermal sensitivity than locomotor performance parameters. These results indicate that the effects of future climate change on tropical wrasses would be underestimated with short-term testing.

Here, we use underwater surveys on the temperate reefs of south-eastern (SE) Australia and western Japan (similar to 33.5A degrees N and S, respectively) to investigate how temperate macroalgal and non-macroalgal habitats influence recruitment success of a range of tropical fishes. We show that temperate macroalgae strongly affected recruitment of many tropical fish species in both regions and across three recruitment seasons in SE Australia. Densities and richness of recruiting tropical fishes, primarily planktivores and herbivores, were over seven times greater in non-macroalgal than macroalgal reef habitat. Species and trophic diversity (K-dominance) were also greater in non-macroalgal habitat. Temperate macroalgal cover was a stronger predictor of tropical fish assemblages than temperate fish assemblages, reef rugosities or wave exposure. Tropical fish richness, diversity and density were greater on barren reef than on reef dominated by turfing algae. One common species, the neon damselfish (Pomacentrus coelestis), chose non-macroalgal habitat over temperate macroalgae for settlement in an aquarium experiment. This study highlights that temperate macroalgae may partly account for spatial variation in recruitment success of many tropical fishes into higher latitudes. Hence, habitat composition of temperate reefs may need to be considered to accurately predict the geographic responses of many tropical fishes to climate change.","[Beck, H. J.; Feary, D.

Research on fishes associated with MCEs is sparse, leading to a critical lack of knowledge of how reef fish found at mesophotic depths may vary from their shallow reef conspecifics. We investigated intraspecific variability in body condition and growth of three Hawaiian endemics collected from shallow, photic reefs (5-33 m deep) and MCEs (40-75 m) throughout the Hawaiian Archipelago and Johnston Atoll: the detritivorous goldring surgeonfish, Ctenochaetus strigosus, and the planktivorous threespot chromis, Chromis verater, and Hawaiian dascyllus, Dascyllus albisella. Estimates of body condition and size-at-age varied between shallow and mesophotic depths; however, these demographic differences were outweighed by the magnitude of variability found across the latitudinal gradient of locations sampled within the Central Pacific. Body condition and maximum body size were lowest in samples collected from shallow and mesophotic Johnston Atoll sites, with no difference occurring between depths. Samples from the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands tended to have the highest body condition and reached the largest body sizes, with differences between shallow and mesophotic sites highly variable among species. The findings of this study support newly emerging research demonstrating intraspecific variability in the life history of coral-reef fish species whose distributions span shallow and mesophotic reefs. This suggests not only that the conservation and fisheries management should take into consideration differences in the life histories of reef-fish populations across spatial scales, but also that information derived from studies of shallow fishes be applied with caution to conspecific populations in mesophotic coral environments.","[Winston, M.

In Okinawa, Japan, the brooder coral Seriatopora hystrix was reported to be locally extinct in a shallow reef while it was found abundant at a MCE nearby. In this context, S. hystrix represents a key model to test the Deep Reef Refuge Hypothesis and to understand the potential contribution of mesophotic corals to shallow coral reef recovery. However, the reproductive biology of mesophotic S. hystrix and its potential to recolonize shallow reefs is currently unknown. This study reports for the first time, different temporal scales of reproductive periodicity and larval settlement of S. hystrix from an upper mesophotic reef (40 m depth) in Okinawa. We examined reproductive seasonality, lunar, and circadian periodicity (based on polyp dissection, histology, and ex situ planula release observations) and larval settlement rates in the laboratory. Mesophotic S. hystrix reproduced mainly in July and early August, with a small number of planulae being released at the end of May, June and August. Compared to shallow colonies in the same region, mesophotic S. hystrix has a 4-month shorter reproductive season, similar circadian periodicity, and smaller planula size. In addition, most of the planulae settled rapidly, limiting larval dispersal potential. The shorter reproductive season and smaller planula size may result from limited energy available for reproduction at deeper depths, while the similar circadian periodicity suggests that this reproductive aspect is not affected by environmental conditions differing with depth. Overall, contribution of mesophotic S. hystrix to shallow reef rapid recovery appears limited, although they may recruit to shallow reefs through a multi-step process over a few generations or through random extreme mixing such as typhoons.","[Prasetia, Rian; Sinniger, Frederic; Hashizume, Kaito; Harii, Saki] Univ Ryukyus, Sesoko Stn, Trop Biosphere Res Ctr, Motobu, Japan",11,10.1371/journal.pone.0177034,2017

This paper characterizes atoll-scale patterns in shallow coral reef habitat and fish community structure, and correlates these with environmental characteristics and anthropogenic factors, critical to conservation efforts for the reefs and the people who depend on them. Hierarchical clustering analyses by site for benthic composition and fish community resulted in the same 3 major clusters: cluster 1-oceanic (close proximity to deep water) and uninhabited (low human impact); cluster 2-oceanic and inhabited (high human impact); and cluster 3-lagoonal (facing the inside of the lagoon) and inhabited (highest human impact). Distance from village, reef exposure to deep water and human population size had the greatest effect in predicting the fish and benthic community structure. Our study demonstrates a strong association between benthic and fish community structure and human use across the Ulithi Atoll (Yap State, Federated States of Micronesia) and confirms a pattern observed by local people that an 'opportunistic' scleractinian coral (Montipora sp.) is associated with more highly impacted reefs. Our findings suggest that small human populations (subsistence fishing) can nevertheless have considerable ecological impacts on reefs due, in part, to changes in fishing practices rather than overfishing per se, as well as larger global trends. Findings from this work can assist in building local capacity to manage reef resources across an atoll-wide scale, and illustrates the importance of anthropogenic impact even in small communities.","[Crane, Nicole L.] Cabrillo Coll, Dept Biol, Aptos, CA 95003 USA; [Crane, Nicole L.] Ocean Soc, Ross, CA 94957 USA; [Crane, Nicole L.; Nelson, Peter; Abelson, Avigdor; Precoda, Kristin; Rulmal, John, Jr.; Bernardi, Giacomo; Paddack, Michelle] One People One Reef, Santa Cruz, CA 95062 USA; [Nelson, Peter] HT Harvey & Associates, Bldg D, Los Gatos, CA USA; [Abelson, Avigdor] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, Ramat Aviv, Israel; [Precoda, Kristin] Univ Sydney, Marine Studies Inst, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Rulmal, John, Jr.] Ulithi Falalop Community Act Program, Yap, Micronesia; [Bernardi, Giacomo] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Paddack, Michelle] Santa Barbara City Coll, Santa Barbara, CA USA",2,10.1371/journal.pone.0177083,2017

While substantial fisheries benefits are often reported, results of quantitative approaches are controversial for benthic macroinvertebrates, whose life history traits may cause low congruence with protective measures implemented at non-ecologically relevant scales. This study investigated the structural and behavioral responses of the exploited topshell Tectus niloticus within a very small (0.2 km(2)) VBMR in Vanuatu, south Pacific. The results of underwater surveys and a nine-month tagging experiment emphasized contrasted, scale-dependent responses. At the reserve scale, our results failed to demonstrate any positive effect of protection after three years of closure. In contrast, abundance, density and biomass increased more than ten-fold in the southern part of the reserve, along with significantly larger |(25%) individual sizes. The dispersal of tagged specimens was also consistently lower after 2, 4 and 9 months in the latter zone. Analyses of 17 substratum variables revealed a marked small-scale patchiness delineating contrasted benthic microhabitats, the distribution of which closely matched that of trochus. We advocate that i) VBMRs have inherently unequal ecological potentials for protecting and managing highly habitat-dependent species such as trochus; ii) 'success' or 'failure' is to a certain extent pre-determined by the trajectory of species-specific microhabitats, which may outreach protection effects. This has strong implications in the Pacific where the location and size of reserves primarily depends upon marine tenure, and communities have little flexibility in setting reserve boundaries.","[Dumas, Pascal; Leopold, Marc] IRD, UMR ENTROPIE 9220, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Dumas, Pascal; Leopold, Marc] Lab Excellence LABEX Corail, Perpignan, France; [Ham, Jayven; Kaku, Rocky; William, Andrew; Kaltavara, Jeremie; Gereva, Sompert] Fisheries Dept Vanuatu, Port Vila, Vanuatu",1,10.1371/journal.pone.0176922,2017

Exchanges of information are also widespread in ecological systems, but their effects on ecosystem-level processes are largely unknown. Herbivory is a critical ecological process in coral reefs, where diverse assemblages of fish maintain reef health by controlling the abundance of algae. Here, we show that social interactions have a major effect on fish grazing rates in a reef ecosystem. We combined a system for observing and manipulating large foraging areas in a coral reef with a class of dynamical decision-making models to reveal that reef fish use information about the density and actions of nearby fish to decide when to feed on algae and when to flee foraging areas. This ""behavioral coupling"" causes bursts of feeding activity that account for up to 68% of the fish community's consumption of algae. Moreover, correlations in fish behavior induce a feedback, whereby each fish spends less time feeding when fewer fish are present, suggesting that reducing fish stocks may not only reduce total algal consumption but could decrease the amount of algae each remaining fish consumes. Our results demonstrate that social interactions among consumers can have a dominant effect on the flux of energy and materials through ecosystems, and our methodology paves the way for rigorous in situ measurements of the behavioral rules that underlie ecological rates in other natural systems.","[Gil, Michael A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Hein, Andrew M.] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Hein, Andrew M.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Hein, Andrew M.] NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA",4,10.1073/pnas.1615652114,2017

Understanding the relative influence of these two contrasting scales is crucial to improving the management of marine habitats. We used baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVS) to quantify seagrass fish assemblages, and took seagrass cores to quantify seagrass metrics, at ten sites across three seasons in Moreton Bay, Australia to determine if fish are influenced more by seascape context or metrics of seagrass habitat complexity. We found that fish species richness and assemblage composition are most influenced by large-scale variability in seascape (e.g. proximity to ocean and mangroves). However, variability in habitat complexity (e.g. seagrass blade length and density) and proximity to mangrove forests had the greatest effect on assemblage beta diversity. Connectivity with other habitats plays a vital role in structuring the fish community, as it is crucial for daily feeding excursions (mangrove forests) and spawning/reproduction (proximity to ocean). Continuous, non-patchy seagrass beds are however vital to how individuals use a seagrass meadow, with beta diversity being higher in seagrass meadows that were less patchy. Identifying how habitat attributes and context influence fish assemblages is vital for optimizing conservation initiatives. Therefore, we suggest that monitoring populations with biodiversity metrics such as beta diversity can be effective in determining areas that are critical for conservation.","[Henderson, Christopher J.; Lee, Shing Y.; Stevens, Tim] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Coasts & Estuaries, Gold Coast Campus, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia; [Henderson, Christopher J.; Lee, Shing Y.; Stevens, Tim] Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Gold Coast Campus, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia; [Gilby, Ben L.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Sci & Engn, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia",4,10.1007/s00227-017-3149-2,2017

We investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics of spawning and fishing for the barred sand bass, Paralabrax nebulifer, in Punta Abreojos, Mexico from 2010 to 2012 as a means to assess its vulnerability to aggregation fishing by the local commercial fishery. Monthly, spatial patterns in gonadal development in collected females indicated that adults formed spawning aggregations at two sites in Punta Abreojos during July and August. Monthly patterns in the spatial distribution of fishing matched the spawning behavior of P. nebulifer, with effort and catch concentrated at spawning aggregation sites during those months. However, fishing effort, catch, and catch-per-unit effort did not increase during the spawning season, and fishing activities associated with the spawning season comprised only a small percentage of the total annual effort (22%) and catch (17%).Therefore, while the population of P. nebulifer at Punta Abreojos should be vulnerable to aggregation fishing due to the spatio-temporal dynamics of its spawning aggregations, vulnerability is greatly reduced, because fishing activities are not disproportionately focused on spawning aggregations and fishing methods are not optimized to maximize harvest from the aggregations.

Despite the efforts to enhance and coordinate coral reef monitoring within and across countries, our knowledge of the geographic extent of mass coral bleaching over the past few decades is incomplete. Existing databases, like ReefBase, are limited by the voluntary nature of contributions, geographical biases in data collection, and the variations in the spatial scale of bleaching reports. In this study, we have developed the first-ever gridded, global-scale historical coral bleaching database. First, we conducted a targeted search for bleaching reports not included in ReefBase by personally contacting scientists and divers conducting monitoring in under-reported locations and by extracting data from the literature. This search increased the number of observed bleaching reports by 79%, from 4146 to 7429. Second, we employed spatial interpolation techniques to develop annual 0.04 degrees x 0.04 degrees latitude-longitude global maps of the probability that bleaching occurred for 1985 through 2010. Initial results indicate that the area of coral reefs with a more likely than not (> 50%) or likely (> 66%) probability of bleaching was eight times higher in the second half of the assessed time period, after the 1997/1998 El Nino. The results also indicate that annual maximum Degree Heating Weeks, a measure of thermal stress, for coral reefs with a high probability of bleaching increased over time. The database will help the scientific community more accurately assess the change in the frequency of mass coral bleaching events, validate methods of predicting mass coral bleaching, and test whether coral reefs are adjusting to rising ocean temperatures.","[Donner, Simon D.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Rickbeil, Gregory J.

This has motivated coral reef management responses that include restriction and regulation of fishing, e.g. herbivorous fish species. However, there is evidence that eutrophication and sedimentation can be at least as important as a reduction in herbivory in causing phase shifts. These threats arise from coastal development leading to increased nutrient and sediment loads, which stimulate algal growth and negatively impact corals respectively. Here, we first present results of a dynamic process-based model demonstrating that in addition to overharvesting of herbivorous fish, bottom-up processes have the potential to precipitate coral-algal phase shifts on Mesoamerican reefs. We then provide an empirical example that exemplifies this on coral reefs off Mahahual in Mexico, where a shift from coral to algal dominance occurred over 14 years, during which there was little change in herbivore biomass but considerable development of tourist infrastructure. Our results indicate that coastal development can compromise the resilience of coral reefs and that watershed and coastal zone management together with the maintenance of functional levels of fish herbivory are critical for the persistence of coral reefs in Mesoamerica.","[Ernesto Arias-Gonzalez, Jesus] IPN, Lab Ecol Ecosistemas Arrecifes Coralinos, Ctr Invest & Estudios Avanzados, Dept Recursos Mar,Unidad Merida, Carr Ant Progreso Km 6,AP 73 Cordemex, Merida, Yucatan, Mexico; [Fung, Tak] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, 14 Sci Dr 4, Singapore, Singapore; [Seymour, Robert M.] UCL, Ctr Math & Phys Life Sci & Expt Biol, London, England; [Seymour, Robert M.] UCL, Dept Math, London, England; [Rodrigo Garza-Perez, Joaquin] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Unidad Multidisciplinaria Docencia & Invest Sisal, Puerto Abrigo S-N, Sisal, Yucatan, Mexico; [Acosta-Gonzalez, Gilberto] Ctr Invest Cient Yucatan AC, Unidad Ciencias Agua, Calle 8 29 Mza 39 SM 64, Cancun, Q Roo Cp, Mexico; [Bozec, Yves-Marie] Univ Queensland, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Bozec, Yves-Marie] Univ Queensland, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Johnson, Craig R.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Private Bag 129, Hobart, Tas, Australia",9,10.1371/journal.pone.0174855,2017

To understand the dependence of this enhancement on skeleton meso-and macrostructure, we analysed the scattering abilities of naked coral skeletons for 74 Indo-Pacific species. Sensitive morphotypes to thermal and light stress, flat-extraplanate and branching corals, showed the most efficient structures, while massive-robust species were less efficient. The lowest light-enhancing scattering abilities were found for the most primitive colonial growth form: phaceloid. Accordingly, the development of highly efficient light-collecting structures versus the selection of less efficient but more robust holobionts to cope with light stress may constitute a trade-off in the evolution of modern symbiotic scleractinian corals, characterizing two successful adaptive solutions. The coincidence of the most important structural modifications with epitheca decline supports the importance of the enhancement of light transmission across coral skeleton in modern scleractinian diversification, and the central role of these symbioses in the design and optimization of coral skeleton. Furthermore, the same ability that lies at the heart of the success of symbiotic corals as coral-reef-builders can also explain the 'Achilles's heel' of these symbioses in a warming ocean.","[Enriquez, Susana; Iglesias-Prieto, Roberto] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limonol, Unidad Acad Sistemas Arrecifales Puerto Morelos, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Mendez, Eugenio R.] Ctr Invest Cient Educ Super Ensenada, Div Fis Aplicada, Carretera Ensenada Tijuana 3918, Ensenada 22860, BC, Mexico; [Hoegh-Guldberg, Ove] Univ Queensland, Global Change Inst, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Iglesias-Prieto, Roberto] Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, Mueller Lab 208, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",10,10.1098/rspb.2016.1667,2017

The concept of compensated trait loss posits that characters can be lost if a mutualistic relationship reduces the need for a given trait. Thus, selective pressures on escape performance might have relaxed in L. dimidiatus due to its privileged relationship with predators. However, the cost of failing to escape a predatory strike is extreme even if predation events on cleaners are exceptionally rare. Additionally, cleaners must escape from non-predatory clients that regularly punish them for eating mucus instead of parasites. Therefore, strong escape capabilities might instead be maintained in cleaner fish because they must be able to flee when in close proximity to predators or dissatisfied clients. We compared the fast-start escape performance of L. dimidiatus with that of five closely related wrasse species and found that the mutualistic relationship that cleaners entertain with predators has not led to reduced escape performance. Instead, conflicts in cleaning interactions appear to have maintained selective pressures on this trait, suggesting that compensated trait loss might only evolve in cases of high interdependence between mutualistic partners that are not tempted to cheat.","[Gingins, Simon; Roche, Dominique G.; Bshary, Redouan] Univ Neuchatel, Inst Biol, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland",2,10.1098/rspb.2016.2469,2017

However, such increased capability could also lead to analytical challenges if the methods used to examine these communities across local and global scales are not standardized. Here we compare and assess the underlying biases of four ARMS field processing methods, preservation media, and current bioinformatic pipelines in evaluating diversity from cytochrome c oxidase I metabarcoding data. Illustrating the ability of ARMS-based metabarcoding to capture a wide spectrum of biodiversity, 3,372 OTUs and twenty-eight phyla, including 17 of 33 marine metazoan phyla, were detected from 3 ARMS (2.607 m(2) area) collected on coral reefs in Mo'orea, French Polynesia. Significant differences were found between processing and preservation methods, demonstrating the need to standardize methods for biodiversity comparisons. We recommend the use of a standardized protocol (NOAA method) combined with DMSO preservation of tissues for sessile macroorganisms because it gave a more accurate representation of the underlying communities, is cost effective and removes chemical restrictions associated with sample transportation.

Multiple lines of evidence provide no support for the shared chemical defense hypothesis. Given the diversity of other potential food resources available to predators on coral reefs, it is improbable that the evolution of these specialized sponge-sponge symbioses has been driven by predation pressure.The recently described epizoic sponge-sponge symbioses between Xestospongia deweerdtae and two species of Plakortis present an unusual series of sponge interactions. Sponges from the genus Plakortis are fierce allelopathic competitors, rich in cytotoxic secondary metabolites, and yet X. deweerdtae flourishes as an epizoic encrustation on Plakortis deweerdtaephila and Plakortis symbiotica. Our objective in this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that X. deweerdtae grows epizoic to these two species of Plakortis due to a shared chemical defense against predators. We collected free-living individuals of X. deweerdtae and symbiotic pairs from a wide geographical range to generate crude organic extracts and a series of polarity fractions from sponge extract. We tested the deterrency of these extracts against three common coral reef predators: the bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum, the Caribbean sharpnose puffer, Canthigaster rostrata, and the white spotwrist hermit crab, Pagurus criniticornis. While the chemical defenses of P. deweerdtaephila and P. symbiotica are more potent than those of X. deweerdtae, all of the sponge species we tested significantly deterred feeding in all three generalist predators. The free-living form of X. deweerdtae is mostly defended across the region, with a few exceptions. The associated form of X. deweerdtae is always defended, and both species of Plakortis are very strongly defended, with puffers refusing to consume extract-treated pellets until the extract was diluted to 1/256x concentration. Using diode-array high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC) coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-MS/IT-TOF), we found two secondary metabolites from P. deweerdtaephila, probably the cyclic endoperoxides plakinic acid I and plakinic acid K, in low concentrations in the associated D but not the free-living D form of X. deweerdtae, suggesting a possible translocation of defensive chemicals from the basibiont to the epibiont. Comparing the immense deterrency of Plakortis spp. extracts to the extracts of X. deweerdtae gives the impression that there may be some sharing of chemical defenses: one partner in the symbiosis is clearly more defended than the other and a small amount of its defensive chemistry may translocate to the partner. However, X. deweerdtae effectively deters predators with its own defensive chemistry. Multiple lines of evidence provide no support for the shared chemical defense hypothesis. Given the diversity of other potential food resources available to predators on coral reefs, it is improbable that the evolution of these specialized sponge-sponge symbioses has been driven by predation pressure.","[Marty, Micah Jaarsma] Univ North Carolina Wilmington, Ctr Marine Sci, Dept Biol & Marine Biol, Wilmington, NC USA; [Vicente, Jan; Oyler, Benjamin L.; Place, Allen; Hill, Russell T.] Univ Maryland, Inst Marine & Environm Technol, Ctr Environm Sci, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA",2,10.1371/journal.pone.0174816,2017

When obligate coral-dwelling species die, the remaining species must either move or adjust to the altered conditions. Our goal was to investigate the effect of coral degradation on the ability of coral reef fishes to assess their risk of predation using alarm cues from injured conspecifics. Here, we tested the ability of six closely related species of juvenile damselfish (Pomacentridae) to respond to risk cues in both live coral or dead-degraded coral environments. Of those six species, two are exclusively associated with live coral habitats, two are found mostly on dead-degraded coral rubble, while the last two are found in both habitat types. We found that the two live coral associates failed to respond appropriately to the cues in water from degraded habitats. In contrast, the cue response of the two rubble associates was unaffected in the same degraded habitat. Interestingly, we observed a mixed response from the species found in both habitat types, with one species displaying an appropriate cue response while the other did not. Our second experiment suggested that the lack of responses stemmed from deactivation of the alarm cues, rather than the inability of the species to smell. Habitat preference (live coral versus dead coral associates) and phylogeny are good candidates for future work aimed at predicting which species are affected by coral degradation. Our results point towards a surprising level of variation in the ability of congeneric species to fare in altered habitats and hence underscores the difficulty of predicting community change in degraded habitats.","[Ferrari, Maud C.

Here we document an unprecedented hypoxic event on the Caribbean coast of Panama and assess the risk of dead zones to coral reefs worldwide. The event caused coral bleaching and massive mortality of corals and other reef-associated organisms, but observed shifts in community structure combined with laboratory experiments revealed that not all coral species are equally sensitive to hypoxia. Analyses of global databases showed that coral reefs are associated with more than half of the known tropical dead zones worldwide, with >10% of all coral reefs at elevated risk for hypoxia based on local and global risk factors. Hypoxic events in the tropics and associated mortality events have likely been underreported, perhaps by an order of magnitude, because of the lack of local scientific capacity for their detection.

Their sustainability is questioned in many places around the world as they experience combined effects of multiple chronic anthropogenic and natural drivers at local to global scales. From a management perspective, there is a crucial need to understand how the impact of these drivers cascade through the social-ecological system components. This study develops a transdisciplinary and participatory approach to investigating the social-ecological dynamics of a Polynesian coral reef coastal system. A preliminary conceptual model using the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact (DPSI) framework is first being built through participatory modeling workshops. Then, pressure-state relationships are assessed with the help of empirical datasets as a first step towards the validation of the DPSI model. Results shows striking social-ecological interactions with different patterns in the lagoon and in the fore reef. Local management should be: (1) less resource-focused to account more specifically to the existing typology of actors; (2) more spatially-explicit to better distinguish management objectives and actions for the lagoon and the fore reef sub-systems; and (3) more coordinated with terrestrial agencies for a coherent land-sea connection and integration that would both (i) account for existing land-sea interactions and (ii) better reflect the Polynesian cultural heritage that considers nature from ridge to reef as a whole. Such conceptual models of social-ecological systems are a useful tool to build exploratory scenarios to ultimately support planning decision-making processes.","[Leenhardt, Pierre; Pascal, Nicolas; Bambridge, Tamatoa; Clua, Eric; Feral, Francois; Salvat, Bernard; Claudet, Joachim] USR 3278 CNRS EPHE UPVD, CRIOBE, Natl Ctr Sci Res, Perpignan, France; [Stelzenmueller, Vanessa; Probst, Wolfgang Nikolaus] Thunen Inst Sea Fisheries TI, Palmaille 9, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany; [Pascal, Nicolas; Bambridge, Tamatoa; Clua, Eric; Feral, Francois; Quinquis, Bran; Salvat, Bernard; Claudet, Joachim] Lab Excellence CORAIL, Tahiti, French Polynesi, France; [Charles, Mahe] French Agcy Marine Protected Areas, Paris, France",3,10.1016/j.marpol.2017.01.014,2017

This, in turn, may result in greater fluctuations in recruitment of resources. In species in which offspring quality differs by female parent size, preserving differences and preventing limitations in female size among populations would be important. The effects of maternal factors on intraspecific variations in larval quality of the Kuruma prawn (Marsupenaeus japonicus) were analyzed by determining the relationships between larval variability (body size and resistance to starvation) and maternal variability (maternal body size, spawning timing, and maternal body condition) in the laboratory from June to October 2015. In addition, temporal variations in parental body size of fished M. japonicus stock were examined by field investigation for ten years between 1996 and 2010 in Bungo-suido Channel, Japan. Body size and starvation resistance of hatched larvae varied by spawning timing (spawning date) and corresponded with seasonal availability of food for larvae in the field. Larger females produced larger larvae with stronger starvation resistance. The mean size of harvested female prawns has decreased significantly over time. Stocks of M. japonicus with reduced mean female size would show reductions in intraspecific variations in quality and quantity of larvae at the population level, resulting from observed maternal influences and size-dependent female reproductive potential. If fishing activity reduces body size, marine reserves can be used as a possible management option.","[Sato, Taku; Hamano, Kaoru; Sugaya, Takuma; Dan, Shigeki] Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Natl Res Inst Fisheries & Environm Inland Sea, Res Ctr Marine Invertebrates, 1760 Momoshima, Onomichi, Hiroshima 7220061, Japan",3,10.1007/s00227-017-3118-9,2017

We used a reciprocal outplanting experiment with 930 corals representing ten genotypes on each of eight reefs to investigate the influence of genotype and the environment on growth and survivorship in the threatened Caribbean staghorn coral, Acropora cervicornis. Coral genotype and site were strong drivers of coral growth and individual genotypes exhibited flexible, non- conserved reaction norms, complemented by ten- fold differences in growth between specific G- E combinations. Growth plasticity may diminish the influence of local adaptation, where foreign corals grew faster than native corals at their home sites. Novel combinations of environment and genotype also significantly affected disturbance response during and after the 2015 bleaching event, where these factors acted synergistically to drive variation in bleaching and recovery. Importantly, small differences in temperature stress elicit variable patterns of survivorship based on genotype and illustrate the importance of novel combinations of coral genetics and small differences between sites representing habitat refugia. In this context, acclimatization and flexibility is especially important given the long lifespan of corals coping with complex environmental change. The combined influence of site and genotype creates shortterm differences in growth and survivorship, contributing to the standing genetic variation needed for adaptation to occur over longer timescales and the recovery of degraded reefs through natural mechanisms.","[Drury, Crawford; Lirman, Diego] Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Marine Biol & Ecol Div, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Manzello, Derek] NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Labs, Miami, FL USA",15,10.1371/journal.pone.0174000,2017

This can have negative consequences for the parental species involved (wasted reproductive effort), and has raised concerns for species conservation. This study evaluates the relative fitness of previously documented butterflyfish hybrids of the genus Chaetodon from the Indo-Pacific suture zone at Christmas Island. Histological examination confirmed the reproductive viability of Chaetodon hybrids. Examination of liver lipid content showed that hybrid body condition was not significantly different from parent species body condition. Lastly, size at age data revealed no difference in growth rates and asymptotic length between hybrids and parent species. Based on the traits measured in this study, naturally occurring hybrids of Chaetodon butterflyfishes have similar fitness to their parental species, and are unlikely to supplant parental species under current environmental conditions at the suture zone. However, given sufficient fitness and ongoing genetic exchange between the respective parental species, hybrids are likely to persist within the suture zone.","[Montanari, Stefano R.] James Cook Univ North Queensland, Coll Sci & Engn, Australian Inst Marine Sci, AIMS JCU, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Hobbs, Jean-Paul A.] Curtin Univ, Dept Environm & Agr, Bentley, WA, Australia; [Pratchett, Morgan S.] James Cook Univ North Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Bay, Line K.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [van Herwerden, Lynne] James Cook Univ North Queensland, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [van Herwerden, Lynne] James Cook Univ North Queensland, Ctr Comparat Genom, Townsville, Qld, Australia",2,10.1371/journal.pone.0173212,2017

It identifies the gaps and opportunities to integrate the existing long-term, short-term and compliance-related monitoring and reporting initiatives to provide the information for more effective and efficient (adaptive) management of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. And as importantly it aligns expectations among different agencies about how monitoring will inform management. Fifty two high priority values, processes and pressures for management were identified along with 65 existing monitoring programs. Developing the monitoring framework was useful in several ways. First it brought together scientists, policy- makers, managers, and other interested stakeholders with different agendas, philosophies and incentives and established a common purpose, lexicon and language for an integrated monitoring program. Second, it highlighted the importance and usefulness of qualitative conceptual models as a framework for focused discussion around a set of hypotheses with relevance for management. Third, the process started an important conversation about defining and setting a realistic number of monitoring priorities for management.

While many fish were collected, only a few were exported from India. The sea anemones were the major export as they were of a higher value in the international markets, largely attributed to their color patterns. Price discrepancies within the trade value of marine fishes and invertebrates used for the aquarium trade indicated that price increased approximately 200% at each transition in the value chain (collectors to wholesalers, wholesalers to retailers).

Exclusive local ownership of natural resources in Palau encourages adjustive management on biologically relevant scales of time and space and promotes responsibility by reducing the tragedy of the commons. The presence of large individuals in fish populations and adequate size of spawning aggregations are more efficient and meaningful cues for timely management than are surveys of abundance or biomass. Taking fish from populations more than halfway to their carrying capacity is working favorably with the fishery because removing fish potentially increases resource stability by negative feedback between stock size and population production. Taking the same amount of fish from a population below half its carrying capacity is working against the fishery, making the population unstable, because reducing the reproductive stock potentially accelerates reduction of the population production by positive feedback. Reef fish are consumed locally, while Palauan laws ban the export of reef resources. This is consistent with the high gross primary production with little excess net production from undisturbed coral-reef ecosystems. The relatively rapid growth rates, short life spans, reliable recruitment and wide-ranging movements of open-ocean fishes such as scombrids make them much more productive than coral-reef fishes. The greater fisheries yield per square kilometer in the open ocean multiplied by well over a thousand times the area of the exclusive economic zone than that of Palau's coral reefs should encourage Palauans to keep reef fishes for subsistence and to feed tourists open-ocean fishes. Fisheries having only artisanal means should be encouraged to increase the yield and sustainability by moving away from coral reefs to bulk harvesting of nearshore pelagics.","[Birkeland, Charles] Univ Hawaii, Dept Biol, 94-258 Olua Pl, Waipahu, HI 96797 USA",2,10.1007/s00338-016-1535-8,2017

Following the reef-building stony corals, octocorals are the second most common benthic component on many shallow reefs and a major component on deep reefs, the Red Sea included. This study is the first to examine octocoral community features on upper MCEs based on species-level identification and to compare them with the shallower reef zones. The study was carried out at Eilat (Gulf of Aqaba, northern Red Sea), comparing octocoral communities at two mesophotic reefs (30-45 m) and two shallow reef zones (reef flat and upper fore-reef) by belt transects. A total of 30 octocoral species were identified, with higher species richness on the upper MCEs compared to the shallower reefs. Although the MCEs were found to host a higher number of species than the shallower reefs, both featured a similar diversity. Each reef zone revealed a unique octocoral species composition and distinct community structure, with only 16% of the species shared by both the MCEs and the shallower reefs. This study has revealed an almost exclusive dominance of zooxanthellate species at the studied upper MCE reefs, thus indicating an adequate light regime for photosynthesis there. The findings should encourage similar studies on other reefs, aimed at understanding the spatiotemporal features and ecological role of octocorals in reef ecosystems down to the deepest limit of the MCEs.","[Shoham, Erez; Benayahu, Yehuda] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, Fac Life Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",7,10.1007/s00338-016-1528-7,2017

Whether or not elevated temperature affects sex determination depends on both the absolute temperature experienced and the stage of development at which the thermal conditions occur. We explored the importance of exposure timing during early development in the coral reef fish, Acanthochromis polyacanthus, by increasing water temperature 1.5 or 3 A degrees C above the summer average (28.5 A degrees C) at different stages of development. We also measured the effect of treatment temperature on fish size and condition, in order to gauge how the thermal threshold for sex-ratio bias may compare with other commonly considered physiological metrics. Increasing grow-out temperature from 28.5 to 30 A degrees C had no effect on the sex ratio of offspring, whereas an increase to 31.5 A degrees C (+3 A degrees C) produced a strong male bias (average similar to 90%). The thermosensitive period for this species lasted between 25 and 60 d post hatching, with the bias in sex ratio greater the earlier that fish experienced warm conditions. Temperatures high enough to bias the sex ratio are likely to be seen first during late summer (January and February) and would affect clutches produced late in the breeding season. There was no change to fish condition in response to temperature; however, the two higher temperature treatments produced significantly smaller fish at sampling. Clutches produced early in the season could buffer the population from a skewed sex ratio, as their development will remain below the thermal threshold; however, continued ocean warming could mean that clutches produced earlier in the breeding season would also be affected in the longer term. A skewed sex ratio could be detrimental to population viability by reducing the number of females in the breeding population.","[Rodgers, G.

However, in certain regions, the absence or scarcity of such habitats suggests that juvenile coral reef fish may be seeking refuge elsewhere. The underlying biogenic substratum of most coral reefs is structurally complex and provides many types of refuge. However, on young or subtropical coral reefs, species may be more reliant on the living coral layer as nursery areas. Such is the case on the high-latitude coral reefs of South Africa where the coral communities consist of a thin veneer of coral overlaying late Pleistocene bedrock. Thus, the morphology of coral species may be a major determinant in the availability of refuge space. Acropora austera is a branching species that forms large patches with high structural complexity. Associated with these patches is a diverse community of fish species, particularly juveniles. Over the past decade, several large (> 100 m(2)) A. austera patches at Sodwana Bay have been diminishing for unknown reasons and there is little evidence of their replacement or regrowth. Seven patches of A. austera (AP) and non-A. austera (NAP) were selected and monitored for 12 months using visual surveys to investigate the importance of AP as refugia and nursery areas. There were significant differences in fish communities between AP and NAP habitats. In total, 110 species were recorded within the patches compared to 101 species outside the patches. Labrids and pomacentrids were the dominant species in the AP habitats, while juvenile scarids, acanthurids, chaetodons and serranids were also abundant. The diversity and abundance of fish species increased significantly with AP size. As the most structurally complex coral species on the reefs, the loss of APs may have significant implications for the recruitment and survival of certain fish species.","[Floros, C.; Schleyer, M.

We manipulated the magnitude and timing of coral-reef fish settlement to investigate whether the competitive dominance of early-arriving Ambon damselfish (i.e., a priority effect) decreased in strength with increasing abundance of late-arriving lemon damselfish. Sequence of arrival had a stronger effect on survival than the number of competing individuals. Relative to when both species arrived simultaneously, lemon damselfish were less aggressive, avoided competitive interactions more frequently and experienced depressed survival when they arrived later than Ambon damselfish, with these effects occurring independently of lemon damselfish abundance. These results suggest priority effects are more important than colonizer abundance and should motivate the integration of priority effects into future studies of density dependence to determine their relative importance.","[Geange, Shane W.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington, New Zealand; [Geange, Shane W.] Dept Conservat, Wellington, New Zealand; [Poulos, Davina E.; McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, Dept Marine Biol & Aquaculture, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Stier, Adrian C.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",3,10.1007/s00338-016-1503-3,2017

Primary candidates for conservation in the region are the Scattered Islands (AZles Aeparses), a group of relatively pristine and uninhabited islands in the Mozambique Channel. However, while optimal conservation strategies depend on the degree of population connectivity among spatially isolated habitats, very few studies have been conducted in the area. Here, we use highly variable microsatellite markers from two damselfishes (Amphiprion akallopisos and Dascyllus trimaculatus) with differing life history traits [pelagic larval duration (PLD), adult habitat] to compare genetic structure and connectivity among these islands using classic population structure indices as well as Bayesian clustering methods. All classical fixation indexes F (ST), R (ST), G'(ST), and Jost's D show stronger genetic differentiation among islands for A. akallopisos compared to D. trimaculatus, consistent with the former species' shorter PLD and stronger adult site attachment, which may restrict larval dispersal potential. In agreement with these results, the Bayesian analysis revealed clear genetic differentiation among the islands in A. akallopisos, separating the southern group (Bassas da India and Europa) from the center (Juan de Nova) and northern (AZles Glorieuses) islands, but not for D. trimaculatus. Local oceanographic patterns such as eddies that occur along the Mozambique Channel appear to parallel the results reported for A. akallopisos, but such features seem to have little effect on the genetic differentiation of D. trimaculatus. The contrasting patterns of genetic differentiation between species within the same family highlight the importance of accounting for diverse life history traits when assessing community-wide connectivity, an increasingly common consideration in conservation planning.","[O'Donnell, James L.; Williams, Hannah E.; Bernardi, Giacomo] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Beldade, Ricardo; Mills, Suzanne C.] PSL Res Univ, EPHE, UPVD CNRS, CRIOBE,USR 3278, Papetoai Moorea 98729, Fr Polynesia; [Beldade, Ricardo; Mills, Suzanne C.] CORAIL, Lab Excellence, Moorea, France; [O'Donnell, James L.] Univ Washington, Sch Marine & Environm Affairs, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",4,10.1007/s00338-016-1495-z,2017

For most marine organisms, dispersal occurs primarily during a pelagic larval phase that connects populations. We paired population structure from comprehensive genetic sampling and biophysical larval transport modeling to describe how spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) population differentiation is related to biological oceanography. A total of 581 lobsters were genotyped with 11 microsatellites from ten locations around the greater Caribbean. The overall F (ST) of 0.0016 (P = 0.005) suggested low yet significant levels of structuring among sites. An isolation by geographic distance model did not explain spatial patterns of genetic differentiation in P. argus (P = 0.19; Mantel r = 0.18), whereas a biophysical connectivity model provided a significant explanation of population differentiation (P = 0.04; Mantel r = 0.47). Thus, even for a widely dispersing species, dispersal occurs over a continuum where basin-wide larval retention creates genetic structure.

The bathymetric difference between our DEM and the LiDAR dataset is -0.016 +/- 0.45 m (1 sigma). Our results show that it is possible, in conditions of calm waters, low winds and minimal sun glint, to deploy consumer-grade drones as a relatively low-cost and rapid survey technique to produce multispectral and bathymetric data on shallow-water coral reefs.

These super-abundant calcifiers are crucial to reef calcification by generation of lagoon and beach sands. Reef-scale carbonate production by LBFs is not well understood, and seasonal fluctuations in this important process are largely unquantified. The biomass of five LBF species in their algal flat habitat was quantified in the austral winter (July 2013), spring (October 2013), and summer (February 2014) at One Tree Reef. WorldView-2 satellite images were used to characterize and create LBF habitat maps based on ground-referenced photographs of algal cover. Habitat maps and LBF biomass measurements were combined to estimate carbonate storage across the entire reef flat. Total carbonate storage of LBFs on the reef flat ranged from 270 tonnes (winter) to 380 tonnes (summer). Satellite images indicate that the habitat area used by LBFs ranged from 0.6 (winter) to 0.71 km(2) (spring) of a total possible area of 0.96 km(2). LBF biomass was highest in the winter when algal habitat area was lowest, but total carbonate storage was the highest in the summer, when algal habitat area was intermediate. Our data suggest that biomass measurements alone do not capture total abundance of LBF populations (carbonate storage), as the area of available habitat is variable. These results suggest LBF carbonate production studies that measure biomass in discrete locations and single time points fail to capture accurate reef-scale production by not incorporating estimates of the associated algal habitat. Reef-scale measurements in this study can be incorporated into carbonate production models to determine the role of LBFs in sedimentary landforms (lagoons, beaches, etc.). Based on previous models of entire reef metabolism, our estimates indicate that LBFs contribute approximately 3.9-5.4% of reef carbonate budgets, a previously underappreciated carbon sink.","[Doo, Steve S.; Finfer, Joshua] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Coastal Marine Ecosyst Grp, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Hamylton, Sarah] Univ Wollongong, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Byrne, Maria] Univ Sydney, Sch Med Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Byrne, Maria] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",7,10.1007/s00338-016-1506-0,2017

Today, PAs cover c15% of the Earth's land mass and c3% of the global oceans. These numbers are expected to grow rapidly to meet the Convention on Biological Diversity's Aichi Biodiversity target 11, which aims to see 17% and 10% of terrestrial and marine biomes protected, respectively, by 2020. This target also requires countries to ensure that PAs protect an ""ecologically representative"" sample of their biodiversity. At present, there is no clear definition of what desirable ecological representation looks like, or guidelines of how to standardize its assessment as the PA estate grows. We propose a systematic approach to measure ecological representation in PA networks using the Protection Equality (PE) metric, which measures how equally ecological features, such as habitats, within a country's borders are protected. We present an R package and two Protection Equality (PE) measures; proportional to area PE, and fixed area PE, which measure the representativeness of a country's PA network. We illustrate the PE metrics with two case studies: coral reef protection across countries and ecoregions in the Coral Triangle, and representation of ecoregions of six of the largest countries in the world. Our results provide repeatable transparency to the issue of representation in PA networks and provide a starting point for further discussion, evaluation and testing of representation metrics. They also highlight clear shortcomings in current PA networks, particularly where they are biased towards certain assemblage types or habitats. Our proposed metrics should be used to report on measuring progress towards the representation component of Aichi Target 11. The PE metrics can be used to measure the representation of any kind of ecological feature including: species, ecoregions, processes or habitats.","[Chauvenet, Alienor L.

Anomalops katoptron produce striking blink patterns with symbiotic bacteria in their sub-ocular light organs. We examined the blink frequency in A. katoptron under various laboratory conditions. During the night A. katoptron swims in schools roughly parallel to their conspecifics and display high blink frequencies of approximately 90 blinks/minute with equal on and off times. However, when planktonic prey was detected in the experimental tank, the open time increased compared to open times in the absence of prey and the frequency decreased to 20% compared to blink frequency at night in the absence of planktonic prey. During the day when the school is in a cave in the reef tank the blink frequency decreases to approximately 9 blinks/minute with increasing off-times of the light organ. Surprisingly the non-luminescent A. katoptron with non-functional light organs displayed the same blink frequencies and light organ open/closed times during the night and day as their luminescent conspecifics. In the presence of plankton non-luminescent specimens showed no change in the blink frequency and open/closed times compared to luminescent A. katoptron.

On Indo-Pacific coral reefs, crown-of-thorns sea stars (Acanthaster spp.) are coral predators whose outbreaks cause precipitous coral decline. Across large spatial scales, Acanthaster densities are lower in large no-take Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and reefs subject to limited human exploitation. However, using a combination of observational and manipulative experiments, we found that Acanthaster densities within a network of small, no-take MPAs on reef flats in Fiji were similar to 2-3.4 times greater inside MPAs than in adjacent fished areas an similar to 2-2.5 times greater than the upper threshold density indicative of an outbreak. This appeared to result from selective Acanthaster migration to the coral-rich MPAs from fished areas that are coral-poor and dominated by macroalgae. Small MPAs can dramatically increase the cover of foundation species like corals, but may selectively attract coral predators like Acanthaster due to greater food densities within MPAs or because the MPAs are too small to support Acanthaster enemies. As coral cover increases, their chemical and visual cues may concentrate Acanthasterto outbreak densities that cause coral demise, compromising the value of small MPAs. An understanding of predator dynamics as a function of habitat type, size, and fragmentation needs to be incorporated into MPA design and management.","[Clements, Cody S.; Hay, Mark E.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",6,10.1371/journal.pone.0171569,2017

However, many of the world's reefs are declining, with Caribbean reefs suffering a significant decline in living corals over the past half century. This situation emphasizes the need to assess and monitor reef conditions using a variety of methods. In this study, a new method for assessing reef conditions to inform management using participatory mapping by coral reef ""experts"" in the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) is described. Occupational SCUBA divers were recruited (n=87) to map coral reef conditions, uses, and threats (stressors) using an internet-based mapping website. The data reveal an uneven geographic distribution of reef conditions in the USVI with the most frequently mapped perceived healthy reef characteristics being: large amount of physical reef structure (n=872 markers); endangered or threatened species present (n=721); and large amount of live coral cover (n=615). The greatest perceived threats were: invasive species (n=606); water pollution (n=234); and unsustainable fishing (n=200). Areas of important reef characteristics, perceived threats to reefs, and perceived recovery potential were plotted to identify areas requiring critical management attention. The authors found that perceptions of healthy reef conditions outnumbered perceptions of reef threats for nine of the ten most familiar coral reefs; the most frequent activity type within the coral reefs was tourism diving; and for the most familiar coral reefs, the divers perceived a high recovery potential. Given the novelty of participatory mapping methods to assess coral reefs, the strengths and weaknesses of the method is evaluated. The authors further propose a management typology for categorizing reef areas to inform their future management. In the absence of primary data, or, as a supplement to underwater surveys and remotely-sensed data on reef condition, participatory mapping can provide a cost-effective means for assessing coral reef conditions while identifying place-specific reef locations requiring management attention.","[Loerzel, Jarrod L.; Dillard, Maria K.] Natl Ocean Serv, Natl Ctr Coastal Ocean Sci, NOAA, Hollings Marine Lab, 331 Ft Johnson Rd, Charleston, SC 29412 USA; [Goedeke, Theresa L.] Natl Ocean Serv, Natl Ctr Coastal Ocean Sci, NOAA, Ctr Coastal Monitoring & Assessment, Bldg SSMC4,Room 9326,1305 East West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA; [Brown, Greg] Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Dillard, Maria K.] NIST, Engn Lab, Community Resilience Grp, 100 Bur Dr, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 USA; [Brown, Greg] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Nat Resources Management & Environm Sci, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA",2,10.1016/j.marpol.2016.11.003,2017

However, this information is lacking for many species, particularly in understudied and remote regions. With coral reefs continuing to face environmental pressures, insight into abundance and distribution patterns along with resource use of fish communities will aid in advancing our ecological understanding and management processes. Based on ecological surveys of hawkfish assemblages ( Family: Cirrhitidae) in the Red Sea, we reveal distinct patterns in the distribution and abundance across the continental shelf, wave exposure, and with depth, particularly in the four colour morphs of Paracirrhites forsteri. Distinct patterns were observed among hawkfishes, with higher abundance of all species recorded on reefs farther from shore and on wave exposed reef zones. Cirrhitus spilotoceps was only recorded on the exposed crest, but unlike the other species, did not associate with live coral colonies. Overall, the most abundant species was P. forsteri. This species exploited a variety of habitats but showed an affinity for complex habitats provided by live and dead coral colonies. No difference in habitat use was observed among the four colour morphs, but distinct patterns were apparent in distribution and abundance with depth.

Generally, well-managed and enforced MPAs can increase or maintain the diversity and function of the enclosed coral reef, with some of the benefits extending to adjacent nonprotected reefs. A fundamental question in coral reef conservation is whether these benefits arise within small MPAs (< 1 km(2)), because larval input of reef organisms is largely decoupled from local adult reproduction. We examined the structure of fish assemblages, composition of fish feeding groups, benthic cover, and key ecosystem processes (grazing, macroalgal browsing, and coral replenishment) in three small (0.5-0.8 km(2)) no-take MPAs and adjacent areas where fisheries are allowed (non-MPAs) on coral reefs in Fiji. The MPAs exhibited greater species richness, density, and biomass of fishes than non-MPAs. Furthermore, MPAs contained a greater abundance and biomass of grazing herbivores and piscivores as well as a greater abundance of cleaners than fished areas. We also found differences in fish associations when foraging, with feeding groups being generally more diverse and having greater biomass within MPAs than adjacent non-MPAs. Grazing by parrotfishes was 3-6 times greater, and macroalgal browsing was 3-5 times greater in MPAs than in non-MPAs. On average, MPAs had 260-280% as much coral cover and only 5-25% as much macroalgal cover as their paired non-MPA sites. Finally, two of the three MPAs had three-fold more coral recruits than adjacent non-MPAs. The results of this study indicate that small MPAs benefit not only populations of reef fishes, but also enhance ecosystem processes that are critical to reef resilience within the MPAs.","[Bonaldo, Roberta M.; Pires, Mathias M.; Guimaraes Junior, Paulo Roberto] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biociencias, Dept Ecol, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Bonaldo, Roberta M.; Hay, Mark E.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Bonaldo, Roberta M.; Hay, Mark E.] Georgia Inst Technol, Aquat Chem Ecol Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Hoey, Andrew S.] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia",9,10.1371/journal.pone.0170638,2017

Although we have some understanding of patterns of EAM sediments across individual reefs, our knowledge of patterns across broader spatial scales is limited. We used an underwater vacuum sampler to quantify patterns in two of the most ecologically relevant factors of EAM sediments across the Great Barrier Reef: total load and grain size distribution. We compare these patterns with rates of sediment production and reworking by parrotfishes to gain insights into the potential contribution of parrotfishes to EAM sediments. Inner-shelf reef EAMs had the highest sediment loads with a mean of 864.1 g m(-2), compared to 126.8 g m(-2) and 287.4 g m(-2) on mid-and outer-shelf reefs, respectively. High sediment loads were expected on inner-shelf reefs due to their proximity to the mainland, however, terrigenous siliceous sediments only accounted for 13-24% of total mass. On inner-shelf reef crests parrotfishes would take three months to produce the equivalent mass of sediment found in the EAM. On the outer-shelf it would take just three days, suggesting that inner-shelf EAMs are characterised by low rates of sediment turnover. By contrast, on-reef sediment production by parrotfishes is high on outer-shelf crests. However, exposure to oceanic swells means that much of this production is likely to be lost. Hydrodynamic activity also appears to structure sediment patterns at within-reef scales, with coarser sediments (> 250 mu m) typifying exposed reef crest EAMs, and finer sediments (< 250 mu m) typifying sheltered back-reef EAMs. As both the load and grain size of EAM sediments mediate a number of important ecological processes on coral reefs, the observed sediment gradients are likely to play a key role in the structure and function of the associated coral reef communities.","[Tebbett, Sterling B.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia; James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia",9,10.1371/journal.pone.0170854,2017

Coral bleaching and associated mortality events, which are predicted to become more frequent and intense, can alter the balance of different elements that are responsible for coral reef growth and maintenance. The geomorphic impacts of coral mass mortality have received relatively little attention, particularly questions concerning temporal recovery of reef carbonate production and the factors that promote resilience of reef growth potential. Here, we track the biological carbonate budgets of inner Seychelles reefs from 1994 to 2014, spanning the 1998 global bleaching event when these reefs lost more than 90% of coral cover. All 21 reefs had positive budgets in 1994, but in 2005 budgets were predominantly negative. By 2014, carbonate budgets on seven reefs were comparable with 1994, but on all reefs where an ecological regime shift to macroalgal dominance occurred, budgets remained negative through 2014. Reefs with higher massive coral cover, lower macroalgae cover and lower excavating parrotfish biomass in 1994 were more likely to have positive budgets post-bleaching. If mortality of corals from the 2016 bleaching event is as severe as that of 1998, our predictions based on past trends would suggest that six of eight reefs with positive budgets in 2014 would still have positive budgets by 2030. Our results highlight that reef accretion and framework maintenance cannot be assumed from the ecological state alone, and that managers should focus on conserving aspects of coral reefs that support resilient carbonate budgets.","[Januchowski-Hartley, Fraser A.; Perry, Chris T.] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Geog, Exeter, Devon, England; [Januchowski-Hartley, Fraser A.] Univ Montpellier 2, UM2, CNRS, UMR 248,MARBEC,UMR250,ENTROPIE,IRD,IFREMER,UM1, Montpellier, France; [Graham, Nicholas A.

We also recorded temperature, water level, tidal slope, tidal range, and mean wave height in both lagoons. Lower lagoon aperture and exposure to oceanic swells at Tatakoto than at Tubuai was responsible for lower lagoon water renewal, as well as higher variability in temperature and water level at Tatakoto across the studied period. These different environmental conditions had an impact on giant clams. Firstly, spawning events in the lagoon of Tatakoto, detected by gonad maturity indices in June and July 2014, were timed with high oceanic water inflow and a decrease in lagoon water temperature. Secondly, temperature explained differences in shell growth rates between seasons and lagoons, generating different growth curves for the two sites. Thirdly, local mortality rates were also found to likely be related to water renewal patterns. In conclusion, our study suggests that reef aperture and lagoon water renewal rates play an integral role in giant clam life history, with significant differences in rates of shell growth, mortality and fertility found between open versus semi-closed atoll lagoons in coral reef ecosystems.","[Van Wynsberge, Simon; Gaertner-Mazouni, Nabila; Menoud, Mathilde] Univ Polynesie Francaise, Lab Excellence CORAIL, UMR EIO 241, Lab Excellence CORAIL, Faaa, Tahiti, Fr Polynesia; [Van Wynsberge, Simon; Andrefouet, Serge] Univ Reunion, CNRS, Lab Excellence CORAIL, Inst Rech Dev,UMR 9220,ENTROPIE,Inst Rech Dev, Noumea, Nouvelle Caledo, Fr Polynesia; [Wabnitz, Colette C.

Aquarium based feeding trials were performed to assess how different sediment and organic loads affected feeding by the highly abundant surgeon fishes, Ctenochaetus striatus, a detritivore, and Acanthurus nigrofuscus, a herbivore. C. striatus were highly sensitive to even small increases in sediment loads (of just 75 g m(-2)), displaying a significant decline in feeding rates as sediment loads increased. Although C. striatus is a specialised detritivore, changing organic loads had no effect and suggests that selection of feeding surfaces is primarily mediated by total sediment loads rather than organic loads.

However, we lack empirical studies demonstrating the validity of key assumptions underpinning this concept, including that herbivorous fishes (1) are permanently resident within MR boundaries, (2) routinely consume the invasive algae of concern at significant levels and (3) are not significant mobile vectors for propagules of the invasive algae. A 46-year-old MR (Hawaii Marine Laboratory Refuge, 21 degrees 27'35 '' N, 157 degrees 48'15 '' W) in waters off Oahu provided a natural setting to examine these factors with the herbivorous bluespine unicornfish (Naso unicornis) and the invasive rhodophyte, Gracilaria salicornia. We acoustically tracked five unicornfish to quantify their residency and habitat use within the MR, conducted field and laboratory observations to confirm N. unicornis consume G. salicornia, and tested the viability of G. salicornia fragments recovered from unicornfish feces. Unicornfish were resident within the MR where they spent most time in reef crest habitat with occasional, brief forays into reef flat habitat. We confirmed unicornfish consume G. salicornia and found a significant positive correlation between algal canopy height and distance from the reef crest, presumably because grazing intensity is lower in less frequently utilized reef flat habitat. We demonstrated that unicornfish egest viable fragments of G. salicornia that resume vegetative growth after several weeks. We conclude that N. unicornis may act as both a natural control agent and a mobile vector for invasive alien algae.","[Bierwagen, Stacy L.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Price, Donald K.; Pack, Adam A.] Univ Hawaii, Trop Conservat Biol & Environm Sci Grad Program, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [Pack, Adam A.] Univ Hawaii, Dept Psychol, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [Meyer, Carl G.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI USA",3,10.1007/s00227-016-3049-x,2017

Fish densities were recordedin number and biomass. The biomass of M. acutirostris was inversely related to current fishing pressure, which did not affect the other two fishes. The density of E. marginatus increased with the island distance from one of the fishing villages, which indicated that past fishing may have had decreased the abundance of E. marginatus. Densities of the three fishes and fishing pressure did not differ between islands inside and outside the MPA. Data on fishing pressure, densities of groupers and coral cover were combined here to assign conservation scores to islands.

The data represented a wide range in bottom type, water depth, and illumination and supported more thorough investigations of remote sensing methods for identifying and mapping shallow reef features. The in situ data were used to compute spectral bottom reflectance and remote sensing reflectance, R-rs,R-lambda, as a function of water depth and benthic features. The signals were used to distinguish between live coral and uncolonized sediment within the depth range of the measurements (2.5-5 m). In situ R-rs,R-lambda were found to compare well with remotely sensed measurements from an imaging spectrometer, the Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), deployed on an aircraft at high altitude. Cloud cover and in situ sensor orientation were found to have minimal impact on in situ Rrs, suggesting that valid reflectance data may be collected using autonomous surveys even when atmospheric conditions are not favorable for remote sensing operations. The use of reflectance in the red and near infrared portions of the spectrum, expressed as the red edge height, REH lambda, was investigated for detecting live aquatic vegetative biomass, including coral symbionts and turf algae. The REH lambda, signal from live coral was detected in Kane'ohe Bay to a depth of approximately 4 m with in situ measurements. A remote sensing algorithm based on the REH lambda signal was defined and applied to AVIRIS imagery of the entire bay and was found to reveal areas of shallow, dense coral and algal cover. The peak wavelength of REH lambda decreased with increasing water depth, indicating that a more complete examination of the red edge signal may potentially yield a remote sensing approach to simultaneously estimate vegetative biomass and bathymetry in shallow water.","[Ackleson, Steven G.; Moses, Wesley J.] Naval Res Lab, Washington, DC 20375 USA; [Smith, Joseph P.; Rodriguez, Luis M.] US Naval Acad, Annapolis, MD 21402 USA; [Russell, Brandon J.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Marine Sci, Groton, CT 06340 USA",2,10.3389/fmars.2017.00325,2017

Changes in their photosynthetic efficiency were determined using pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) chlorophyll fluorescence. Despite an initial stress response, algae exposed to increases in thermal variation recovered within 24 hours, indicating a rapid, short-term acclimatization capacity. Algae naturally inhabiting thermally variable areas of the reef showed no change in photosynthetic efficiency throughout the study suggesting longer-term adaptation to living in a variable environment also occurs.

The most prolonged global bleaching event began in 2014 and continued into 2017 impacting more reefs than any previous occurrence.

Results from these surveys along with associated environmental factors were used to compare these events to gain a baseline understanding of the physical processes that influence localized bleaching dynamics under these extreme environmental conditions. Survey results show extensive variation in bleaching (1996-62%, 2014-45%, 2015-30%) and cumulative mortality (1996 <1%, 2014-13%, 2015-22%) between years. Bleaching prevalence was observed to decrease in certain reef areas across events, suggesting some acclimation and/or resilience, but possible increase susceptibility to mortality. Long-term monitoring sites show a similar temporal pattern of coral mortality and decline in coral cover, but revealed some reefs remained relatively un-impacted by consecutive high temperature events. Across the three bleaching events, we found that although circulation patterns can facilitate heating, the duration and magnitude of the high temperature event were the primary forcing functions for coral bleaching and mortality. Other localized primary drivers influencing water temperature such as irradiance, turbidity, and precipitation contributed to spatial variations. Recovery and resilience of this coral reef ecosystem is dependent on many factors including duration and magnitude of heating, resulting mortality levels, localized environmental factors in the bay, and coral species affected and their bleaching tolerances.","[Bahr, Keisha D.; Rodgers, Ku'ulei S.; Jokiel, Paul L.] Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96822 USA",3,10.3389/fmars.2017.00398,2017

In this paper, observations collected from 1996 to 2016 at Harrington Sound, Bermuda, constitute one of the longest time-series of coastal ocean inorganic carbon chemistry. Uniquely, such changes can be placed into the context of contemporaneous offshore changes observed at the nearby Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) site. Onshore, surface dissolved inorganic carbon (DIG) and partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2); >10% change per decade) have increased and OA indicators such as pH and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) saturation state (Omega) decreased from 1996 to 2016 at a rate of two to three times that observed offshore at BATS. Such changes, combined with reduction of total alkalinity over time, reveal a complex interplay of biogeochemical processes influencing Bermuda reef metabolism, including net ecosystem production (NEP = gross primary production-autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration) and net ecosystem calcification (NEC = gross calcification-gross CaCO3 dissolution). These long-term data show a seasonal shift between wintertime net heterotrophy and summertime net autotrophy for the entire Bermuda reef system. Over annual time-scales, the Bermuda reef system does not appear to be in trophic balance, but rather slightly net heterotrophic. In addition, the reef system is net accretive (i.e., gross calcification > gross CaCO3 dissolution), but there were occasional periods when the entire reef system appears to transiently shift to net dissolution. A previous 5-year study of the Bermuda reef suggested that net calcification and net heterotrophy have both increased. Over the past 20 years, rates of net calcification and net heterotrophy determined for the Bermuda reef system have increased by similar to 30%, most likely due to increased coral nutrition occurring in concert with increased offshore productivity in the surrounding subtropical North Atlantic Ocean. Importantly, this long-term study reveals that other environmental factors (such as coral feeding) can mitigate against the effects of ocean acidification on coral reef calcification, at least over the past couple of decades.","[Bates, Nicholas R.] Bermuda Inst Ocean Sci, St Georges, Bermuda; [Bates, Nicholas R.] Univ Southampton, Dept Ocean & Earth Sci, Natl Oceanog Ctr Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England",2,10.3389/fmars.2017.00036,2017

We studied how future ocean acidification (OA) will affect biotic and abiotic processes in sediments from two coral reefs of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. This was investigated in the laboratory under conditions where water-sediment exchange was dominated by molecular diffusion (Magnetic Island) or by porewater advection (Davies Reef). OA conditions (+Delta pCO(2): 170-900 mu atm, Delta pH: 0.1-0.4) did not affect photosynthesis, aerobic and anaerobic organic matter remineralization, and growth of microphytobenthos. However, microsensor measurements showed that OA conditions reduced the porewater pH. Under diffusive conditions these changes were limited to the upper sediment layers. In contrast, advective conditions caused a deeper penetration of low pH water into the sediment resulting in an earlier pH buffering by dissolution of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). This increased the dissolution of Davis Reef sediments turning them from net precipitating (-0.8 g CaCO3 m(-2) d(-1)) under ambient to net dissolving (1 g CaCO3 m(-2) d(-1)) under OA conditions. Comparisons with in-situ studies on other reef sediments show that our dissolution rates are reasonable estimates for field settings. We estimate that enhanced dissolution due to OA will only have a minor effect on net ecosystem calcification of the Davies Reef flat (<4%). However, it could decrease recent sediment accumulation rates in the lagoon by up to 31% (by 0.2-0.4 mm year(-1)), reducing valuable reef space. Furthermore, our results indicate that high-magnesium calcite is predominantly dissolving in the studied sediments and a drastic reduction in this mineral can be expected on Davis Reef lagoon in the near future, leaving sediments of an altered mineral composition. This study demonstrates that biotic sediment processes will likely not directly be affected by OA. Ensuing indirect effects of OA-induced sediment dissolution on biotic processes are discussed.","[Fink, Artur; den Haan, Joost; Chennu, Arjun; de Beer, Dirk] Max Planck Inst Marine Microbiol, Microsensor Grp, Bremen, Germany; [Uthicke, Sven] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia",0,10.3389/fmars.2017.00073,2017

Giant clams share the role of ecosystem engineers alongside corals in the Indo-Pacific, but overfishing has caused widespread local extinctions. Aquaculture reduces pressure on wild populations and captive bred juveniles have been used to restore extinct populations. However, giant clam restoration has not been attempted before with adults until now. A total of 150 captive bred, adult giant clams (Tridacna maxima), 4-10 years old, shell length 99-198 mm, were relocated to a healthy reef (control site) and a restored reef (treatment site) at a coral reef restoration project in Seychelles, Indian Ocean, in two sequential experiments. The first experiment started in April (calm season, NW Monsoon), deployed 30 clams, 15 per site at 12 m depth, and lasted 20 weeks. The second experiment started in June (rough season, SE Monsoon), deployed 120 clams, 60 per site at 6 and 12 m depth, and lasted 11 weeks. T maxima were measured and double tagged with glue-on shellfish tags prior to deployment. Survival was monitored weekly or biweekly depending on weather conditions. Remote GoPro video cameras confirmed the transplanted T maxima displayed normal behavior. Survival rates from Kaplan-Meier curves were 3.3-66.7%. Median survival time was 2 weeks to more than 20 weeks. T maxima survived 3.3-5 times longer at the treatment site than at the control site in both experiments. T maxima mortality was a combination of transplant season, predators, byssal re-attachment and wave swells. In the first experiment, mortality was due to octopus predation and 1.8 times higher at the control site than at the treatment site. The control site was an older reef with more octopus dens resulting in higher predation.

Many local management initiatives worldwide have been successfully managing aquatic resources and livelihoods of communities depending on them. Community-based management is particularly prevalent in small tropical islands where communities are frequently heavily dependent on coral reef ecosystems and small-scale reef fisheries for their livelihoods. Community based management is, however, not always a panacea since there are inherit tradeoffs among multiple objectives which are sometimes accentuated by community heterogeneity. It is well recognized that perceived and real evidence of community benefits are key to attributing success to local community-based management. However, broader understanding of community-based management objectives and how fishers' perceived personal objectives and characteristics affect management outcomes remains limited. We apply a non-linear Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to explore variations in personally held community-based management objectives, based on local surveys for fishing communities in the Kei Islands in Indonesia. We then examine whether these variations also explain their perceptions of environmental and economic outcomes that are achieved by this management systems. In this study important differences are found in the perceptions fishers have of the relative importance of different community management objectives. The value people attribute to aspects of community management can be related to their socio-demographic characteristics and experienced fishers tend to focus more on environmental objectives. Given that strong links were found between community management outcomes and terrestrially based activities there is an opportunity to link in the terrestrial and coastal systems management and achieve multiple objective outcomes.","[Hoshino, Eriko; van Putten, Elizabeth I.] Oceans & Atmosphere CSIRO, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Hoshino, Eriko; Yamazaki, Satoshi] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Sch Business & Econ, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [van Putten, Elizabeth I.; Yamazaki, Satoshi] Univ Tasmania, Ctr Marine Socioecol, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Girsang, Wardis] Univ Pattimura, Fac Agr, Ambon, Indonesia; [Resosudarmo, Budy P.] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Indonesia Project, Canberra, ACT, Australia",3,10.3389/fmars.2017.00141,2017

Alterations in the physical, chemical, and biological boundary controls may affect the stability of reef islands. Additionally, these factors are of importance in the context of future climate change. Such alterations through time may well be documented within the sedimentary record of reef islands and a better knowledge on its effects could help to improve our understanding of island responses to future changes of the status quo. However, detailed studies on the sedimentology and geomorphology of reef islands from southwest Sulawesi, Indonesia, are still rare. Here we report on the sedimentary composition and related facies zonation of four uninhabited coral reef islands in the Spermonde Archipelago. Sediment samples from onshore- and reef-flat environments were analyzed in regard to their grain size, component assemblages and facies distribution. Our results show that the analyzed island sediments are characterized by medium- to coarse-grained sand fractions and are well to poorly sorted. Across all islands examined, the surface sediment is predominately composed of materials identified as scleractinian coral and coralline red algae fragments, with minor additions from bivalves, gastropods and foraminifers. Importantly, statistical analyses of the variations in the percentage of these components allow for a clear sedimentary distinction of the four study sites into three outer shelf islands, situated closer to the open marine Makassar Strait, and one inner shelf island. On the inner shelf island, additional subsurface sedimentological analyses indicate a potential shift in major sediment contributors through time, preserved as coral-dominated accumulations within the subsurface samples, and coralline red algae-dominated deposits on top. These findings highlight the practical use of detailed sedimentological studies for the reconstruction of environmental changes in the Spermonde Archipelago.","[Janssen, Alexander] Ctr Marine Environm Sci, Bremen, Germany; [Janssen, Alexander; Wizemann, Andre; Klicpera, Andre; Westphal, Hildegard; Mann, Thomas] Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Res, Bremen, Germany; [Satari, Dewi Y.] Hasanuddin Univ, Res & Dev Ctr Marine Coastal & Small Isl, Makassar, Indonesia; [Westphal, Hildegard] Univ Bremen, Fac Geosci, Bremen, Germany",1,10.3389/fmars.2017.00144,2017

While experimental studies have identified ex situ taxon-specific responses to OA and global warming, isolating and connecting these effects in situ at the community-level has proved difficult. The difficulties arise from the large number of naturally varying parameters affecting corals reefs, such as light intensity and seawater residence time that affect net community production and calcification. To control variation in seawater residence time and allow light intensity to vary naturally, experimental outer reef (17-m depth) benthic communities composed of calcified algae, corals, and reef pavement were constructed in large outdoor flumes in Mo'orea, French Polynesia. Net community production (P), net community calcification (G), the ratio of P/G (P/G(ratio)), and slope of P regressed on G (P/G(slope)) were calculated for the communities, and concurrently for the constituent members under the same temperature, light, and flow conditions. P and G, for both the communities and constituent members, were correlated positively with light intensity, whereas P/G(rati)o and P/G(siope) were unaffected by light intensity. P/G(ratios) and P/G(siopes) exhibited values that were specific to each community member. These results suggest that the P/G(ratio) and P/G(slope) may be unaffected by natural variability in light intensity and could serve as useful metrics to relate responses at the taxon and community level, which is an important step in assessing the effects of environmental changes on coral reefs.","[Lantz, Coulson A.] Southern Cross Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Lismore, NSW, Australia; [Carpenter, Robert C.; Edmunds, Peter J.] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; [Comeau, Steeve] Univ Western Australia, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Ocean Inst, Sch Earth Sci, Cawley, WA, Australia",1,10.3389/fmars.2017.00298,2017

They have already caused significant ecological impacts and have the potential to affect local economies that depend on coral reefs. Snorkeling and scuba diving are important activities that rely on esthetically pleasant reefs. We asked whether lionfish-invaded reefs have lower esthetic value and whether fees to help control the invasion might be acceptable to recreational divers and snorkelers in the Mexican Caribbean. To do so, we conducted a choice experiment in which tourists were asked to indicate their preferences for coral reef images with varying attributes that can be affected by lionfish. We specified a priori two classes of respondents, i.e., snorkelers and divers, but two latent classes of recreational divers (casual vs. committed) emerged on the basis of their preferences. Tourist age, commitment to snorkeling/diving, and lionfish awareness explained class membership. Casual divers and snorkelers preferred reefs with lionfish and accepted their impacts on the reefs. In contrast, committed divers disliked lionfish and associated impacts, and would elect to dive elsewhere if such impacts were high. Casual divers and snorkelers preferred options with low lionfish control fees, while committed divers were willing to pay high fees. Our results indicate potential economic impacts of the lionfish invasion in regions that depend on reef-related tourism, and that lionfish control fees might be acceptable to some but not all recreational users. However, because all tourists favored to a greater extent reef features that can be affected detrimentally by lionfish than they favored lionfish themselves, we predict that managing the lionfish invasion should be beneficial to the local reef tourism industry.","[Malpica-Cruz, Luis; Smith, Nicola S.; Cote, Isabelle M.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Earth Ocean Res Grp, Burnaby, BC, Canada; [Malpica-Cruz, Luis] ECOCIMATI AC, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico; [Haider, Wolfgang; Fernandez-Lozada, Sergio] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, Burnaby, BC, Canada",0,10.3389/fmars.2017.00138,2017

H.",Modeling Larval Connectivity of Coral Reef Organisms in the Kenya-Tanzania Region,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,,"Most coral reef organisms have a bipartite life-cycle; they are site attached to reefs as adults but have pelagic larval stages that allow them to disperse to other reefs. Connectivity among coral reef patches is critical to the survival of local populations of reef organisms, and requires movement across gaps that are not suitable habitat for recruitment. Knowledge of population connectivity among individual reef habitats within a broader geographic region of coral reefs has been identified as key to developing efficient spatial management strategies to protect marine ecosystems. The study of larval connectivity of marine organisms is a complex multidisciplinary challenge that is difficult to address by direct observation alone. An approach that couples ocean circulation models with individual based models (IBMs) of larvae with different degrees of life-history complexity has been previously used to assess connectivity patterns in several coral reef regions [e.g., the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and the Caribbean]. We applied the IBM particle tracking approach to the Kenya-Tanzania region, which exhibits strong seasonality in the alongshore currents due to the influence of the monsoon. A 3-dimensional (3D) ocean circulation model with 2 km horizontal resolution was coupled to IBMs that track virtual larvae released from each of 661 reef habitats, associated with 15 distinct regions. Given that reefs provide homes to numerous species, each with distinctive, and in aggregate very diverse life-histories, several life-history scenarios were modeled to examine the variety of dispersal and connectivity patterns possible. We characterize virtual larvae of Acropora corals and Acanthurus surgeonfish, two coral reef inhabitants with greatly differing pelagic life-histories, to examine the effects of short (< 12 days) and long (>50 days) pelagic larval durations (PLD), differences in swimming abilities (implemented as reef perception distances), and active depth keeping in reef connectivity. Acropora virtual larvae were modeled as 3D passive particles with a precompetency period of 4 days, a total PLD of 12 days and a perception distance of 10 m. Acanthurus virtual larvae were characterized by 50 days precompetency period, a total PLD of 72 days and a perception distance of 4 km. Acanthurus virtual larvae were modeled in two ways as 3D passive particles and including an idealized ontogenetic vertical migration behavior. A range of distances within which larvae were able to perceive reefs and directionally swim to settle on them during the competency period were evaluated. The influence of interannual environmental variations was assessed for 2 years (2000, 2005) of contrasting physics. The spatial scale of connectivity is much smaller for the short PLD coral, with successful connections restricted to a 1 radius (similar to 100 km) around source reefs. In contrast, long distance connections from the southern to the northernmost reefs (similar to 950 km) are common for virtual Acanthurids. Successful settlement for virtual Acropora larvae was,0.3%, and within region settlement (local retention) was 0.38%, substantially greater than inter-region settlement (ca. 0.2%). Settlement of Acanthurus virtual larvae was 20% overall, with cross-region recruitment much increased compared to the coral larvae. Approximately 8% of Acropora larvae that successfully settled, recruited to their source reef (self-recruitment), an important proportion compared to only 1-2% self recruitment for Acanthurus. These rates and dispersal distances are similar to previous modeling studies of similar species in other coral reef regions and agree well with the few observational studies within the Kenya-Tanzania region.","[Mayorga-Adame, C.

We describe the relationships between planktonic community respiration (CR), net community production (NCR), gross primary production (GPP), and environmental variables in 14 regions and three ecosystem types (coastal, coral reef, and open sea) from Australia, Papua New Guinea, and Indonesia. The data are compiled from separate studies conducted between 2002 and 2014 with the goal of better parameterizing the metabolic balance in tropical marine waters. Overall, these regions were strongly autotrophic (average GPP:CR ratio: 2.14 +/- 0.98), though our dataset of 783 paired measurements did include some oceanic stations where heterotrophy (GPP:CR < 1) was predominant, and some coastal stations that were intermittently heterotrophic. Our statistical analysis suggested that temperature was the most important determinant of CR in coral reef and ocean ecosystems but less so in coastal ecosystems, where chlorophyll concentration was more important. In contrast, chlorophyll and sampling depth were more important in regulating GPP than temperature. The relationships between temperatures and metabolic rates showed that these were ecosystem-dependent, with coastal ecosystems showing less response to temperature than coral reef and open sea sites. The threshold of GPP to achieve metabolic balance fell in a range between 0.715 mmol O-2 m(-3) d(-1) in the Coral Sea to 10.052 mmol O-2 m(-3) d(-1) in mangrove waterways of Hinchinbrook Channel. These data allow regions in and around northern Australia to be ranked in terms of trophic state, ranging from the oligotrophic Scott Reef (GPP:CR = 0.84 +/- 0.08) to productive surface waters of the Kimberley coast (GPP:CR = 5.21 +/- 0.62).

One keystone species living in these shallow waters is the dugong (Dugong dugon). Officially fully protected under Indonesian Law (PP7/1999), published data on dugongs in the islands around Sulawesi are extremely limited. In this research, we collected, compiled and evaluated data and information (mostly unpublished) on the distribution, exploitation and community perceptions of dugongs around Sulawesi, including the Togean, Banggai, Spermonde, Taka Bone Rate/Selayar, and Tanakeke Islands. Opportunities for dugong conservation, and potential benefits for coral reef ecosystems in a small island socio-ecological context, were considered. Once common within living memory, socio-economic data indicate that Sulawesi dugongs are now rare and under severe threat. Many fishing communities consider dugong meat superior to beef, and see it as a welcome change from fish, while certain body parts fetch a high price, as do dugong tears. In the Spermonde Islands, dugongs may already have been extirpated; the most recent reported sighting was in 1993 when the capture of an adult dugong by fishermen of Barranglompo Island resulted in an impromptu festival. All these Sulawesi small islands communities have dugong princess (putri duyung) legends with potential as an entry-point to hearts and minds.

In contrast, bleaching impacts on nearshore turbid-zone reefs, traditionally considered more ""marginal"" coral habitats, remain poorly documented. This is because rapid ecological surveys are difficult in these turbid water settings, and baseline coral community data from which to quantify disturbance are rare. However, models suggest that the extreme environmental conditions characteristic of nearshore settings (e.g., fluctuating turbidity, light, and temperature) may acclimate corals to the thermal anomalies associated with bleaching on offshore reefs, although validation by field evidence has to-date been sparse. Here we present a novel pre- (June 2013/2014) and post-warming (August 2016) assessment of turbid-zone coral communities and examine the response of corals to prolonged and acute heat stress within the Paluma Shoals reef complex, located on the central GBR. Our analysis of 2,288 still video frames (similar to 1,200 m(2)) which include 11,374 coral colonies (24 coral genera) suggest a high tolerance of turbid-zone corals to bleaching, with no significant changes in coral cover (pre: 48 +/- 20%; post: 55 +/- 26%) or coral community structure (e.g., Acropora, Montipora, Turbinaria, Porites) following the warming event. Indeed, only one coral colony (Lobophyllia sp.) exhibited full colony bleaching, and just 1.5% of colonies displayed partial pigmentation loss (<20% colony surface). Taxa-specific responses to this thermal stress event contrast with clear-water assessments, as Acropora corals which are normally reported as highly susceptible to bleaching on clear-water reefs were least impacted at Paluma Shoals, a phenomena that has been observed within other turbid settings. Importantly, field surveys confirm regional SSTs were sufficiently high to induce coral bleaching (i.e., comparable number of degree heating days in nearshore and offshore areas), but bleaching severity was much higher at central GBR offshore sites. A more optimistic outlook than is generally offered for nearshore reefs on the central GBR may be implied by our results, which highlights the importance of these resilient but often overlooked coral reef habitats as potential refugia during climate-related disturbances.","[Morgan, Kyle M.; Perry, Chris T.; Johnson, Jamie A.] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Sch Geog, Exeter, Devon, England; [Smithers, Scott G.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia",12,10.3389/fmars.2017.00224,2017

High demand and a lack of enforcement of existing fisheries regulations turn into high pressure for the coral reef ecosystem, contributing to its overall degradation. Estimations on the ecological impacts of different levels of fishing pressure, as well as fisheries stock assessments and marine resource management require precise information of the spatial distribution of fishing effort, which involves great uncertainty when only anecdotal information is considered. We explored the feasibility of applying participatory boat tracking to complement fisheries data during the NW monsoon season 2014-2015. We conducted interviews, measured catch landings, and distributed GPS data loggers among hook and line fishermen to identify fishing grounds by gear-dependent patterns of boat movement. Most of the fishing activities involved two gears (octopus bait and trolling line for live groupers) and three fishing grounds. The mass of catch landings was dominated by Octopoda (CPUE = 10.1 kg boatday(-1)) while the most diverse group was the fish family Serranidae, with Plectropomus leopardus being the main target species. In conclusion, boat tracking combined with interviews and catch surveys has proven a useful tool to reduce uncertainty in information on spatial resource use, while allowing a high level of participation by fishermen.","[Navarrete Forero, Gabriela] Escuela Super Politecn Litoral ESPOL, Fac Ciencias Vida, Ctr Agua & Desarrollo Sustentable, Guayaquil, Ecuador; [Minarro, Sara; Reuter, Hauke] Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Res ZMT, Dept Theoret Ecol & Modelling, Bremen, Germany; [Minarro, Sara] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol ICTA, Bellaterra, Spain; [Mildenberger, Tobias Karl] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, Sect Ecosyst Based Marine Management, Lyngby, Denmark; [Breckwoldt, Annette] Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Res ZMT, Dept Social Sci, Bremen, Germany; [Breckwoldt, Annette] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Sci Stakeholder Interact Proc, Alfred Wegener Inst, Bremerhaven, Germany; [Sudirman] Hasanuddin Univ, Fac Marine Sci & Fisheries, Dept Fisheries, Makassar, Indonesia; [Reuter, Hauke] Univ Bremen, Fac Biol & Chem, Bremen, Germany",1,10.3389/fmars.2017.00409,2017

Major land use alteration at steep, highly erodible semi arid islands accelerates the potential of soil erosion, runoff, and sedimentation stress to nearshore coral reefs during extreme rainfall events. The goal of this study was to assess spatio-temporal variation of sedimentation dynamics across nearshore coral reefs as a function of land use patterns, weather and oceanographic dynamics, to identify marine ecosystem conservation strategies. Sediment was collected at a distance gradient from shore at Bahia Tamarindo (BTA) and Punta Soldado (PSO) coral reefs at Culebra Island, Puerto Rico. Sediment texture and composition were analyzed by dry sieving and loss-on-ignition techniques, and were contrasted with environmental variables for the research period (February 2014 to April 2015). Rainfall and oceanographic data were analyzed to address their potential role on affecting sediment distribution with BEST BIO-ENV, RELATE correlation, and linear regression analysis. A significant difference in sedimentation rate was observed by time and distance from shore (PERMANOVA, p < 0.0100), mostly attributed to higher sediment exposure at reef zones closer to shore due to strong relationships with coastal runoff. Sedimentation rate positively correlated with strong rainfall events (Rho = 0.301, p = 0.0400) associated with storms and rainfall intensity exceeding 15 mm/h. At BTA, sediment deposited were mostly composed of sand, suggesting a potential influence of resuspension produced by waves and swells. In contrast, PSO sediments were mostly composed of silt-clay and terrigenous material, mainly attributed to a deforestation event that occurred at adjacent steep sub watershed during the study period. Spatial and temporal variation of sedimentation pulses and terrigenous sediment input implies that coral reefs exposure to sediment stress is determined by local land use patterns, weather, and oceanographic dynamics. Comprehensive understanding of sediment dynamics and coastal ecosystem interconnectivity is fundamental to implement integrated and adaptive management strategies aimed to promote sustainable development at watershed and island wide-scale to fully mitigate terrigenous sediment impact to marine ecosystems. Furthermore, decision-making processes and policy needs to address sedimentation stress in the context of future climate to reduce land-based threats and strengthen coral reef resilience.","[Otano-Cruz, Abimarie; Hernandez-Figueroa, Elix M.; Hernandez-Delgado, Edwin A.] Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Environm Sci, San Juan, PR 00936 USA; [Otano-Cruz, Abimarie; Hernandez-Figueroa, Elix M.; Hernandez-Delgado, Edwin A.] Univ Puerto Rico, Coral Reef Res Grp, Ctr Appl Trop Ecol & Conservat, San Juan, PR 00936 USA; [Otano-Cruz, Abimarie; Montanez-Acuna, Alfredo A.; Torres-Lopez, Valeria; Hernandez-Delgado, Edwin A.] Soc Ambiente Marino, San Juan, PR 00931 USA; [Hernandez-Delgado, Edwin A.] Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Biol, San Juan, PR 00936 USA",0,10.3389/fmars.2017.00249,2017

Ocean warming and acidification will alter rates of benthic reef metabolism (i.a, primary production, respiration, calcification, and CaCO3 dissolution), but our understanding of community and ecosystem level responses is limited in terms of functional, spatial, and temporal scales. Furthermore, dramatic changes in coral cover and benthic metabolism could alter seawater carbonate chemistry on coral reefs, locally alleviating or exacerbating OA. This study examines how benthic metabolic rates scale with changing coral cover (0-100%), and the subsequent influence of these coral communities on seawater carbonate chemistry based on mesocosm experiments in Bermuda and Hawaii. In Bermuda, no significant differences in benthic metabolism or seawater carbonate chemistry were observed for low (40%) and high (80%) coral cover due to large variability within treatments. In contrast, significant differences were detected between treatments in Hawaii with benthic metabolic rates increasing with increasing coral cover. Observed increases in daily net community calcification and nighttime net respiration scaled proportionally with coral cover. This was not true for daytime net community organic carbon production rates, which increased the most between 0 and 20% coral cover and then less so between 20 and 100%. Consequently, diel variability in seawater carbonate chemistry increased with increasing coral cover, but absolute values of pH, Omega(a), and pCO(2) were not significantly different during daytime. To place the results of the mesocosm experiments into a broader context, in situ seawater carbon dioxide (CO2) at three reef sites in Bermuda and Hawaii were also evaluated; reefs with higher coral cover experienced a greater range of diel CO2 levels, complementing the mesocosm results. The results from this study highlight the need to consider the natural complexity of reefs and additional biological and physical factors that influence seawater carbonate chemistry on larger spatial and longer temporal scales.

Despite this, understanding of habitat specific budget states, how these scale across reef platforms, and our ability to quantify both framework and sediment production values remains limited. Here, we use in-situ census data from an atoll rim reef platform in the central Maldives to quantify rates of both reef framework and sediment production and loss within different platform habitats, and then combine these data with high-resolution habitat maps to quantify contributions to platform wide carbonate budgets. The net reef framework budget for the entire platform is extremely low (0.12 G, where G = Kg CaCO3 m(-2) year with a very high proportion (143,745 kg or 65.1%) of total framework production generated within the platform margin reef zones, despite these comprising only 8% of platform area. Net platform-scale sediment budgets are higher (1.04 G), but most is produced in the reef and platform margin hardground habitats, of which 80% derives from parrotfish bioerosion. Significant quantities of new sediment (up to 1 G derived from the calcareous green algae Halimeda) are produced only in one habitat. All lagoonal habitats have negative or neutral net carbonate budgets. These data demonstrate the marked inter-habitat differences in reef carbonate budgets that occur across reef platforms, and the major dampening effect on overall platform scale budgets when rates are factored for habitat type and size. Furthermore, the data highlights the disproportionately important role that relatively small areas of reef habitat can have on the maintenance of net positive platform scale budgets. Because of the intrinsic link between carbonate production rates and reef-associated landform development and maintenance, these findings also have implications for understanding reef-associated landform stability. In this context the reef island at this site has been highly mobile over the last 40 years, and we hypothesize that such instability may be being exacerbated by the measured low overall rates of framework and sediment generation.","[Perry, Chris T.; Morgan, Kyle M.; Yarlett, Robert T.] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Geog, Exeter, Devon, England",3,10.3389/fmars.2017.00185,2017

Habitat suitability modeling is being used increasingly to predict distribution patterns of VME indicator taxa in the deep sea, where data are particularly sparse, and the models are considered useful for marine ecosystem management. The Louisville Seamount Chain is located within the South Pacific Regional Fishery Management Organization (SPRFMO) Convention Area, and some seamounts are the subject of bottom trawling for orange roughy by the New Zealand fishery. The aim of the present study was to produce high-resolution habitat suitability maps for VME indicator taxa and VME habitat on these seamounts, in order to evaluate the feasibility of designing within-seamount spatial closures to protect VMEs. We used a multi-model habitat suitability mapping approach, based on bathymetric and backscatter data collected by multibeam echo sounder survey, and data collected by towed underwater camera for the stony coral and habitat forming VME indicator species Solenosmilia variabilis. as well as two taxa indicative of stony coral habitat (Brisingida, Crinoidea). Model performance varied among the different model types used (Boosted Regression Tree, Random Forest, Generalized Additive Models), but abundance-based models consistently out-performed models based on presence-absence data. Uncertainty for ensemble models (combination of all models) was lower overall compared to the other models. Maps resulting from our models showed that suitable habitat for S. variabilis is distributed around the summit slope break of seamounts, and along ridges that extend down the seamount flanks. Only the flat, soft sediment summits are predicted to be unsuitable habitat for this stony coral species. We translated a definition for stony coral-reef habitat into a S. variabilis abundance-based threshold in order to use our models to map this VME habitat. These maps showed that coral-reef occurred in small and isolated patches, and that most of the seabed on these seamounts is predicted to be unsuitable habitat for this VME. We discuss the implications of these results for spatial management closures on the Louisville Seamount Chain seamounts and the wider SPRFMO area, and future modeling improvements that could aid efforts to use habitat suitability maps for managing the impact of fishing on VMEs.","[Rowden, Ashley A.; Anderson, Owen F.; Bowden, David A.; Clark, Malcolm R.; Pallentin, Arne] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Wellington, New Zealand; [Georgian, Samuel E.] Marine Conservat Inst, Seattle, WA USA; [Miller, Andrew] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Christchurch, New Zealand",2,10.3389/fmars.2017.00335,2017

The southern Arabian Gulf is a thermally extreme environment, providing an opportunity to study fish diets on reefs with summer temperatures representative of next-century conditions elsewhere. Using 18S metagenomic analyses of stomach contents, we provide the first description of the dietary composition of three abundant reef fishes (Pomacanthus rnaculosus, Pomacentrus aquilus, and Pomacentrus trichrourus) from the thermally extreme southern Arabian Gulf, with five sampling periods across 1 year used to assess seasonal variation in diet. In total, 146 stomach content samples were sequenced, resulting in 9.6 million filtered reads that aligned to 17 classes in 14 phyla. Corals (Cnidaria, Anthozoa) dominated stomach contents of all three fishes (overall mean: 74.6, 40.6, and 21.2% of stomach reads, respectively), suggesting coral consumption to be characteristic of reef fish diet in the region. Sanger sequencing validated the presence of corals in the stomach contents and identified two common genera in the region, Porites and Platygyra, as part of the diet. Other common phyla included sponges and annelid worms (P maculosus: 14.9%, 4.1%; 0 aquilus: 5.9%, 16.7%; P trichrourus: 8.2%, 14.7%, respectively), with the remainder comprised of 11 other phyla. Algae were virtually absent in diets of all three species. The P maculosus diet was consistently coral/sponge dominated across the year, but there was substantial seasonal variation in the damselfishes, with diets dominated by coral in the hottest month (August; P. aquilus: 89.4%, P trichrourus: 51.5%) but broadest in spring (March, May) when corals became less common (<19.8% each) and bivalves, free living ascidians, and various arthropods increased; parasitic cestodes were also abundant in damselfish stomachs in spring (mean: >16.4%). These results suggest that these fishes have developed a feeding ecology responsive to the fluctuating and extreme environmental conditions of their region. These results broaden our understanding of the diets of these three species and document the nature, complexity and temporal dynamics of reef fish diets in the most thermally extreme coral reef environment on earth.","[Shraim, Rasha; Dieng, Mame M.; Vinu, Manikandan; Vaughan, Grace; McParland, Dain; Idaghdour, Youssef; Burt, John A.] New York Univ Abu Dhabi, Biol Program, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates",0,10.3389/fmars.2017.00285,2017

To provide such information for managers in Hawaii, USA, a numerical circulation model was developed to determine the role of ocean currents in transporting coral larvae from natal reefs throughout the high volcanic islands of the Maui Nui island complex in the southeastern Hawaiian Archipelago. Spatially- and temporally-varying wind, wave, and circulation model outputs were used to drive a km-scale, 3-dimensional, physics based circulation model for Maui Nui. The model was calibrated and validated using satellite-tracked ocean surface current drifters deployed during coral-spawning conditions, then used to simulate the movement of the larvae of the dominant reef-building coral. Porites compressa, from 17 reefs during eight spawning events in 2010-2013. These simulations make it possible to investigate not only the general dispersal patterns from individual coral reefs, but also how anomalous conditions during individual spawning events can result in large deviations from those general patterns. These data also help identify those reefs that are dominated by self-seeding and those where self-seeding is limited to determine their relative susceptibility to stressors and potential roadblocks to recovery. Overall, the numerical model results indicate that many of the coral reefs in Maui Nui seed reefs on adjacent islands, demonstrating the interconnected nature of the coral reefs in Maui Nui and providing a key component of the scientific underpinning essential for the design of a mutually supportive network of MPAs to enhance conservation of coral reefs.","[Storlazzi, Curt D.] US Geol Survey, Pacific Coastal & Marine Sci Ctr, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [van Ormondt, Maarten] Deltares, Dept Marine & Coastal Syst, Delft, Netherlands; [Chen, Yi-Leng] Univ Hawaii, Meteorol Dept, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Elias, Edwin P.

Although geographic distances may be short, it is still unclear if such environments are inhabited evenly with panmictic conditions or if limited connectivity between marine populations, even on small geographic scales, leads to genetic differentiation between areas within the archipelago or even single reef structures. To study diversity patterns and connectivity between reefs of the Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia, population genetic analyses of two reef organisms were performed by using the mitochondrial control region and microsatellite markers. A vertebrate (clown anemonefish) and an invertebrate species (sea squirt) were studied in parallel to investigate if there are general patterns of connectivity in Spermonde for sessile or site attached marine species, which can be extrapolated to a larger group. The genetic population structures revealed restrictions in gene flow in the clown anemone fish (Amphiprion ocellaris), especially between near-shore reefs in the South of the archipelago. This indicates very localized genetic exchange and may also reflect the high self-recruitment typical for these fish. The northern reefs show higher connectivity despite geographic distances being larger. The filter-feeding sessile sea squirt, Polycarpa aurata, features similar population patterns, especially in the southern area. However, connectivity is generally higher in the middle and shelf edge areas of Spermonde for this species. The results underline that there are restrictions to gene flow even on very small geographic scales in the studied organisms, with many barriers to gene flow in the southern shallower shelf area. Weaker currents in this area may lead to more influence of biological factors for dispersal, such as larval behavior, motility and competition for suitable habitat. The results are discussed in the context of conservation and MPA planning in the Spermonde Archipelago.","[Timm, Janne] Univ Bremen, Ctr Environm Res & Sustainable Technol UFT, Biotechnol & Mol Genet, Bremen, Germany; [Kochzius, Marc; Neuhaus, Anouk I.] Vrije Univ Brussel, Marine Biol, Brussels, Belgium; [Madduppa, Hawis H.] Bogor Agr Univ, Marine Sci & Technol, Bogor, Indonesia; [Dohna, Tina] Univ Bremen, Marum Ctr Marine Environm Sci, Bremen, Germany",3,10.3389/fmars.2017.00294,2017

Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) were used to collect geoacoustic data of these leeward reefs at multiple sites as part of an ocean exploration project. AUV swath bathymetry and side-scan sonar data were analyzed for depth, acoustic backscatter intensity, seafloor slope, and rugosity. These geomorphic metrics were then used as inputs to generate a composite synthetic index of bottom-type to delineate MCE features. A confusion matrix statistical analysis of the acoustic class map showed an overall accuracy of the acoustic classes at 66%, with accuracy of the hard coral class the highest at 83%, and the sandy-bottom class the lowest at 55.

The resultant carbonate structure is key for explaining their ecological success, as it provides protection against herbivores and resistance to water motion. However, its potential contribution to enhance thallus light absorption efficiency through multiple light scattering on algal skeleton, similar to the effect documented for scleractinian corals, has not been yet investigated. Here, we initiate this analysis, characterizing thallus optical properties of three coralline species, which differed in pigment content and thallus mass area (TMA, gDW m(-2)). The three species, the rhodolith Neogoniolithon sp., the crustose coralline alga (CCA), Lithothamnion sp., and the articulated alga Arnphiroa tribulus, represent the more distinctive coralline growth-forms and are able to colonize contrasting light environments in Caribbean coral reefs. The thicker thalli of the rhodoliths were the most efficient light collectors, as evidenced by their higher pigment absorption efficiency (a*(chia); m(2) mgChla(-1)) and photosynthetic rates per unit area. This could explain rhodolith success in oligotrophic, highly illuminated reef environments. In contrast, the thinner thalli of the CCA, a low-light specialist, showed the highest metabolic rates normalized to mass and the highest light absorption efficiencies per unit mass (a*(m); m(2) gdw(-1)). Therefore, the ecological success of the CCA in cryptic habitats within the reef cannot be explained only by its low-light physiology, but also by its capacity to reduce the structural costs of their thalli, and thus of its new growth. Lastly, the ecological success of Amphiroa tribulus, which displayed intermediate values for the efficiency of light absorption, metabolic rates and TMA, was explained by its ability to construct the largest light collectors (algal canopies) thanks to the presence of flexible, non-calcified segments (genicula). This ability enables enhanced photosynthetic and carbonate production at the organism/canopy level. The resulting fragile canopy survives best within the protection provided by colonies of the lettuce coral Agaricia agaricites. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the utility of optical traits as powerful tools to investigate differences in the competitive abilities, abundances and niche distribution among algal species and/or growth-forms.","[Vasquez-Elizondo, Roman M.; Enriquez, Susana] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Unidad Sistemas Arrecifales Puerto Morelos, Lab Fotobiol, Cancun, Mexico",0,10.3389/fmars.2017.00297,2017

C.; de Bakker, Didier M.; van Duyl, Fleur C.; Reichart, Gert-Jan; de Nooijer, Lennart J.",Combined Effects of Experimental Acidification and Eutrophication on Reef Sponge Bioerosion Rates,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,,"Health of tropical coral reefs depends largely on the balance between constructive (calcification and cementation) and destructive forces (mechanical-chemical degradation). Gradual increase in dissolved CO2 and the resulting decrease in carbonate ion concentration (""ocean acidification"") in ocean surface water may tip the balance toward net mass loss for many reefs. Enhanced nutrients and organic loading in surface waters (""eutrophication""), may increase the susceptibility of coral reef and near shore environments to ocean acidification. The impacts of these processes on coral calcification have been repeatedly reported, however the synergetic effects on bioerosion rates by sponges are poorly studied. Erosion by excavating sponges is achieved by a combination of chemical dissolution and mechanical chip removal. In this study, Dona caribbaea, a photosymbiont-bearing excavating sponge widely distributed in Caribbean reef habitats, was exposed to a range of CO2 concentrations, as well as different eutrophication levels. Total bioerosion rates, estimated from changes in buoyant weights over 1 week, increased significantly with pCO(2) but not with eutrophication. Observed chemical bioerosion rates were positively affected by both pCO(2) and eutrophication but no interaction was revealed. Net photosynthetic activity was enhanced with rising pCO(2) but not with increasing eutrophication levels. These results indicate that an increase in organic matter and nutrient renders sponge bioerosion less dependent on autotrophic products. At low and ambient pCO(2), day-time chemical rates were 50% higher than those observed at night-time. A switch was observed in bioerosion under higher pCO(2) levels, with night-time chemical bioerosion rates becoming comparable or even higher than day-time rates. We suggest that the difference in rates between day and night at low and ambient pCO(2) indicates that the benefit of acquired energy from photosynthetic activity surpasses the positive effect of increased pCO(2) levels at night due to holobiont respiration. This implies that excavation must cost cellular energy, by processes, such as ATP usage for active Ca2+ ancVor active proton pumping. Additionally, competition for dissolved inorganic carbon species may occur between bioerosion and photosynthetic activity by the symbionts. Either way, the observed changing role of symbionts in bioerosion can be attributed to enhanced photosynthetic activity at high pCO(2) levels.","[Webb, Alice E.; van Heuven, Steven M. A.

To date, coral recruitment success rates are poorly quantified because survey methods are labor-intensive and require manual interpretation. Thus, they are prone to human errors and have low repeatability-a gap we aim to bridge in this research. Since both corals and their symbiotic algae contain fluorescent pigments (chlorophyll and fluorescent proteins), we used the non-invasive Fluorescence Imaging System (FluorlS) and developed a methodology to acquire daytime fluorescent photographs and identify coral recruits in them. We tested our method by monitoring 20 random quadrats at two sites in the Gulf of Aqaba, Israel. The quadrats were surveyed once a month for 8 months in order to track the settlement, mortality and survival rates of new coral recruits. We demonstrate daytime imaging using our method and identification of coral recruits as small as 1 mm in diameter, in a 20 x 20 cm quadrat. Our results show that this photographic method reduces surveyor errors and improves precision. The surveys revealed that on average, there are similar to 2 new coral recruit settlements (<2 cm) for a quadrat (40 cm(2)) per month and that 83% of them survive the first month. Our study suggests a relative stability in the Gulf of Aqaba coral population during the survey period. The ability to survey recruits during the day using low-cost, easy-to-use photographic equipment has the potential to contribute significantly to the standardization of coral reef monitoring and management tools, at a time when the world's coral reefs are declining due to local and global stressors.","[Zweifler, Adi; Akkaynak, Derya; Treibitz, Tali] Univ Haifa, Leon H Charney Sch Marine Sci, Marine Technol Dept, Haifa, Israel; [Zweifler, Adi; Mass, Tali] Univ Haifa, Leon H Charney Sch Marine Sci, Marine Biol Dept, Haifa, Israel; [Akkaynak, Derya] Interuniv Inst Marine Sci, Elat, Israel",0,10.3389/fmars.2017.00273,2017

We elicit individual time preferences using an incentivized experiment, linking the resulting time preference measures to extraction data from a questionnaire, as well as data collected from a framed Common Pool Resource (CPR) experiment. Both the experiments and questionnaire were conducted with artisanal fishers in Zanzibar. Our findings suggest that the relationship between time preferences and CPR extraction is not as straightforward as predicted by classical economic theory. In contrast to earlier studies, we find that fishers' time preferences are negatively correlated to their extraction rates. Our surprising findings can partly be explained by the fact that higher time preferences are associated with lower investment in extraction capability (the disinvestment effect of time preferences), and by fishers A cognitive abilities.","[Javaid, Aneeque] Univ Osnabruck, Inst Umweltsyst Forsch, Osnabruck, Germany; [Javaid, Aneeque; Schlueter, Achim; Ghosh, Alexandra] Jacobs Univ, Bremen, Germany; [Javaid, Aneeque; Kulesz, Micaela M.; Schlueter, Achim; Ghosh, Alexandra] Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Ecol Zmt, Bremen, Germany; [Kulesz, Micaela M.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Uppsala, Sweden; [Jiddawi, Narriman S.] Dar Es Salaam Univ, Inst Marine Sci, Zanzibar, Tanzania",2,10.1371/journal.pone.0168898,2016

Yet, some species might performunique functional roles while others are redundant. Thus, the benefits of high species richness in maintaining ecosystem functioning are uncertain if functions have little redundancy, potentially leading to high vulnerability of functions. We studied the natural propensity of assemblages to be functionally buffered against loss prior to fishing activities, using functional trait combinations, in coral reef fish assemblages across unfished wilderness areas of the Indo-Pacific: Chagos Archipelago, New Caledonia and French Polynesia. Fish functional diversity in these wilderness areas is highly vulnerable to fishing, explained by species-and abundance-based redundancy packed into a small combination of traits, leaving most other trait combinations (60%) sensitive to fishing, with no redundancy. Functional vulnerability peaks for mobile and sedentary top predators, and large species in general. Functional vulnerability decreases for certain functional entities in New Caledonia, where overall functional redundancy was higher. Uncovering these baseline patterns of functional vulnerability can offer early warning signals of the damaging effects from fishing, and may serve as baselines to guide precautionary and even proactive conservation actions.","[D'agata, Stephanie; Villeger, Sebastien; Mouillot, David] Univ Montpellier, MARBEC, UMR IRD CNRS UM IFREMER 9190, F-34095 Montpellier, France; [D'agata, Stephanie; Vigliola, Laurent; Gerard Mou-Tham] Inst Rech Dev, ENTROPIE, UMR IRD UR CNRS 9220, Lab Excellence LABEX CORAIL, BP A5, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia; [D'agata, Stephanie] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Marine Programs, 2300 Southern Blvd, Bronx, NY 10460 USA; [Graham, Nicholas A.

Therefore, it is important to quantify sources of bias in OC surveys, such as the possibility that avoidance of OC divers by fishes can lead to undercounting in areas where targeted species have come to associate divers with a risk of being speared. One potential way to reduce diver avoidance is to utilize closed circuit rebreathers (CCRs), which do not produce the noise and bubbles that are a major source of disturbance associated with OC diving. For this study, we conducted 66 paired OC and CCR fish surveys in the Main Hawaiian Islands at locations with relatively high, moderate, and light fishing pressure. We found no significant differences in biomass estimates between OC and CCR surveys when data were pooled across all sites, however there were differences at the most heavily fished location, Oahu. There, biomass estimates from OC divers were significantly lower for several targeted fish groups, including surgeonfishes, targeted wrasses, and snappers, as well as for all targeted fishes combined, with mean OC biomass between 32 and 68% of mean CCR biomass. There were no clear differences between OC and CCR biomass estimates for these groups at sites with moderate or low fishing pressure, or at any location for other targeted fish groups, including groupers, parrotfishes, and goatfishes. Bias associated with avoidance of OC divers at heavily fished locations could be substantially reduced, or at least calibrated for, by utilization of CCR. In addition to being affected by fishing pressure, the extent to which avoidance of OC divers is problematic for visual surveys varies greatly among taxa, and is likely to be highly influenced by the survey methodology and dimensions used.","[Gray, Andrew E.; Williams, Ivor D.; Lino, Kevin C.; Rooney, John J.; Asher, Jacob M.] NOAA, Coral Reef Ecosyst Program, Ecosyst Sci Div, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Gray, Andrew E.; Lino, Kevin C.; Rooney, John J.; Asher, Jacob M.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Joint Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Stamoulis, Kostantinos A.; Asher, Jacob M.] Curtin Univ, Dept Environm & Agr, Perth, WA, Australia; [Stamoulis, Kostantinos A.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Biol, Fisheries Ecol Res Lab, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Boland, Raymond C.] NOAA, Ecosyst Sci Div, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Honolulu, HI USA; [Hauk, Brian B.; Leonard, Jason C.; Kosaki, Randall K.] NOAA, Papahanaumokuakea Marine Natl Monument, Honolulu, HI USA; [Lopes, Keolohilani H., Jr.] Univ Hawaii, Trop Conservat Biol & Environm Sci, Hilo, HI 96720 USA",4,10.1371/journal.pone.0167724,2016

Low rates of subsistence consumption confirmed a primary role of sea cucumbers in income security. Prices of sea cucumbers sold by fishers varied greatly among countries, depending on the species. Gender variation in landing prices could be due to women catching smaller sea cucumbers or because some traders take advantage of them. Dissatisfaction with fishery income was common (44% of fishers), especially for i-Kiribati fishers, male fishers, and fishers experiencing difficulty selling their catch, but was uncorrelated with sale prices. Income dissatisfaction worsened with age. The number of livelihood activities averaged 2.2-2.5 across countries, and varied significantly among locations. Sea cucumbers were often a primary source of income to fishers, especially in Tonga. Other common livelihood activities were fishing other marine resources, copra production in Kiribati, agriculture in Fiji, and salaried jobs in New Caledonia. Fishing other coastal and coral reef resources was the most common fall-back livelihood option if fishers were forced to exit the fishery. Our data highlight large disparities in subsistence consumption, gender-related price equity, and livelihood diversity among parallel artisanal fisheries. Improvement of supply chains in dispersed small-scale fisheries appears as a critical need for enhancing income and wellbeing of fishers. Strong evidence for co-dependence among small-scale fisheries, through fall-back livelihood preferences of fishers, suggests that resource managers must mitigate concomitant effects on other fisheries when considering fishery closures. That is likely to depend on livelihood diversification programs to take pressure off co-dependent fisheries.","[Purcell, Steven W.] Southern Cross Univ, Natl Marine Sci Ctr, Coffs Harbour, NSW, Australia; [Ngaluafe, Poasi] Minist Agr & Food Forests & Fisheries, Nukualofa, Tonga; [Foale, Simon J.] James Cook Univ, Coll Arts Soc & Educ, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Cocks, Nicole; Cullis, Brian R.] Univ Wollongong, Fac Engn & Informat Sci, Natl Inst Appl Stat Res Australia, Sch Math & Appl Stat, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Lalavanua, Watisoni] Partners Community Dev Fiji, Suva, Fiji; [Lalavanua, Watisoni] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Suva, Fiji",4,10.1371/journal.pone.0165633,2016

One natural process that could facilitate the recovery of reef ecosystems is coral recruitment, which can be influenced by the benthic organisms in a local habitat. We experimentally tested both a global stressor (increased seawater temperature) and a local stressor (exposure to microcolin A, a natural product from a common marine benthic cyanobacterium) to determine how these stressors impacted coral larval sublethal stress, survival and settlement. Larvae of Porites astreoides had the same survival and settlement as the controls after exposure to increased temperature alone, but elevated temperature did cause oxidative stress. When exposed to natural concentrations of microcolin A, larval survival and settlement were significantly reduced. When larvae were exposed to these two stressors sequentially there was no interactive effect; but when exposed to both stressors simultaneously, there was a synergistic reduction in larval survival and an increase in oxidative stress more than in either stressor treatment alone. Increased seawater temperatures made larvae more susceptible to a concurrent local stressor disrupting a key process of coral reef recovery and resilience. These results highlight the importance of understanding how interactive stressors of varying spatial scales can impact coral demographics.","[Ritson-Williams, Raphael; Paul, Valerie J.] Smithsonian Marine Stn Ft Pierce, Ft Pierce, FL 34949 USA; [Ritson-Williams, Raphael] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Biol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Ross, Cliff] Univ North Florida, Dept Biol, 1 UNF Dr, Jacksonville, FL USA",7,10.1371/journal.pone.0166581,2016

In this study we aimed to infer spatial and temporal variation in population connectivity and dispersal of a marine fish species, using genetic tools and comparing these with oceanographic transport. We focused on an intertidal rocky reef fish species, the shore clingfish Lepadogaster lepadogaster, along the southwest Iberian Peninsula, in 2011 and 2012. We predicted high levels of self-recruitment and distinct populations, due to short pelagic larval duration and because all its developmental stages have previously been found near adult habitats. Genetic analyses based on microsatellites countered our prediction and a biophysical dispersal model showed that oceanographic transport was a good explanation for the patterns observed. Adult sub-populations separated by up to 300 km of coastline displayed no genetic differentiation, revealing a single connected population with larvae potentially dispersing long distances over hundreds of km. Despite this, parentage analysis performed on recruits from one focal site within the Marine Park of Arrabida (Portugal), revealed self-recruitment levels of 2.5% and 7.7% in 2011 and 2012, respectively, suggesting that both long-and short-distance dispersal play an important role in the replenishment of these populations. Population differentiation and patterns of dispersal, which were highly variable between years, could be linked to the variability inherent in local oceanographic processes. Overall, our measures of connectivity based on genetic and oceanographic data highlight the relevance of long-distance dispersal in determining the degree of connectivity, even in species with short pelagic larval durations.","[Klein, Maria; Teixeira, Sara; Assis, Jorge; Serrao, Ester A.; Borges, Rita] Univ Algarve, CCMAR Ctr Marine Sci, Campus Gambelas, P-8005 ~139 Faro, Portugal; [Klein, Maria; Goncalves, Emanuel J.; Borges, Rita] ISPA Inst Univ, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, R Jardim do Tabaco 34, P-1149 ~041 Lisbon, Portugal",4,10.1371/journal.pone.0165881,2016

It is especially relevant for developing countries where such information is usually lacking and fisheries management is greatly needed. To address this gap, this study maps the structure of value chains of fish and marine invertebrates caught by small-scale fisheries from Sao Vicente, Cape Verde (West Africa), and examines the main socio-economic drivers behind the seafood trade on the island. Specifically, it shows how drivers, such as tourism and the local market, shape the preferences for certain species and how they affect the distribution of income among actors involved in the seafood trade. To collect this information, interviews were done with fishers, small-scale traders, market vendors, and restaurant owners, in all fishing communities of the island of Sao Vicente, in 2015. Tourism and the local market drive the exploitation of a wide variety of marine species, from small demersal low trophic level fish and marine invertebrates, to large pelagic high trophic level fish species. Moreover, the local seafood market, and especially tourism dynamics, contribute to the unequal distribution of income among actor groups, benefiting mostly restaurant owners due to their direct access to tourist consumers. Such findings have implications for local fishery resources management, food security, and fishing communities' livelihoods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In response to conflict and non-compliance, the governance of marine resources is increasingly embracing community-based approaches, assuming that by putting communities at the forefront of planning and management, participation will increase, causing positive social and ecological impacts. Given the relative newness of community-based MPAs, this study explores how resource users perceive their impacts on ecosystem services (ES) and human well-being (HWB). This study, explores two community-based MPAs called tengefus in Kenya using mixed qualitative methods, including a participatory photography method called photovoice. Participation in and donor support for tengefus influences how resource users perceived tengefus and their impacts on ES and HWB. Individuals who were engaged in the tengefu from the inception or held official positions perceived more positive impacts on ES and HWB compared to those not as involved. Tengefus were often viewed by communities as attractors for external support and funding, positively influencing attitudes and feelings towards conservation. One site, the first tengefu in Kenya, had more external support and was surrounded by positive perceptions, while the other site had little external support and was surrounded by more conflict and mixed perceptions. This study exemplifies the complex social political dynamics that MPAs create and are embedded within. Community-based MPA initiatives could benefit from ensuring widespread engagement throughout the inception, implementation and management, recognizing and managing expectations around donor support, and not assuming that benefits spillover throughout the community.","[Mahajan, Shauna L.; Daw, Tim] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Mahajan, Shauna L.] World Wildlife Fund, Sci, 1250 24th St NW, Washington, DC 20037 USA",7,10.1016/j.marpol.2016.09.005,2016

The survey included responses from 170 managers, representing organizations from 50 countries and territories, and found that respondents generally agreed on the two major threats: overfishing and coastal development. However, resource allocation did not match this consensus on major threats. In particular, while overfishing receives much attention, coastal development and its attendant pollution are largely neglected and underfunded. These results call for a re-examination of how resources are allocated in coral reef conservation, with more attention given to aligning how money is spent with what are perceived to be the primary threats.","[Wear, Stephanie L.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA; [Wear, Stephanie L.] Duke Univ, Marine Lab, Nat Conservancy, 135 Duke Marine Lab Rd, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA",2,10.1016/j.marpol.2016.09.009,2016

As predicted, the number of lionfish caught increased with effort and with time since lionfish were established in an area. In contrast, participation was best predicted by national wealth (GDP per capita) and number of local dive shops. From the point of view of public engagement, derbies should therefore be held in areas where lionfish are well established, and where the pool of potential participants is large. However, if-the management goal is instead to slow the invasion, early detection is critical. The focus should then shift to areas where no or very few lionfish have been detected, and the derby approach modified to a more frequent or continuous, monitoring-like incentive scheme.","[Malpica-Cruz, Luis; Chaves, Lais C.

In this sense, understanding the primary sources of variation in spatial patterns of the biota is fundamental for designing effective conservation policies. We investigated spatial variation in fish assemblages around the windward and leeward sides of coastal islands situated across a gradient of riverine influence (13 km in length). Specifically, relationships between rocky reef fish assemblages and benthic, topographic and physical predictors were assessed. We hypothesized that river induced disturbances may overcome local habitat features in modeling spatial patterns of fish distribution. Fish assemblages varied primarily due to the strong directional gradient of riverine influence (22.6% of the estimated components of variation), followed by topographic complexity (15%), wave exposure (9.9%), and benthic cover (8%). The trophic structure of fish assemblages changed from having a high abundance of invertebrate feeders in macroalgae-dominated reefs close to river mouths to a high proportion of herbivores, planktivores and invertebrate feeder species in reefs with large boulders covered by epilithic algal matrices, as the distance from rivers increased. This gradient led to an increase of 4.5-fold in fish richness and fish trophic group diversity, 11-fold in fish biomass and 10-fold in fish abundance. Our results have implications for the conservation and monitoring of assemblages patchily distributed at small spatial scales. The major role of distance from river influences on fish assemblages rather than benthic cover and topographic complexity suggest that managing land-based activities should be a conservation priority toward reef restoration.","[Neves, Leonardo M.; Teixeira-Neves, Tatiana P.; Araujo, Francisco G.] Univ Fed Rural Rio de Janeiro, Dept Biol Anim, Lab Ecol Peixes, Campus Seropedica, Seropedica, RJ, Brazil; [Neves, Leonardo M.] Univ Fed Rural Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ciencias Meio Ambiente, Campus Tres Rios, Seropedica, RJ, Brazil; [Pereira-Filho, Guilherme H.] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Inst Mar, Lab Ecol & Conservacao Marinha, Campus Baixada Santista, Santos, SP, Brazil",5,10.1371/journal.pone.0166679,2016

While coral reef fish are often strongly associated with particular habitats, long-term studies establishing the demographic and life-history consequences of occupying different reef substrata are rare and no studies have monitored individuals in situ over their lifetime and determined the fate of their offspring. Here, we documented a quasi-turnover and local reproductive success for an entire population of orange clownfish (Amphiprion percula) from Kimbe Island, Papua New Guinea, by taking bi-annual samples of DNA over a 10-yr period (2003-2013). We compared demographic and life-history traits of individuals living on two host anemone species, Heteractis magnifica and Stichodactyla gigantea, including female size, adult continued presence (a proxy for relative longevity range), early post-settlement growth, the number of eggs per clutch and 'local' reproductive success (defined for each adult as the number of offspring returning to the natal population). Our results indicate that while the relative longevity of adults was similar on both host anemone species, females living in H. magnifica were larger than females in S. gigantea. However, despite females growing larger and producing more eggs on H. magnifica, we found that local reproductive success was significantly higher for clownfish living in S. gigantea. Life-history traits also exhibited local spatial variation, with higher local reproductive success recorded for adults living on S. gigantea on the eastern side of the island. Our findings support a 'silver-spoon' hypothesis that predicts individuals that are fortunate enough to recruit into good habitat and location will be rewarded with higher long-term reproductive success and will make a disproportionate contribution to population renewal.","[Salles, Oceane C.; Almany, Glenn R.; Planes, Serge] PSL Res Univ, EPHE, UPVD CNRS, CRIOBE USR3278, F-66360 Perpignan, France; [Salles, Oceane C.; Almany, Glenn R.; Planes, Serge] Lab Excellence CORAIL, Perpignan, France; [Saenz-Agudelo, Pablo] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Ciencias Ambient & Evolutivas, Valdivia, Chile; [Berumen, Michael L.] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Div Biol & Environm Sci & Engn, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal 23955, Saudi Arabia; [Thorrold, Simon R.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Jones, Geoffrey P.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Jones, Geoffrey P.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",2,10.1007/s00338-016-1485-1,2016

As has been reported for some asteroids, the crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) possess a seemingly advanced eye at the tip of each of its 7-23 arms. With such an array of eyes, the starfish can integrate a wide field of view of its surroundings. We hypothesise that, at close range, orientation and directional movements of the crown-of-thorns starfish are visually guided. In this study, the eyes and vision of A. planci were examined by means of light microscopy, electron microscopy, underwater goniometry, electroretinograms and behavioural experiments in the animals' natural habitat. We found that only animals with intact vision could orient to a nearby coral reef, whereas blinded animals, with olfaction intact, walked in random directions. The eye had peak sensitivity in the blue part (470 nm) of the visual spectrum and a narrow, horizontal visual field of approximately 100A degrees wide and 30A degrees high. With approximately 250 ommatidia in each adult compound eye and average interommatidial angles of 8A degrees, crown-of-thorns starfish have the highest spatial resolution of any starfish studied to date. In addition, they have the slowest vision of all animals examined thus far, with a flicker fusion frequency of only 0.6-0.7 Hz. This may be adaptive as fast vision is not required for the detection of stationary objects such as reefs. In short, the eyes seem optimised for detecting large, dark, stationary objects contrasted against an ocean blue background. Our results show that the visual sense of the crown-of-thorns starfish is much more elaborate than has been thus far appreciated and is essential for orientation and localisation of suitable habitats.","[Petie, Ronald; Hyldahl, Mia; Garm, Anders] Univ Copenhagen, Marine Biol Sect, Dept Biol, Univ Pk 4, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark; [Hall, Michael R.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, PMB 3, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia",12,10.1007/s00338-016-1478-0,2016

If juvenile fishes move, they can respond to variation in local conditions before adult home ranges are established. Alternatively, if juveniles establish fixed home ranges at settlement, their decisions may determine future population densities at small spatial scales. Field observations and translocations revealed that juvenile rabbitfishes (Siganus corallinus and S. doliatus) have small home ranges and strong homing abilities (covering 6 m in 1 h or 36 m within 24 h). Only four of 22 individuals failed to return; all were transferred up-current, suggesting that olfaction is important in homing. Small home ranges and strong homing tendencies in juvenile herbivores suggest that decisions made by recruits will impact the spatial extent of both adult fishes and the functional roles they play within ecosystems.","[Bellwood, David R.; Goatley, Christopher H.

A suture zone in the eastern Indian Ocean is home to numerous hybridising sister species, providing an ideal opportunity to determine how hybridisation affects speciation and biodiversity in coral reef fishes. At this location, hybridisation between two grouper (Epinephelidae) species: Cephalopholis urodeta (Pacific Ocean) and C. nigripinnis (Indian Ocean) was investigated to determine the genetic basis of hybridisation and to compare the ecology and life history of hybrids and their parent species. This approach aimed to provide insights into the taxonomic and evolutionary consequences of hybridisation. Despite clear phenotypic differences, multiple molecular markers revealed hybrids, and their parent species were genetically homogenous within and (thousands of kilometres) outside of the hybrid zone. Hybrids were at least as fit as their parent species (in terms of growth, reproduction, and abundance) and were observed in a broad range of intermediate phenotypes. The two species appear to be interbreeding at Christmas Island due to inherent biological and ecological compatibilities, and the lack of genetic structure may be explained by three potential scenarios: (1) hybridisation and introgression; (2) discordance between morphology and genetics; and (3) incomplete lineage sorting. Further molecular analyses are necessary to discriminate these scenarios. Regardless of which applies, C. urodeta and C. nigripinnis are unlikely to evolve in reproductive isolation as they cohabit where they are common (Christmas Island) and will source congeneric mates where they are rare (Cocos Keeling Islands).

Gut analyses showed a greater presence of algal types with higher levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in the stomachs of fish from Tanguisson, the bay with the largest observed recruits. To ensure this mechanism was one of causation and not correlation, we conducted a fully factorial experiment in which S. spinus recruits sampled from different bays were reared on all combinations of algal diets representative of the different bays. Recruits on the 'Tanguisson' diet grew faster than recruits on other diets, regardless of their origin. We propose that the greater availability of high-quality dietary resources at this location is likely conferring benefits that impact on the population-level dynamics of this species. The spatial and temporal extent of this process clearly implicates food as a limiting resource, capable of mediating fish population dynamics at multiple spatial scales and ontogenetic phases.","[Priest, Mark A.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Halford, Andrew R.] Bentley Delivery Ctr, Dept Parks & Wildlife, Locked Bag 104, Perth, WA 6983, Australia; [Clements, Kendall D.; Douglas, Emily] Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Abellana, Sheena L.] Univ Guam, Marine Lab, Mangilao, GU 96923 USA; [McIlwain, Jennifer L.] Curtin Univ, Dept Environm & Agr, Perth, WA 6107, Australia; [Douglas, Emily] Univ Waikato, Sch Sci, Hamilton, New Zealand",0,10.1007/s00338-016-1487-z,2016

We tested the null hypothesis of monogamy in a northern Caribbean population. In the Florida Keys, shrimps did not inhabit host individuals in pairs with a frequency greater than expected by chance alone. Hermaphrodites inhabited sponges solitarily and often brooded embryos. Hermaphrodites do not store sperm and need to be inseminated shortly after molting to fertilize a new batch of eggs. Thus, males and/or other hermaphrodites are likely switching among host individuals in search of sexual partners. Field experiments demonstrated low shrimp host fidelity. Host residence time was similar to 2 times shorter for males than for hermaphrodites. We inferred a polygynandrous mating system in L. pederseni from the Florida Keys, with male-role and young hermaphrodites often moving among sponges in search of older, more sedentary, female-role hermaphrodites. We expected shrimps to use water-borne chemical cues originating from conspecifics or sponges to locate sexual partners. Experiments demonstrated that shrimps were attracted to water-borne cues originating from sponges but not conspecifics. We have described the mating system of a reef-associated shrimp in a fast-pace shifting seascape increasingly dominated by sponges and vanishing stony corals. In the central and southeastern Caribbean Sea, with greater coral cover and lower sponge abundance than in the Florida Keys, the same species is monogamous. Whether or not similar shifts in the social organization of other coral reef-dwelling marine organisms are occurring due to contemporary changes in seascapes is a relevant topic that deserves further attention.","[Baeza, J.

The success of A. planci and other reef species in a changing ocean will be influenced by juvenile performance because the naturally high mortality experienced at this sensitive life history stage maybe exacerbated by ocean warming and acidification. We investigated the effects of increased temperature and acidification on growth of newly metamorphosed juvenile A. planci and their feeding rates on crustose coralline algae (CCA) during the initial herbivorous phase of their life history. The juveniles were exposed to three temperature (26, 28, 30 A degrees C) and three pH (NIST scale: 8.1, 7.8, 7.6) levels in a flow-through cross-factorial experiment. There were positive but independent effects of warming and acidification on juvenile growth and feeding. Early juveniles were highly tolerant to moderate increases in temperature (+2 A degrees C above ambient) with the highest growth at 30 A degrees C. Growth and feeding rates of A. planci on CCA were highest at pH 7.6. Thus, ocean warming and acidification may enhance the success of A. planci juveniles. In contrast to its coral prey, at this vulnerable developmental stage, A. planci appears to be highly resilient to future ocean change. Success of juveniles in a future ocean may have carry-over effects into the coral-eating life stage, increasing the threat to coral reef systems.","[Kamya, Pamela Z.; Graba-Landry, Alexia; Dworjanyn, Symon A.] Southern Cross Univ, Natl Marine Sci Ctr, Coffs Harbour, NSW, Australia; [Byrne, Maria] Univ Sydney, Schools Med & Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia",8,10.1007/s00338-016-1480-6,2016

This study explored feeding behaviour and functional responses of planktivorous damselfishes when offered captive reared larvae of crown-of-thorns starfish, Acanthaster sp., with the aim of determining whether these predators could ever play a role in moderating outbreaks of Acanthaster sp. We examined predatory behaviour of 11 species of planktivorous damselfish, testing: (1) the relationship between predator size and predation rate, both within and among fish species; (2) consumption rates on larvae of Acanthaster sp. versus larvae of a common, co-occurring coral reef asteroid Linckia laevigata; (3) maximal feeding rates upon both Acanthaster sp. and L. laevigata; and (4) functional responses of planktivorous fishes to increasing densities of Acanthaster sp. Consumption rates of crown-of-thorns larvae by damselfishes were independent of predator size; however, there was a significant negative relationship between predator size and consumption rate of L. laevigata, when pooling across all predatory species. Some damselfishes, including Acanthochromis polyacanthus and Amblyglyphidodon curacao, consumed larval Acanthaster sp. at a greater rate than for L. laevigata. Most predatory species (all except A. curacao and Pomacentrus amboinensis) exhibited a Type II functional response whereby the increasing feeding rate decelerated with increasing prey density. In addition to revealing that a wide range of planktivorous fishes can prey upon larvae of Acanthaster sp., these data suggest that planktivorous damselfishes may have the capacity to buffer against population fluctuations of Acanthaster sp. Importantly, predators with Type II functional responses often contribute to stability of prey populations, though planktivorous fishes may be swamped by an abnormally high influx of larvae, potentially contributing to the characteristic population fluctuations of Acanthaster sp.","[Cowan, Zara-Louise; Caballes, Ciemon F.; Pratchett, Morgan S.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Dworjanyn, Symon A.] Southern Cross Univ, Natl Marine Sci Ctr, Coffs Harbour, NSW 2450, Australia",13,10.1007/s00338-016-1491-3,2016

This shift can impact essential recovery processes such as larval recruitment and ecosystem resilience. Recent evidence suggests that chemical cues from certain corals attract, and from certain seaweeds suppress, recruitment of juvenile fishes, with loss of coral cover and increases in seaweed cover creating negative feedbacks that prevent reef recovery and sustain seaweed dominance. Unfortunately, the level of seaweed increase and coral decline that creates this chemically cued tipping point remains unknown, depriving managers of data-based targets to prevent damaging feedbacks. We conducted flume and field assays that suggest juvenile fishes sense and respond to cues produced by low levels of seaweed cover. However, the herbivore species we tested was more tolerant of degraded reef cues than non-herbivores, possibly providing some degree of resilience if these fishes recruit, consume macroalgae, and diminish negative cues.","[Brooker, Rohan M.; Dixson, Danielle L.] Univ Delaware, Sch Marine Sci & Policy, Lewes, DE 19958 USA; [Brooker, Rohan M.; Hay, Mark E.; Dixson, Danielle L.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol & Aquat Chem Ecol Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",0,10.1007/s00338-016-1474-4,2016

Although it has been shown that resilient ecosystems can eventually recover to pre-disturbed states, the extent to which communities in early stages of recovery could be affected by multiple anthropogenic stressors is poorly understood. Pervasive and rising anthropogenic stressors in coastal marine systems that could interactively affect the recovery of these systems following natural disturbances include high sedimentation, nutrient enrichment, and overfishing. Using a 6-month field experiment, we examined the effects of all combinations of these three stressors on key functional groups in the benthic community growing on simulated, post-disturbance reef patches within a system recovering from large-scale natural disturbances (corallivorous seastar outbreak and cyclone). Our study revealed that sedimentation, nutrient enrichment, and overfishing (simulated using exclusion cages) interactively affected coral survival and algal growth, with taxon-specific effects at multiple scales. First, our treatments affected corals and algae differently, with sedimentation being more detrimental to macroalgal growth but less detrimental to coral (Porites rus) survival in caged plots, driving significant interactions between sedimentation and caging for both taxa. We also observed distinct responses between coral species and between algal functional groups, with the most extensive responses from algal turf biomass, for which sedimentation suppressed the synergistic (positive) combined effect of nutrient enrichment and caging. Our findings suggest that different combinations of ubiquitous anthropogenic stressors, related to either sea- or land-based activities, interactively influence community recovery from disturbance and may alter species compositions in the resulting community. Our findings further suggest that anthropogenic stressors could promote further degradation of coral reefs following natural disturbances by inhibiting recovery to coral-dominated states that provide vital ecosystem services to coastal populations worldwide.","[Gil, Michael A.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL USA; [Gil, Michael A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Goldenberg, Silvan U.; Bach, Anne Ly Thai; Mills, Suzanne C.] PSL Res Univ, EPHE, UPVD CNRS, CRIOBE USR3278, Moorea, Fr Polynesia; [Goldenberg, Silvan U.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, So Seas Ecol Labs, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Mills, Suzanne C.; Claudet, Joachim] Lab Excellence CORAIL, Perpignan, France; [Claudet, Joachim] CNRS EPHE UPVD, USR 3278, CRIOBE, Natl Ctr Sci Res, Perpignan, France",8,10.1007/s00338-016-1489-x,2016

We examined the effects of sediment loads on the thalli of two increasingly abundant genera of macroalgae, Galaxaura and Padina, in a bay subject to terrestrial sediment influx in Mo'orea, French Polynesia. Field experiments examining (1) overall effects of ambient sediments and (2) interacting effects of sediments (ambient/removal) and herbivores (caged/uncaged) demonstrated that sediments had strong but opposite effects on both species' biomass accumulation. Sediment removal increased accumulation of Padina boryana Thivy 50% in the initial field experiment but had no effect in the second; rather, in a novel interaction, herbivores overcompensated for increases in tissue nutrient stores that occurred with sediments loads, likely by preferential consumption of nutrient-rich meristematic tissues. Despite negative effects of sediments on biomass, Padina maintained rapid growth across treatments in both experiments. In contrast, positive growth in Galaxaura divaricata Kjellman only occurred with ambient sediment loads. In mesocosm experiments testing interactions of added nutrients and sediments on growth, Galaxaura grew at equivalent rates with sediments (collected from thalli on the reef) as with additions of nitrate and phosphate, suggesting sediments provide a nutrient subsidy. For Padina, however, the only effect was a 50% reduction in growth with sediment. Overall, retention of thallus sediments creates a positive feedback that Galaxaura appears to require to sustain net growth, while Padina merely tolerates sediments. These results indicate that sediments can modify nutrient and herbivore control of algae in ways that differ among species, with the potential for strong and unexpected effects on the abundance and composition of tropical reef macroalgae.","[Clausing, Rachel J.; Bittick, Sarah Joy; Fong, Peggy] Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Young Dr S, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Fong, Caitlin R.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",4,10.1007/s00338-016-1477-1,2016

However, in addition to the gradual decrease in seawater pH and Omega (a) resulting from anthropogenic activities, seawater carbonate chemistry in these coastal ecosystems is also strongly influenced by the benthic metabolism which can either exacerbate or alleviate OA through net community calcification (NCC = calcification - CaCO3 dissolution) and net community organic carbon production (NCP = primary production - respiration). Therefore, to project OA on coral reefs, it is necessary to understand how different benthic communities modify the reef seawater carbonate chemistry. In this study, we used flow-through mesocosms to investigate the modification of seawater carbonate chemistry by benthic metabolism of five distinct reef communities [carbonate sand, crustose coralline algae (CCA), corals, fleshy algae, and a mixed community] under ambient and acidified conditions during summer and winter. The results showed that different communities had distinct influences on carbonate chemistry related to the relative importance of NCC and NCP. Sand, CCA, and corals exerted relatively small influences on seawater pH and Omega (a) over diel cycles due to closely balanced NCC and NCP rates, whereas fleshy algae and mixed communities strongly elevated daytime pH and Omega (a) due to high NCP rates. Interestingly, the influence on seawater pH at night was relatively small and quite similar across communities. NCC and NCP rates were not significantly affected by short-term acidification, but larger diel variability in pH was observed due to decreased seawater buffering capacity. Except for corals, increased net dissolution was observed at night for all communities under OA, partially buffering against nighttime acidification. Thus, algal-dominated areas of coral reefs and increased net CaCO3 dissolution may partially counteract reductions in seawater pH associated with anthropogenic OA at the local scale.","[Page, Heather N.; Andersson, Andreas J.; Lebrato, Mario; Yeakel, Kiley; Davidson, Charlie; D'Angelo, Sydney] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Jokiel, Paul L.; Rodgers, Ku'ulei S.; Bahr, Keisha D.] Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, 46-007 Lilipuna Rd, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA",11,10.1007/s00338-016-1490-4,2016

Ocean acidification (OA) due to elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations has been suggested to stimulate macroalgal growth and abundance on reefs. However, little is known about the physiological mechanisms by which reef macroalgae use CO2 from the bulk seawater for photosynthesis [i.e., (1) direct uptake of bicarbonate (HCO3 (-)) and/or CO2 by means of carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCM) and (2) the diffusive uptake of CO2], which species could benefit from increased CO2 or which habitats may be more susceptible to acidification-induced algal proliferations. Here, we provide the first quantitative examination of CO2-use strategies in coral reef macroalgae and provide information on how the proportion of species and the proportional abundance of species utilising each of the carbon acquisition strategies varies across a gradient of terrestrial influence (from inshore to offshore reefs) in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Four macroalgal groups were identified based on their carbon uptake strategies: (1) CCM-only (HCO3 (-) only users); (2) CCM-HCO3 (-)/CO2 (active uptake HCO3 (-) and/or CO2 use); (3) Non-CCM species (those relying on diffusive CO2 uptake); and (4) Calcifiers. delta C-13 values of macroalgae, confirmed by pH drift assays, show that diffusive CO2 use is more prevalent in deeper waters, possibly due to low light availability that limits activity of CCMs. Inshore shallow reefs had a higher proportion of CCM-only species, while reefs further away from terrestrial influence and exposed to better water quality had a higher number of non-CCM species than inshore and mid-shelf reefs. As non-CCM macroalgae are more responsive to increased seawater CO2 and OA, reef slopes of the outer reefs are probably the habitats most vulnerable to the impacts of OA. Our results suggest a potentially important role of carbon physiology in structuring macroalgal communities in the GBR.","[Diaz-Pulido, Guillermo; Gartrell, Patrick; Tran, Dien V.] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst Coast & Estuaries, Griffith Sch Environm, Nathan Campus,170 Kessels Rd, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; [Diaz-Pulido, Guillermo] Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Cornwall, Christopher] Univ Otago, Dept Bot, 464 Great King St, Dunedin 9016, New Zealand; [Cornwall, Christopher] Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Environm, 35 Stilring Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Cornwall, Christopher] Univ Western Australia, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, 35 Stilring Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Cornwall, Christopher; Hurd, Catriona] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarct Studies, 20 Castray Esplanade, Hobart, Tas 7004, Australia",8,10.1007/s00338-016-1481-5,2016

Here we assess the demographic replenishment and resilience potential of the local reefs, i.e., the potential for new sexually derived corals to recruit and exceed the community's mortality rate. We present a detailed analysis of coral community demography, obtained by means of high-resolution photographic monitoring of permanently marked plots. Coral spats as small as 1 mm were documented and the detailed dynamics of coral recruitment and mortality were recorded, in addition to other common ecological measurements. The cumulative quantity of recruited individuals was twofold to fivefold higher than total mortality. The most significant predictor variable for coral recruitment among all ecological parameters measured was the available substrate for settlement, and the survival of recruited corals was correlated with reef structural complexity. Two consecutive annual reproductive seasons (June-September of each year) with high recruitment rates were monitored. Combined with the high survival of recruits and the increase in coral live cover and abundance, the findings from this study indicate an encouraging potential for recovery of these reefs.","[Shlesinger, Tom; Loya, Yossi] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",9,10.1007/s00338-016-1468-2,2016

This study explores in situ variation in calcification rates of Acropora downingi in the northeastern Persian Gulf relative to seasonal changes in temperature, irradiance and aragonite saturation state (Omega (arag)). Calcification rates of A. downingi were highest in the spring and lowest in the winter, and intra-annual variation in calcification rate was significantly related to temperature (r (2) = 0.30) and irradiance (r (2) = 0.36), but not Omega (arag) (r (2) = 0.02). Seasonal differences in temperature are obviously confounded by differences in other environmental conditions and vice versa. Therefore, we used published relationships from experimental studies to establish which environmental parameter(s) (temperature, irradiance, and/or Omega (arag)) placed greatest constraints on calcification rate (relative to the maximum spring rate) in each season. Variation in calcification rates was largely attributable to seasonal changes in irradiance and temperature (possibly similar to 57.4 and 39.7% respectively). Therefore, we predict that ocean warming may lead to increased rates of calcification during winter, but decelerate calcification during spring, fall and especially summer, resulting in net deceleration of calcification for A. downingi in the Persian Gulf.","[Samiei, Jahangir Vajed; Saleh, Abolfazl; Shirvani, Arash; Fumani, Neda Sheijooni; Hashtroudi, Mehri] Iranian Natl Inst Oceanog & Atmospher Sci, Etemadzadeh St,Fatemi Ave,POB 14155-4181, Tehran, Iran; [Pratchett, Morgan Stuart] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",6,10.1007/s00338-016-1464-6,2016

With significant global coral reef cover already lost due to bleaching-induced mortality, efforts are underway to identify thermally tolerant coral communities that might survive projected warming. Massive, long-lived corals accrete skeletal bands of anomalously high density in response to episodes of thermal stress. These ""stress bands"" are potentially valuable proxies for thermal tolerance, but to date their application to questions of community bleaching history has been limited. Ecological surveys recorded bleaching of coral communities across the Palau archipelago during the 1998 and 2010 warm events. Between 2011 and 2015, we extracted skeletal cores from living Porites colonies at 10 sites spanning barrier reef and lagoon environments and quantified the proportion of stress bands present in each population during bleaching years. Across Palau, the prevalence of stress bands tracked the severity of thermal stress, with more stress bands occurring in 1998 (degree heating weeks = 13.57 A degrees C-week) than during the less severe 2010 event (degree heating weeks = 4.86 A degrees C-week). Stress band prevalence also varied by reef type, as more corals on the exposed barrier reef formed stress bands than did corals from sheltered lagoon environments. Comparison of Porites stress band prevalence with bleaching survey data revealed a strong correlation between percent community bleaching and the proportion of colonies with stress bands in each year. Conversely, annual calcification rates did not decline consistently during bleaching years nor did annually resolved calcification histories always track interannual variability in temperature. Our data suggest that stress bands in massive corals contain valuable information about spatial and temporal trends in coral reef bleaching and can aid in conservation efforts to identify temperature-tolerant coral reef communities.","[Barkley, Hannah C.] MIT, Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Joint Program Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Cohen, Anne L.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",4,10.1007/s00338-016-1483-3,2016

In this study, we combined published experimental data to determine the relative importance of sea water properties for coral fertilisation success and larval survivorship. Of the water properties manipulated in experiments, fertilisation success was most sensitive to suspended sediment, copper, salinity, phosphate and ammonium. Larval survivorship was sensitive to copper, lead and salinity. A combined model was developed that estimated the joint probability of both fertilisation and larval survivorship in sea water with different chemical and physical properties. We demonstrated the combined model using water samples from Sydney and Lizard Island in Australia to estimate the likelihood of larvae surviving through both stages of development to settlement competency.

Here, we investigate the relationships between diet, habitat and social behaviour in damselfishes (Pomacentridae) collected in 2014 at Moorea Island (17 degrees 30'S, 149 degrees 50'W), French Polynesia. Isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen, in association with stomach contents, delineate three trophic groups: pelagic feeders consuming zooplankton, benthic feeders mainly grazing on algae and an intermediate group feeding on prey from the whole bentho-pelagic compartment. Sulphur isotope ratios indicate segregation between species of the outer reef mostly depending on oceanic input of zooplankton and the lagoonal species relying on locally produced resources or even on terrestrial supply. We demonstrate a tight association between dietary specializations, habitat characteristics and social behaviours, and these correlations are further confirmed by integrating the phylogeny of Pomacentridae. We also provide evidence of phylogenetic conservatism for the stomach content and the habitat-behaviour characters. However, the isotopic trait is evolutionarily more labile probably because it thoroughly depicts the ecological niche of species. To summarize, pelagic feeders (mainly from the Chrominae) usually form shoals in areas close to the open ocean at a maximum depth of 20 m.

However, it is uncertain to what extent this effect also occurs in temperate species. The effects that elevated pCO(2) (similar to 2000 mu atm) levels, which are expected to occur in coastal upwelling regions in the future, have on shoaling behaviour and lateralization (turning preference) of fish, were tested in temperate sand smelt Atherina presbyter larvae. The hypothesis that behavioural changes are caused by interference of high CO2 with GABA-A receptor function was tested by treating larvae with a receptor antagonist (gabazine). Routine swimming speed did not differ between control and high pCO(2), but exposure to high pCO(2) for 7 days affected group cohesion, which presented a more random distribution when compared to control fish. However, this random distribution was reversed after 21 days of exposure to high CO2 conditions. Lateralization at the individual level decreased in fish exposed to high pCO(2) for 7 and 21 days, but gabazine reversed this decline. This adds to the growing body of evidence that the effects of a more acidified environment on fish larvae behaviour are likely due to altered function of GABA-A receptors. Overall, our results suggest that future pCO(2) levels likely to occur in temperate coastal ecosystems could have an adverse effect on temperate larval fish behaviour.","[Lopes, A. F.; Goncalves, E.

Both species were detected throughout the 12-month duration of transmitters (mean detection period: similar to 270 days) and often made deep movements to similar to 40 m possibly related to reproductive behaviour (spawning). Differences in space use were apparent between species, with P. laevis consistently using greater area around reefs throughout the year. Overall, depth use patterns were similar between species; however, when daily detections were grouped in 2-h periods, P. laevis remained shallower and had greater variation in depth use compared to P. leopardus.

Less frequently studied are interactions between butterflyfishes and soft corals, even though the latter represent significant habitat and energetic resources on Indo-Pacific coral reefs. Changes to the benthic community structure of three disjunct back-reef communities on the leeward side of Guam were monitored over two decades, from 1994 to 2014. These communities include a reef that has remained stable and relatively pristine through time, a reef that is significantly impaired but has remained stable over time, and a reef that has experienced significant changes in response to anthropogenic and natural disturbances during this period. Density and behavior of six species of butterflyfishes, including an obligate hard corallivore, two soft corallivores, and three generalists of varied dietary breadth, were recorded at each of the sites in 1994, 2004, and 2014. The populations of butterflyfishes varied through time and space, and there were significant changes in foraging behaviors, largely associated with changes in the soft coral community. Moreover, the soft corallivores exhibited differential prey preferences, some of which were directly attributable to their ability to handle soft coral chemical defenses, while others appeared to be more opportunistic. Given this tight coupling between butterflyfishes and soft corals, this resource needs to be a focus of future studies.","[Slattery, Marc; Gochfeld, Deborah J.] Univ Mississippi, Dept BioMol Sci, Oxford, MS 38677 USA; [Slattery, Marc; Gochfeld, Deborah J.] Univ Mississippi, Natl Ctr Nat Prod Res, Oxford, MS 38677 USA",0,10.1007/s00227-016-3025-5,2016

We assess the relative importance of human and biophysical (habitat and oceanographic) drivers on the biomass of five herbivorous functional groups among 33 islands in the central and western Pacific Ocean. Human impacts were clear for some, but not all, herbivore groups. Biomass of browsers, large excavators, and of all herbivores combined declined rapidly with increasing human population density, whereas grazers, scrapers, and detritivores displayed no relationship. Sea-surface temperature had significant but opposing effects on the biomass of detritivores (positive) and browsers (negative). Similarly, the biomass of scrapers, grazers, and detritivores correlated with habitat structural complexity; however, relationships were group specific. Finally, the biomass of browsers and large excavators was related to island geomorphology, both peaking on low-lying islands and atolls.

We used a historical baseline from Kosrae, a typical small island in Micronesia, to examine changes in fish and coral assemblages since 1986. We found that natural gradients in the spatial distribution of fish and coral assemblages have become amplified, as island geography is now a stronger determinant of species abundance patterns, and habitat forming Acropora corals and large-bodied fishes that were once common on the leeward side of the island have become scarce. A proxy for fishing access best predicted the relative change in fish assemblage condition over time, and in turn, declining fish condition was the only factor correlated with declining coral condition, suggesting overfishing may have reduced ecosystem resilience. Additionally, a proxy for watershed pollution predicted modern coral assemblage condition, suggesting pollution is also reducing resilience in densely populated areas. Altogether, it appears that unsustainable fishing reduced ecosystem resilience, as fish composition has shifted to smaller species in lower trophic levels, driven by losses of large predators and herbivores. While prior literature and anecdotal reports indicate that major disturbance events have been rare in Kosrae, small localized disturbances coupled with reduced resilience may have slowly degraded reef condition through time. Improving coral-reef resilience in the face of climate change will therefore require improved understanding and management of growing artisanal fishing pressure and watershed pollution.","[McLean, Matthew; Cuetos-Bueno, Javier; Houk, Peter] Univ Guam, Marine Lab, Mangilao, GU 96923 USA; [Nedlic, Osamu; Luckymiss, Marston] Kosrae Conservat & Safety Off, Tofol, Kosrae State, Micronesia",4,10.1371/journal.pone.0166319,2016

Coral reefs are affected by an emerging fungal disease named aspergillosis, caused by Aspergillus sydowii. This disease and its pathogen have been reported along the Caribbean and Pacific coasts of Colombia. Despite this, an important number of coral reefs worldwide have not been investigated for the presence of this pathogen. In this work, we carried out the surveillance of the main coral reef of the Ecuadorian Pacific with a focus on the two most abundant and cosmopolitan species of this ecosystem, Leptogorgia sp. and Leptogorgia obscura. We collected 59 isolates and obtained the corresponding sequences of the Internal Transcribed Spacers (ITS) of the ribosomal DNA. These were phylogenetically analyzed using MrBayes, which indicated the presence of two isolates of the coral reef pathogen A. sydowii, as well as 16 additional species that are potentially pathogenic to corals. Although the analyzed gorgonian specimens appeared healthy, the presence of these pathogens, especially of A. sydowii, alert us to the potential risk to the health and future survival of the Pacific Ecuadorian coral ecosystem under the current scenario of increasing threats and stressors to coral reefs, such as habitat alterations by humans and global climate change.","[Soler-Hurtado, M.

With the exception of requiem sharks, all the groups showing a higher level of diversity in reefs than in non-reef habitats have diets based predominantly on plankton, algae or benthic invertebrates. Here we explore the pattern of diversification of carangoid fishes, a clade that includes numerous piscivorous species (e.g. trevallies, jacks and dolphinfishes), using time-calibrated phylogenies as well as ecological and morphological data from both extant and fossil species. The study of carangoid morphospace suggests that reef environments played a role in their early radiation during the Eocene. However, contrary to the hypothesis of a reef-association-promoting effect, we show that habitat shifts to non-reef environments have increased the rates of morphological diversification (i.e. size and body shape) in extant carangoids. Piscivory did not have a major impact on the tempo of diversification of this group. Through the ecological radiation of carangoid fishes, we demonstrate that non-reef environments may sustain and promote processes of diversification of different marine fish groups, at least those including a large proportion of piscivorous species.","[Frederich, Bruno] Univ Liege, AFFISH Res Ctr, Lab Morphol Fonct & Evolut, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Frederich, Bruno] Univ Liege, MARE Ctr, Lab Oceanol, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Marrama, Giuseppe; Carnevale, Giorgio] Univ Turin, Dipartimento Sci Terra, I-10125 Turin, Italy; [Santini, Francesco] Assoc Italiana Studio Biodiversita, I-56100 Pisa, Italy",6,10.1098/rspb.2016.1556,2016

These global stressors: cannot be avoided by local management, compound local stressors, and hasten the loss of ecosystem services. Impacts to people will be most grave where a) human dependence on coral reef ecosystems is high, b) sea surface temperature reaches critical levels soonest, and c) ocean acidification levels are most severe. Where these elements align, swift action will be needed to protect people's lives and livelihoods, but such action must be informed by data and science. An Indicator Approach Designing policies to offset potential harm to coral reef ecosystems and people requires a better understanding of where CO2-related global environmental stresses could cause the most severe impacts. Mapping indicators has been proposed as a way of combining natural and social science data to identify policy actions even when the needed science is relatively nascent. To identify where people are at risk and where more science is needed, we map indicators of biological, physical and social science factors to understand how human dependence on coral reef ecosystems will be affected by globally-driven threats to corals expected in a high-CO2 world. Western Mexico, Micronesia, Indonesia and parts of Australia have high human dependence and will likely face severe combined threats. As a region, Southeast Asia is particularly at risk. Many of the countries most dependent upon coral reef ecosystems are places for which we have the least robust data on ocean acidification.

To address this gap, we simultaneously monitored three reefs along a cross-shelf gradient for an entire year over four seasons, collecting data on currents, temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), chlorophyll-a, turbidity, inorganic nutrients, sedimentation, bacterial communities of reef water, and bacterial and algal composition of epilithic biofilms. Summer temperature (29-33 degrees C) and salinity (39 PSU) exceeded average global maxima for coral reefs, whereas DO concentration was low (2-4 mg L-1). While temperature and salinity differences were most pronounced between seasons, DO, chlorophyll-a, turbidity, and sedimentation varied most between reefs. Similarly, biotic communities were highly dynamic between reefs and seasons. Differences in bacterial biofilms were driven by four abundant families: Rhodobacteraceae, Flavobacteriaceae, Flammeovirgaceae, and Pseudanabaenaceae. In algal biofilms, green crusts, brown crusts, and crustose coralline algae were most abundant and accounted for most of the variability of the communities. Higher bacterial diversity of biofilms coincided with increased algal cover during spring and summer. By employing multivariate matching, we identified temperature, salinity, DO, and chlorophyll-a as the main contributing physico-chemical drivers of biotic community structures. These parameters are forecast to change most with the progression of ocean warming and increased nutrient input, which suggests an effect on the recruitment of Red Sea benthic communities as a result of climate change and anthropogenic influence.

Each year, the country's predominantly small-scale fisheries generate an estimated US$22 million in revenue - 1.8% of GDP - and employ 3000 people. However, the nation's fishing communities are facing an unprecedented challenge. Existing threats posed by declining fish stocks have been exacerbated by the introduction of the invasive alien red lionfish Pterois volitans in 2008. This Indo-Pacific predator has the potential to cause significant losses to the recruitment of native fish, in turn disrupting coral reef community dynamics in the Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Howefver, targeted lionfish fishing may offer a cost effective means to control the invasion, while also creating an alternative livelihood solution and improving food security among Belize's coastal fishing communities. This study summarises the recent history of the lionfish invasion in Belize, describes the multi-sector approach being used to address the invasion, and presents preliminary research summarising the characteristics of invasive alien lionfish in Belize. Data from Belize's nascent 'lionfishery' are also presented, demonstrating that demand for lionfish is outweighing supply-largely as a result of awareness-raising initiatives- and highlighting the strong potential for replication of this approach elsewhere in the Caribbean. The study concludes by discussing the barriers and potential solutions to this market-based approach to invasive species management. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The strong genetic differentiation (Phi(CT) = 0.199, P < 0.001) suggests that Indo-West Pacific populations of L. laevigata can be grouped into four biogeographic regions: (1) WIO (2) Eastern Indian Ocean (3) IMPA and (4) Western Pacific.

To better understand the sponge thermal stress response, we investigated gene expression dynamics in the shallow water sponge, Haliclona tubifera (order Haplosclerida, class Demospongiae), subjected to elevated temperature. Using high-throughput transcriptome sequencing, we show that these conditions result in the activation of various processes that interact to maintain cellular homeostasis. Short-term thermal stress resulted in the induction of heat shock proteins, antioxidants, and genes involved in signal transduction and innate immunity pathways. Prolonged exposure to thermal stress affected the expression of genes involved in cellular damage repair, apoptosis, signaling and transcription. Interestingly, exposure to sublethal temperatures may improve the ability of the sponge to mitigate cellular damage under more extreme stress conditions.

Behavioural lateralization often manifests in a turning bias in fishes, with some individuals showing a left bias and others a right bias. Such biases could be the source of considerable conflict in fish schools given that there may be considerable social pressure to conform to the group to maintain effective group evasion. Here, we show that predation pressure is a major determinant of the degree of lateralization, both in a relative and absolute sense, in yellow-and-blueback fusiliers (Caesio teres), a schooling fish common on coral reefs. Wild-caught fish showed a bias for right turning. When predation pressure was experimentally elevated or relaxed, the strength of lateralization changed. Higher predation pressure resulted in an increase in the strength of lateralization. Individuals that exhibited the same turning bias as the majority of individuals in their group had improved escape performance compared with individuals that were at odds with the group. Moreover, individuals that were right-biased had improved escape performance, compared with left-biased ones.

A meta-analysis of published size-specific mortality rates for coral reef fishes revealed an exponential decline in mortality rate with increasing body size, however, within this broad relationship there are three distinct phases. Phase one is characterized by naive fishes recruiting to reefs, which suffer extremely high mortality rates. In this well-studied phase, fishes must learn quickly to survive the many predation risks. After just a few days, the surviving fishes enter phase two, in which small increases in body size result in pronounced increases in lifespan (estimated 11 d mm(-1)). Remarkably, approximately 50% of reef fish individuals remain in phase two throughout their lives. Once fishes reach a size threshold of about 43 mm total length (TL) they enter phase three, where mortality rates are relatively low and the pressure to grow is presumably, significantly reduced. These phases provide a clearer understanding of the impact of body size on mortality rates in coral reef fishes and begin to reveal critical insights into the energetic and trophic dynamics of coral reefs.","[Goatley, Christopher Harry Robert] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",9,10.1098/rspb.2016.1858,2016

This situation requires tools to prioritise management interventions that result in optimum ecological outcomes under a set of constraints. Here we develop one such tool, introducing a Bayesian Belief Network to model the ecological condition of inshore coral reefs in Moreton Bay (Australia) under a range of management actions. Empirical field data was used to model a suite of possible ecological responses of coral reef assemblages to five key management actions both in the sea (e.g. expansion of reserves, mangrove & seagrass restoration, fishing restrictions) and on land (e.g. lower inputs of sediment and sewage from treatment plants). Models show that expanding marine reserves (a 'marine action') and reducing sediment inputs from the catchments (a 'land action') were the most effective investments to achieve a better status of reefs in the Bay, with both having been included in >58% of scenarios with positive outcomes, and >98% of the most effective (5th percentile) scenarios. Heightened fishing restrictions, restoring habitats, and reducing nutrient discharges from wastewater treatment plants have additional, albeit smaller effects. There was no evidence that combining individual management actions would consistently produce sizeable synergistic until after maximum investment on both marine reserves (i.e. increasing reserve extent from 31 to 62% of reefs) and sediments (i.e. rehabilitating 6350 km of waterways within catchments to reduce sediment loads by 50%) were implemented. The method presented here provides a useful tool to prioritize environmental actions in situations where multiple competing management interventions exist for coral reefs and in other systems subjected to multiple stressor from the land and the sea.","[Gilby, Ben L.; Olds, Andrew D.; Schoeman, David S.; Schlacher, Thomas A.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Sci & Engn, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia; [Connolly, Rod M.; Stevens, Tim; Henderson, Christopher J.] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm, Australian Rivers Inst Coasts & Estuaries, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia; [Maxwell, Paul S.] Univ Queensland, Sch Chem Engn, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Maxwell, Paul S.] Hlth Waterways, Level 4,200 Creek St, Spring Hill, Qld 4004, Australia; [Tibbetts, Ian R.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Rissik, David] Griffith Univ, Natl Climate Change Adaptat Res Facil, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia",7,10.1371/journal.pone.0164934,2016

Exocoetus volitans, a species of two-winged flyingfish, is a good model for understanding large-scale patterns of epipelagic fish population structure because it has a circumtropical geographic range and completes its entire life cycle in the epipelagic zone. Buoyant pelagic eggs should dictate high local dispersal capacity in this species, although a brief larval phase, small body size, and short lifespan may limit the dispersal of individuals over large spatial scales. Based on these biological features, we hypothesized that E. volitans would exhibit statistically and biologically significant population structure defined by recognized oceanographic barriers. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing cytochrome b mtDNA sequence data (1106 bps) from specimens collected in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans (n = 266). AMOVA, Bayesian, and coalescent analytical approaches were used to assess and interpret population-level genetic variability. A parsimony-based haplotype network did not reveal population subdivision among ocean basins, but AMOVA revealed limited, statistically significant population structure between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (Phi(ST) = 0.035, p<0.001). A spatially-unbiased Bayesian approach identified two circumtropical population clusters north and south of the Equator (Phi(ST) = 0.026, p<0.001), a previously unknown dispersal barrier for an epipelagic fish. Bayesian demographic modeling suggested the effective population size of this species increased by at least an order of magnitude similar to 150,000 years ago, to more than 1 billion individuals currently. Thus, high levels of genetic similarity observed in E. volitans can be explained by high rates of gene flow, a dramatic and recent population expansion, as well as extensive and consistent dispersal throughout the geographic range of the species.","[Lewallen, Eric A.; Lovejoy, Nathan R.] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Biol Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Lewallen, Eric A.; Lovejoy, Nathan R.] Mayo Clin, Dept Biochem, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Lewallen, Eric A.; van Wijnen, Andre J.] Mayo Clin, Dept Mol Biol, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Lewallen, Eric A.; van Wijnen, Andre J.] Mayo Clin, Dept Orthoped Surg, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Bohonak, Andrew J.] San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Bonin, Carolina A.] Univ St Thomas, St Paul, MN USA; [Pitmans, Robert L.] NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, La Jolla, CA USA",1,10.1371/journal.pone.0163198,2016

We tested how short-and long-term exposure to projected future temperatures affects intraspecific and interspecific competitive interactions in two species of coral reef damselfishes. In conspecific contests, juvenile Ambon damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis, exhibited no change in aggressive interactions after 4d exposure to higher temperatures. However, after 90d of exposure, fish showed a nonadaptive reduction in aggression at elevated temperatures. Conversely, 4d exposure to higher temperature increased aggression towards conspecifics in the lemon damselfish, Pomacentrus moluccensis. 90d exposure began to reduce this pattern, but overall there was little effect of temperature. Aggression in interspecific contests increased with short-term exposure, but was significantly lower after long-term exposure indicative of acclimation. Our results show how the length of exposure to elevated temperature can affect the outcome of competitive interactions. Furthermore, we illustrate that results from intraspecific contests may not accurately predict interspecific interactions, which will challenge our ability to generalise the effects of warming on competitive interactions.","[Warren, Donald T.; McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, Dept Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Warren, Donald T.; Donelson, Jennifer M.; McCormick, Mark I.; Munday, Philip L.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Donelson, Jennifer M.] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Life Sci, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia; [Ferrari, Maud C.

While melanin-based colouration is known to occur in clownfishes (Pomacentridae), little is known about the frequency at which melanistic morphs occur in natural populations. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of melanistic morphs in a coexisting population of nine clownfishes and to identify ecological covariates associated with morph distribution. In the Kavieng lagoonal system of Papua New Guinea (2 degrees 36'S, 150 degrees 46'E), melanistic morphs were found in Amphiprion chrysopterus (56 % of individuals), A. clarkii (29 %), A. percula (20 %), and A. polymnus (25 %) populations. A. leucokranos, A. melanopus, A. perideraion, A. sandaracinos, and Premnas biaculeatus populations were also surveyed, but were found to be without melanistic morphs. Unbiased recursive partitioning analyses identified a suite of interacting and conditional ecological factors encompassing social rank, host anemone species, and location effects as the primary factors predicting the distribution of melanistic morphs. Melanistic morphs were generally associated with host anemones from the genus Stichodactyla and with fish having a high social rank. The lack of a distinct melanistic morph locational 'hot spot' common to all species, despite locational coexistence, suggests that causative factors of location effects were different among species. Our results highlight the complexity of clownfish polymorphism associated with melanism, with multiple non-exclusive potential explanations identified for future investigation.","[Militz, Thane A.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Militz, Thane A.; Schoeman, David S.; Southgate, Paul C.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Australian Ctr Pacific Isl Res, Maroochydore, Australia; [Schoeman, David S.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Sci & Engn, Maroochydore, Australia; [Kinch, Jeff] Natl Fisheries Author, Natl Fisheries Coll, Kavieng, Papua N Guinea; [Militz, Thane A.; Southgate, Paul C.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Fac Sci Hlth Educ & Engn, Maroochydore, Australia",3,10.1007/s00227-016-2972-1,2016

Of particular importance to reef ecosystems are fleshy turf algal communities, which have the potential to overgrow corals; few studies have investigated the community structure and diversity of turfs to climate change. Here, we assessed the response of reef-associated turf algal communities from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia to three levels of ocean acidification. Biomass of turf communities was positively affected by increases in carbon dioxide (CO2), where turf communities grown under high CO2 had the greatest biomass. No effect of CO2 was found on mean turf organic content or genus richness. By contrast, turf community evenness and diversity (H') increased under medium and high CO2 treatments. Our results indicate that increased turf growth under high CO2 will aid the overall expansion and growth of fleshy macroalgae in coral reef ecosystems, as opportunistic algae may have an advantage over other reef-associated species. Changes in turf community diversity will help provide insight into how macroalgal communities may be structured in the future, highlighting genera primed to take advantage of the changes in ocean chemistry associated with ocean acidification.","[Ober, Gordon T.; Thornber, Carol] Univ Rhode Isl, Biol & Environm Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Diaz-Pulido, Guillermo] Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Diaz-Pulido, Guillermo] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Nathan, Qld, Australia",5,10.1007/s00227-016-2978-8,2016

Achieving the above commitment requires detailed baseline information on the spatial distribution and extent of the marine resources, such as seagrass meadows, coral reef, mangrove fotests and seaweed beds, as well as the ability to successfully interpret and understand these data. This study examined a combination of Landsat image enhancement technique and pixel-bated regional growing tools to create a map of marine and human habitats with five classes-of-interest: seagrass, land, coral and coral rubble, subsurface sand/mud, land, and human habitats for twelve islands of eastern Sabah of East Malaysia (extending from 4 degrees 42' N, 118 degrees 31' E to 4 degrees 12' N, 118 degrees 50' E), located in the south-eastern boundary of Palawan/North Borneo Ecoregion (extending from 14 degrees 31' N, 116 degrees 52' E to 0 degrees 0.04'N, 122 degrees 12' E) of the CTI implementation area. Using this method, an overall accuracy of > 75% was achieved for mapping of those class-of-interest types. The estimated seagrass areal coverage is 274 ha, of which 158 ha (58% of the total area) occurred in relatively shallow water areas. Using Google Earth data, seaweed culture sites with a total area of 7114 ha were observed around 7 of the 12 islands. The mapping approach and the results of the study will be of immense benefit to natural resource management of the study area through enabling conservation agencies to prioritize seagrass, coral, seaweed or marine conservation sites and to document local threats to those habitats.

A broad institutional approach was used to specifically assess institutional factors influencing the fishers' reasons for the current use of destructive drag-nets as well as their willingness- and economic capacity to change to less destructive gears. Different regulative, normative, cultural-cognitive and economic factors (tradition, group-belonging, social acceptance, common practice, identity of drag-net users and weak economic capacity) were identified as critical elements influencing the current use of destructive gears, as well as obstructing changes to other gears. Hence, the importance of addressing all of these factors, matching to the different contexts, rather than focusing on fast-moving regulative measures, is emphasized to increase chances of management success. More promising approaches would be resource allocations to more sustainable fishing gears, well-managed gear exchange programs, as well as alterations of slow-moving normative and cultural factors, e.g. awareness raising on the advantages of more sustainable fishing gears, their traditional and cultural values, information on the actual income they generate, as well as education and an exchange of traditional knowledge on how to use them.

However, our ability to impose new management relies on the assessment of vulnerability and adaptive capacity, and the lack of social ecological data often stifles decision making. Here we test the use of simple fisheries attributes from 33 fishing communities in an understudied, and chronically poor region of the Colombian Pacific, to generate indicators of relative fisheries adaptive capacity, as a proxy for vulnerability to planned management changes. We demonstrate the strengths of this approach using four variables (species assemblage, spatial dependence, gear dependence and compliance), and illustrate how potential threats to livelihoods can be identified early, and with limited data, allowing for management to adapt decision-making accordingly. We show that in the absence of detailed socio-economic information, relatively basic fisheries data recorded by community observers can be applied to decrease uncertainty by providing a rapid characterisation of community vulnerability to management decision-making, in a range of management intervention options.

We found that larger species and those with shallower maximum depths and smaller geographic ranges had higher extinction risk.

Aggregations are restricted to shallow reef habitats, the locations of which are often known to local fishers. Bolbometopon muricatum fisheries are therefore vulnerable to overfishing and are likely to exhibit hyperstability, the maintenance of high catch per unit effort (CPUE) while population abundance declines. In this study, we provide a clear demonstration of hyperstable dynamics in a commercial B. muricatum fishery in Isabel Province, Solomon Islands. Initially, we used participatory mapping to demarcate the Kia fishing grounds into nine zones that had experienced different historic levels of fishing pressure. We then conducted comprehensive underwater visual census (UVC) and CPUE surveys across these zones over a 21-month period in 2012-2013. The individual sites for replicate UVC surveys were selected using a generalised random tessellation stratified variable probability design, while CPUE surveys involved trained provincial fisheries officers and local spearfishers. A comparison of fishery-independent abundance data and fishery-dependent CPUE data indicate extreme hyperstability, with CPUE maintained as B. muricatum abundance declines towards zero. Hyperstability may explain the sudden collapses of many B. muricatum spear fisheries across the Pacific and highlights the limitations of using data-poor fisheries assessment methods to evaluate the status of commercially valuable coral reef fishes that form predicable aggregations.","[Hamilton, Richard J.; Peterson, Nate A.] Nature Conservancy, Asia Pacific Resource Ctr, 48 Montague Rd, South Brisbane, Qld 4101, Australia; [Hamilton, Richard J.; Almany, Glenn R.; Bode, Michael] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Almany, Glenn R.] UPVD, CRIOBE, USR 3278, CNRS,EPHE,Lab Excellence,CORAIL, 58 Ave Paul Alduy, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Stevens, Don] Stevens Environm Stat, 6200 W Starr Rd, Wasilla, AK 99654 USA; [Bode, Michael] Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, ARC Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Pita, John] Nature Conservancy, Isabel Environm Off, Buala, Isabel Province, Solomon Islands; [Choat, J.

The organisms inhabiting reef rubble are primarily bioeroders that contribute to the breakdown and dissolution of carbonate material. While the effects of ocean acidification on calcifying communities have been well studied, there are few studies investigating the response of bioeroding communities to future changes in pH and calcium carbonate saturation state. Using a flow-through pH-stat system, coral rubble pieces with a naturally occurring suite of organisms, along with bleached control rubble pieces, were subjected to three different levels of acidification over an 8-week period. Rates of net carbonate loss in bleached control rubble doubled in the acidification treatments (0.02 vs. 0.04% CaCO3 d(-1) in ambient vs. moderate and high acidification), and living rubble communities experienced significantly increased rates of net carbonate loss from ambient to high acidification conditions (0.06 vs. 0.10% CaCO3 d(-1), respectively). Although more experimentation is necessary to understand the long-term response and succession of coral rubble communities under projected conditions, these results suggest that rates of carbonate loss will increase in coral rubble as pH and calcium carbonate saturation states are reduced.

This study tested the hypothesis that the relationship between calcification and temperature is affected by OA in the coral Acropora pulchra and the calcified alga Lithophyllum kotschyanum. Pieces of each organism were incubated under five (24-30 A degrees C) or six (24-31.5 A degrees C) temperatures crossed with two pCO(2) levels (400 and 1000 mu atm), and calcification was assessed in trials conducted in the spring and summer. The response of coral calcification to temperature was a positive asymmetric parabola with a maximum at similar to 28 A degrees C under both pCO(2) levels and in both seasons; the effects of pCO(2) on calcification were largest at similar to 28 A degrees C and lowest in both cool and warm temperatures. In contrast, calcification of the alga at both levels of pCO(2) was unaffected by temperature in spring, but declined linearly with temperature in summer. This study demonstrates that the calcification response of coral reef organisms to the crossed effect of warming and OA is complex and cannot be fully assessed without using multiple temperature treatments that are ecologically relevant.","[Comeau, S.; Carpenter, R.

Species most vulnerable to these pressures tend to be ecological specialists that have low abundance and small distribution ranges (endemics). Marine endemics often exist as meta-populations distributed among few isolated locations. Determining genetic connectivity among these locations is essential to understanding the recovery potential of endemics after local extinction events. This study examined connectivity in the endemic anemonefish, Amphiprion latezonatus, a habitat specialist with low abundance at most locations. Evolutionary and contemporary migration, genetic diversity, and self-replenishment among the four main locations (Sunshine Coast, North Solitary Island, Lord Howe Island, and Norfolk Island) that comprise the entire A. latezonatus geographic range were assessed using mtDNA and microsatellite markers. Though historical gene flow inferred from mtDNA appeared high, population genetic differentiation was evident and contemporary gene flow inferred from microsatellites was limited, alongside very high (aeyen89 %) self-replenishment at all locations. Together, these data suggest prolonged recovery times following severe population decline (or extirpation) and indicate a need to protect this species at all locations, particularly Norfolk Island and Sunshine Coast where marine protected areas are lacking.","[Steinberg, Rosemary; van der Meer, Martin; Walker, Emily] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Mol Ecol & Evolut Lab, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [van der Meer, Martin] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Berumen, Michael L.] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Red Sea Res Ctr, Div Biol & Environm Sci & Engn, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia; [Hobbs, Jean-Paul A.] Curtin Univ, Dept Environm & Agr, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [van Herwerden, Lynne] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [van Herwerden, Lynne] James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",1,10.1007/s00338-016-1420-5,2016

This is complicated in marine environments by the high importance of physico-chemical water factors in determining species distributions relative to their physiological or behavioural limits. In this study, we rank the relative importance of 17 seascape, habitat and physico-chemical water factors for structuring the composition of fish communities on the inshore coral reefs of Moreton Bay, eastern Australia. Fish were surveyed at 12 reef sites along the ambient estuarine water gradient in the bay during summer and winter using a baited underwater video approach. Multivariate random forest analyses showed that reef fish community composition correlated most strongly with the local abundance of piscivorous fish and the seascape context of individual reefs (especially distance to nearest seagrass and mangroves), while water quality factors ranked much lower in importance. However, fish communities from sites nearer to rivers were more spatiotemporally variable than those from sites nearer to oceanic waters, indicating that water quality can drive variations in community structure along short-term temporal scales. In turn, piscivore abundance was greatest on reefs near large areas of seagrass, and with low sand cover, high coral cover and high water clarity. Our findings demonstrate that a reef's location within the broader seascape can be more important for fish communities than factors relating to the reef habitat itself and exposure to reduced water quality. To improve the spatial conservation of marine ecosystems, we encourage a more intimate understanding of how these factors contribute to structuring the use of habitats across seascapes by mobile species.","[Gilby, Ben L.; Stevens, Tim] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst Coasts & Estuaries, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia; [Gilby, Ben L.; Olds, Andrew D.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Sci & Engn, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia; [Tibbetts, Ian R.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Maxwell, Paul S.] Univ Queensland, Sch Engn, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Maxwell, Paul S.] Healthy Waterways, POB 13086,George St, Brisbane, Qld 4003, Australia",14,10.1007/s00338-016-1449-5,2016

Live coral cover in back reef and fringing reef habitats initially remained relatively stable, but began a gradual decline around 2010. We assessed the changes in the functional composition of the herbivorous fish community following the pulse perturbations and during the time of gradual coral decline on the back reef and fringing reef. Forty-nine species of herbivorous fishes quantified in yearly surveys between 2006 and 2014 were assigned to six functional groups: browser, detritivore, excavator, farmer, grazer/detritivore, and scraper. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analyses revealed that despite unique functional assemblages initially existing among the fringing reef, back reef, and fore reef habitats, the herbivorous fish communities in all three habitats responded in a qualitatively similar fashion to coral decline by moving toward functional communities characterized by an increased representation of excavators and scrapers. Island-wide scraper biomass increased by similar to sevenfold in the post-disturbance time period, while excavator biomass increased by nearly threefold. The biomass of detritivores and grazers/detritivores also increased over the same time period, but to a much lesser degree, while the biomass of browsers and farmers remained essentially unchanged. Macroalgae remained a relatively minor space holder (< 10 % cover) in lagoon habitats and on the fore reef through 2014, enabling recruitment of juvenile coral and initiating coral recovery on the fore reef. Results suggest that a functional community with a substantial biomass of herbivores and the capacity for the biomass of scrapers and excavators to increase rapidly in response to landscape-scale declines in coral cover may enhance resilience by preventing the widespread establishment of macroalgae.","[Han, Xueying; Schmitt, Russell J.; Holbrook, Sally J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Adam, Thomas C.; Schmitt, Russell J.; Brooks, Andrew J.; Holbrook, Sally J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Coastal Res Ctr, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",8,10.1007/s00338-016-1423-2,2016

Despite the key role of sponges as structural components, habitat providers, and nutrient recyclers in reef ecosystems, their dispersal dynamics are little understood. We used ten microsatellite markers to study the population structure and dispersal patterns of a prominent reef species, the giant barrel sponge (Xestospongia muta), the long-lived ""redwood"" of the reef, throughout Florida and the Caribbean. F-statistics, exact tests of population differentiation, and Bayesian multi-locus genotype analyses revealed high levels of overall genetic partitioning (F (ST) = 0.12, P = 0.001) and grouped 363 individuals collected from the Bahamas, Honduras, US Virgin Islands, Key Largo (Florida), and the remainder of the Florida reef tract into at minimum five genetic clusters (K = 5). Exact tests, however, revealed further differentiation, grouping sponges sampled from five locations across the Florida reef tract (similar to 250 km) into three populations, suggesting a total of six genetic populations across the eight locations sampled. Assignment tests showed dispersal over ecological timescales to be limited to relatively short distances, as the only migration detected among populations was within the Florida reef tract. Consequently, populations of this major coral reef benthic constituent appear largely self-recruiting. A combination of levels of genetic differentiation, genetic distance, and assignment tests support the important role of the Caribbean and Florida currents in shaping patterns of contemporary and historical gene flow in this widespread coral reef species.","[Richards, Vincent P.] Clemson Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Coll Agr Forestry & Life Sci, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Richards, Vincent P.; Bernard, Andrea M.; Shivji, Mahmood S.] Nova Southeastern Univ, Natl Coral Reef Inst, Halmos Coll Nat Sci & Oceanog, 8000 North Ocean Dr, Dania, FL 33004 USA; [Bernard, Andrea M.; Shivji, Mahmood S.] Nova Southeastern Univ, Guy Harvey Res Inst, Halmos Coll Nat Sci & Oceanog, 8000 North Ocean Dr, Dania, FL 33004 USA; [Feldheim, Kevin A.] Field Museum Nat Hist, Pritzker Lab Mol Systemat & Evolut, 1400 S Lake Shore Dr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA",3,10.1007/s00338-016-1435-y,2016

Excavating sponges are important bioeroders, especially in the Caribbean where sponges dominate macroborer communities. However, the contribution of bioeroding sponge communities to total bioerosion on coral reefs is not well understood; census surveys are rarely employed by monitoring agencies, and there is little data on the erosion rates of different species. Here, we investigated bioerosion by two Caribbean sponge species with different growth forms (Siphonodictyon brevitubulatum-alpha-form and Cliona tenuis-beta-form). We also described new approaches to estimating bioerosion by sponge communities. By categorising the growth form of different species, we applied newly developed bioerosion rates, along with a previously published rate for C. delitrix, to census surveys and use these to estimate bioerosion by sponge communities on Grand Cayman reefs. Results indicate distinct habitat preferences for the two most abundant sponge species, C. tenuis and C. caribbaea. Mean sponge bioerosion across eight sites was 0.1 kg CaCO3 m(-2) yr(-1). Visible cover by alpha-growth-form excavating sponges caused a disproportionately high level of bioerosion in comparison with cover by beta-growth-form species. Therefore, it is important to consider growth forms and excavation strategies when assessing bioerosion by sponge communities. Our present level of understanding of bioerosion by sponge species is limited, and more research is clearly required. However, the approaches described here can generate instant, meaningful results on sponge abundance and bioerosion and would complement many current benthic monitoring regimes. Furthermore, they create a framework for the provision of data, which is relevant to both coral reef management and to developing our understanding of how bioeroding sponge populations influence reef structure and carbonate budgets.","[Murphy, G.

Clients are known to adjust their visits to cleaners according to their ectoparasite load. Whether physiological changes due to the ectoparasitic infection, prior to engaging in cleaning interactions, might inform clients of their current need to visit cleaners remains unclear. Here, we tested whether fish blood parameters vary with ectoparasitic infection: we exposed clients (Scolopsis bilineatus) to hematophagous ectoparasite gnathiid isopods (Gnathia aureamaculosa) or a control situation for 30 min, then collected fish blood and counted gnathiids attached to fish. We found that gnathiid-exposed fish had higher blood cortisol hormone levels compared with controls. This suggests gnathiid presence in the experimental situation results in an acute stress hormone response in a fish. In contrast, while hematocrit level, a correlate of blood loss, did not significantly differ between treatments, within gnathiid-exposed fish hematocrit was negatively related to attached gnathiid number. This suggests hematocrit could provide information to a fish about gnathiid load. Thus, short-term exposure to an ectoparasite translates into possible proximate physiological mechanisms underlying client's decisions involving interactions with cleaners.","[Triki, Zegni; Bshary, Redouan; Ros, Albert F.

Species richness and average taxonomic distinctness were used to asses biological estimation; while ecological diversity was evaluated with the indices of Shannon diversity and Pielou's evenness, as well as by taxonomic diversity and distinctness. Functional diversity considered the number of functional groups, the Shannon diversity and the functional Pielou's evenness. According to the RHI, 57.15% of the zones were classified as presenting a ""poor"" health grade, while 42.85% were in ""critical"" grade. Based on the 2D-CHI, 28.5% of the zones were in ""degraded"" condition and 71.5% were ""very degraded"". Differences in fish and coral diversity among sites and zones were demonstrated using permutational ANOVAs. Differences between the two health indices (RHI and 2D-CHI) and some indices of biological, ecological and functional diversity of fish and corals were observed; however, only the RHI showed a correlation between the health grades and the species and functional group richness of fish at the scale of sites, and with the species and functional group richness and Shannon diversity of the fish assemblages at the scale of zones. None of the health indices were related to the metrics analyzed for the coral diversity. In general, our study suggests that the estimation of health indices should be complemented with classic community indices, or should at least include diversity indices of fish and corals, in order to improve the accuracy of the estimated health status of coral reefs in the western Caribbean Sea.","[Diaz-Perez, Leopoldo; Alejandro Rodriguez-Zaragoza, Fabian; Rios-Jara, Eduardo] Univ Guadalajara, Ctr Univ Ciencias Biol & Agr, Dept Ecol, Lab Ecosistemas Marinos & Acuicultura, Zapopan Jalisco, Mexico; [Ortiz, Marco] Univ Antofagasta, Fac Recursos Mar, Fac Ciencias Mar & Recursos Biol Invest Oceanol, Inst Ciencias Nat AvH,LAMSEC, Antofagasta, Chile; [Levi Cupul-Magana, Amilcar; Paola Rodriguez-Troncoso, Alma] Univ Guadalajara, Ctr Univ La Costa, Ctr Invest Costeras, Dept Ciencias Biol, Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, Mexico; [Carriquiry, Jose D.] Univ Autonoma Baja California, Inst Invest Oceanol, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico; [del Carmen Garcia-Rivas, Maria] Reserva Biosfera Banco Chinchorro CONANP, Chetmal, Quintana Roo, Mexico",5,10.1371/journal.pone.0161812,2016

They are the most abundant benthic component in the Abrolhos reef system (Brazil), representing greater than half the coverage of the entire benthic community. Their presence is associated with a reduction in three-dimensional coral reef complexity and decreases the habitats available for reef biodiversity. Despite their importance, the taxonomic and functional diversity of turfs remain unclear. We performed a metagenomics and pigments profile characterization of turfs from the Abrolhos reefs. Turf microbiome primarily encompassed Proteobacteria (mean 40.57% +/- s.d. 10.36, N = 1.548,192), Cyanobacteria (mean 35.04% +/- s.d. 15.5, N = 1.337,196), and Bacteroidetes (mean 11.12% +/- s.d. 4.25, N = 424,185). Oxygenic and anoxygenic phototrophs, chemolithotrophs, and aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic (AANP) bacteria showed a conserved functional trait of the turf microbiomes. Genes associated with oxygenic photosynthesis, AANP, sulfur cycle (S oxidation, and DMSP consumption), and nitrogen metabolism (N-2 fixation, ammonia assimilation, dissimilatory nitrate and nitrite ammonification) were found in the turf microbiomes. Principal component analyses of the most abundant taxa and functions showed that turf microbiomes differ from the other major Abrolhos benthic microbiomes (i.e., corals and rhodoliths) and seawater. Taken together, these features suggest that turfs have a homogeneous functional core across the Abrolhos Bank, which holds diverse microbial guilds when comparing with other benthic organisms.","[Walter, Juline M.; Tschoeke, Diogo A.; Meirelles, Pedro M.; de Oliveira, Louisi; Leomil, Luciana; Thompson, Cristiane C.; Thompson, Fabiano L.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Biol, Microbiol Lab, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Walter, Juline M.; Tschoeke, Diogo A.; de Oliveira, Louisi; Leomil, Luciana; Salomon, Paulo S.; Thompson, Fabiano L.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Ctr Technol CT2, SAGE COPPE, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Tenorio, Marcio; Salomon, Paulo S.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Biol, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Valle, Rogerio] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, COPPE Prod Engn Program, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",6,10.1371/journal.pone.0161168,2016

At the microscale, it is unclear how diffusive boundary layers (DBLs) and surface oxygen concentrations at the coral algal interface vary with algal competitors and competitiveness. Using field observations and microsensor measurements in a flow chamber, we show that coral (massive Porites) interfaces with thick turf algae, macro algae, and cyanobacteria, which are successful competitors against coral in the field, are characterized by a thick DBL and hypoxia at night. In contrast, coral interfaces with crustose coralline algae, conspecifics, and thin turf algae, which are poorer competitors, have a thin DBL and low hypoxia at night. Furthermore, DBL thickness and hypoxia at the interface with turf decreased with increasing flow speed, but not when thick turf was upstream. Our results support the importance of water-mediated transport mechanisms in coral algal interactions. Shifts towards algal dominance, particularly dense assemblages, may lead to thicker DBLs, higher hypoxia, and higher concentrations of harmful metabolites and pathogens along coral borders, which in turn may facilitate algal overgrowth of live corals.

Among coral reef fishes, habitat requirements vary among species and with ontogeny, but the relative importance of nursery and adult-preferred habitats on future abundances remain unclear. Moreover, adult populations may be influenced by recruitment of juveniles and assessments of habitat importance should consider relative effects of juvenile abundance. We conducted surveys across 16 sites and 200 km of reef to identify the microhabitat preferences of juveniles, sub-adults and adults of the damsel fish Pomacentrus moluccensis. Microhabitat preferences at different life-history stages were then combined with 6 years of juvenile abundance and micro habitat availability data to show that the availability of preferred juvenile microhabitat (corymbose corals) at the time of settlement was a strong predictor of future sub-adult and adult abundance. However, the influence of nursery microhabitats on future population size differed spatially and at some locations abundance of juveniles and adult microhabitat (branching corals) were better predictors of local populations.

In particular, there is an increasing need to consider the effects of climate change, especially the ability of ecosystems to resist and/or recover from climate-related disturbances, within the MPA planning process. However, there has been limited research addressing the incorporation of climate change resilience into MPA design. This study used Marxan conservation planning software with fine-scale shallow water (<20 m) bathymetry and habitat maps, models of major benthic communities for deeper water, and comprehensive human use information from Ningaloo Marine Park in Western Australia to identify climate change resilience features to integrate into the incremental refinement of the marine park. The study assessed the representation of benthic habitats within the current marine park zones, identified priority areas of high resilience for inclusion within no-take zones and examined if any iterative refinements to the current no-take zones are necessary. Of the 65 habitat classes, 16 did not meet representation targets within the current no-take zones, most of which were in deeper offshore waters. These deeper areas also demonstrated the highest resilience values and, as such, Marxan outputs suggested minor increases to the current no-take zones in the deeper offshore areas. This work demonstrates that inclusion of fine-scale climate change resilience features within the design process for MPAs is feasible, and can be applied to future marine spatial planning practices globally.","[Davies, Harriet N.; Beckley, Lynnath E.; Kobryn, Halina T.] Murdoch Univ, Sch Vet & Life Sci, Perth, WA, Australia; [Lombard, Amanda T.] Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Inst Coastal & Marine Res, Port Elizabeth, South Africa; [Radford, Ben; Heyward, Andrew] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Perth, WA, Australia",2,10.1371/journal.pone.0161094,2016

However, few studies have described benthic communities along large latitudinal gradients, and patterns of variation are not fully understood. Taiwan, lying between 21.90 degrees N and 25.30 degrees N, is located at the center of the Philippine-Japan arc and lies at the northern margin of coral reef development. A wide range of habitats is distributed along this latitudinal gradient, from extensive fringing coral reefs at the southern coast to non-reefal communities at the north. In this study, we examined the structure of benthic communities around Taiwan, by comparing its assemblages in four regions, analyzing the effects of the latitudinal gradient, and highlighting regional characteristics. A total of 25 sites, 125 transects, and 2,625 photographs were used to analyze the benthic communities. Scleractinian corals present an obvious gradient of increasing diversity from north to south, whereas macro-algae diversity is higher on the north-eastern coast. At the country scale, Taiwanese coral communities were dominated by turf algae (49%). At the regional scale, we observed an important heterogeneity that may be caused by local disturbances and habitat degradation that smooths out regional differences. In this context, our observations highlight the importance of managing local stressors responsible for reef degradation. Overall, this study provides an important baseline upon which future changes in benthic assemblages around Taiwan can be assessed.","[Ribas-Deulofeu, Lauriane; De Palmas, Stephane] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Life Sci, Taipei 11677, Taiwan; [Ribas-Deulofeu, Lauriane; De Palmas, Stephane; Chen, Chaolun Allen] Acad Sinica, Taiwan Int Grad Program, Biodivers Program, Taipei 11529, Taiwan; [Ribas-Deulofeu, Lauriane; De Palmas, Stephane; Chen, Chaolun Allen] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Taipei 11529, Taiwan; [Ribas-Deulofeu, Lauriane; Denis, Vianney; De Palmas, Stephane; Chen, Chaolun Allen] Acad Sinica, Biodivers Res Ctr, Taipei 11529, Taiwan; [Denis, Vianney; Chen, Chaolun Allen] Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Kuo, Chao-Yang] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Hsieh, Hernyi Justin] Penghu Marine Biol Res Ctr, Makong 880, Penghu, Taiwan",3,10.1371/journal.pone.0160601,2016

These two stressors can occur simultaneously, particularly in near-shore reef environments with increasing anthropogenic pressure. However, experimental studies on how elevated DIC and DOC interact are scarce and fundamental to understanding potential synergistic effects and foreseeing future changes in coral reef function. Using an open mesocosm experiment, the present study investigated the impact of elevated DIC (pH(NBS): 8.2 and 7.8; pCO(2): 377 and 1076 mu atm) and DOC (added as 833 mu mol L-1 of glucose) on calcification and photosynthesis rates of two common calcifying green algae, Halimeda incrassata and Udotea flabellum, in a shallow reef environment. Our results revealed that under elevated DIC, algal photosynthesis decreased similarly for both species, but calcification was more affected in H. incrassata, which also showed carbonate dissolution rates. Elevated DOC reduced photosynthesis and calcification rates in H. incrassata, while in U. flabellum photosynthesis was unaffected and thalus calcification was severely impaired. The combined treatment showed an antagonistic effect of elevated DIC and DOC on the photosynthesis and calcification rates of H. incrassata, and an additive effect in U. flabellum. We conclude that the dominant sand dweller H. incrassata is more negatively affected by both DIC and DOC enrichments, but that their impact could be mitigated when they occur simultaneously. In contrast, U. flabellum can be less affected in coastal eutrophic waters by elevated DIC, but its contribution to reef carbonate sediment production could be further reduced. Accordingly, while the capacity of environmental eutrophication to exacerbate the impact of OA on algal-derived carbonate sand production seems to be species-specific, significant reductions can be expected under future OA scenarios, with important consequences for beach erosion and coastal sediment dynamics.","[Meyer, Friedrich W.; Teichberg, Mirta; Wild, Christian] Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Ecol ZMT, Bremen, Germany; [Schubert, Nadine; Enriquez, Susana] UNAM, Unidad Acad Sistemas Arrecifales Puerto Morelos I, Lab Photobiol, Cancun, Mexico; [Diele, Karen] Edinburgh Napier Univ, Sch Life Sport & Social Sci, Edinburgh EH11 4BN, Midlothian, Scotland; [Wild, Christian] Univ Bremen, Fac Biol & Chem, Bibliothekstr 1, Bremen, Germany; [Diele, Karen] St Abbs Marine Stn, St Abbs TD14 5QF, Berwick, Scotland; [Schubert, Nadine] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Geociencias, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil",2,10.1371/journal.pone.0160268,2016

Surprisingly, for many countries this kind of jurisdictionally and/or ecologically assigned data had not been readily available before then. Since the release of these spatialized data, this material has had major influence on how fisheries are perceived by policy makers in various countries and by the global scientific community, as well as by a growing list of other stakeholders such as non-governmental environmental organizations and the general public. Here, the Sea Around Us updates the fisheries science, policy, conservation and management audience on the extensively modified spatial allocation method and a substantially improved new website. Also, this contribution points to and describes the much improved catch data underlying this website. These data now account for catches for all countries in the world by fisheries sectors (industrial, artisanal, subsistence, recreational), after augmenting the officially reported landings data through the inclusion of comprehensively reconstructed data of previously unreported catches and major discards, for every maritime country or territory in the world, and their Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Also presented are the extensively improved spatial allocation procedures which assign global catch data to the 180,000 half degree spatial cells used by the Sea Around Us to subdivide the global ocean. The reconstructed data for 1950-2010 for all countries in the world and the High Seas, freely accessible and downloadable through the Sea Around Us web portal, will be updated regularly. It is hoped that these revised data and the substantially improved web utility will invigorate and assist the debate about the role of fisheries in a global framework as well as in national food security settings.

Microborers, which bore holes less than 100 mu m diameter, are one of the most pervasive agents of bioerosion and are present throughout all calcium carbonate substrates within the reef environment. The response of diverse reef functional groups to OA is known from real-world ecosystems, but to date our understanding of the relationship between ocean pH and carbonate dissolution by microborers is limited to controlled laboratory experiments. Here we examine the settlement of microborers to pure mineral calcium carbonate substrates (calcite) along a natural pH gradient at a volcanically acidified reef at Maug, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). Colonization of pioneer microborers was higher in the lower pH waters near the vent field. Depth of microborer penetration was highly variable both among and within sites (4.2-195.5 mu m) over the short duration of the study (3 mo.) and no clear relationship to increasing CO2 was observed. Calculated rates of biogenic dissolution, however, were highest at the two sites closer to the vent and were not significantly different from each other. These data represent the first evidence of OA-enhancement of microboring flora colonization in newly available substrates and provide further evidence that microborers, especially bioeroding chlorophytes, respond positively to low pH. The accelerated breakdown and dissolution of reef framework structures with OA will likely lead to declines in structural complexity and integrity, as well as possible loss of essential habitat.","[Enochs, Ian C.; Valentino, Lauren; Kolodziej, Graham; Fitchett, Mark D.; Carlton, Renee] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Cswy, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Enochs, Ian C.; Manzello, Derek P.; Valentino, Lauren; Kolodziej, Graham; Carlton, Renee] NOAA, AOML, 4301 Rickenbacker Cswy, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Tribollet, Aline] Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, Lab IPSL, IRD,CNRS,MNHN,LOCEAN, 32 Ave Henri Varagnat, F-93143 Bondy, France; [Donham, Emily M.] Moss Landing Marine Labs, 8272 Moss Landing Rd, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA; [Donham, Emily M.; Price, Nichole N.] Bigelow Lab Ocean Sci, 60 Bigelow Dr, East Boothbay, ME 04544 USA",9,10.1371/journal.pone.0159818,2016

Here, we examine phylogeographic partitions in the sea against a backdrop of biogeographic provinces defined by taxonomy, endemism, and species composition. The taxonomic identities used to define biogeographic provinces are routinely accompanied by diagnostic genetic differences between sister species, indicating interspecific concordance between biogeography and phylogeography. In cases where individual species are distributed across two or more biogeographic provinces, shifts in genotype frequencies often align with biogeographic boundaries, providing intraspecific concordance between biogeography and phylogeography. Here, we provide examples of comparative phylogeography from (i) tropical seas that host the highest marine biodiversity, (ii) temperate seas with high productivity but volatile coastlines, (iii) migratory marine fauna, and (iv) plankton that are the most abundant eukaryotes on earth. Tropical and temperate zones both show impacts of glacial cycles, the former primarily through changing sea levels, and the latter through coastal habitat disruption. The general concordance between biogeography and phylogeography indicates that the population-level genetic divergences observed between provinces are a starting point for macroevolutionary divergences between species. However, isolation between provinces does not account for all marine biodiversity; the remainder arises through alternative pathways, such as ecological speciation and parapatric (semiisolated) divergences within provinces and biodiversity hotspots.","[Bowen, Brian W.; Iacchei, Matthew; Toonen, Robert J.] Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; [Gaither, Michelle R.] Univ Durham, Sch Biol & Biomed Sci, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [DiBattista, Joseph D.] Curtin Univ, Dept Environm & Agr, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Iacchei, Matthew] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Andrews, Kimberly R.] Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Sci, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Grant, W.

Samples were collected at five locations around Cuba. For S. partitus and H. flavolineatum, mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite loci were examined, whereas only mitochondrial DNA polymorphism was analyzed for A. tractus. All three species showed high genetic diversity. Mismatch distribution analyses suggest past population expansion in all species, but at different times in each species. Haplotype network and population genetic analyses suggest that: (1) S. partitus went through a recent population bottleneck in the late Pleistocene, (2) H. flavolineatum went through a population bottleneck but earlier, in the mid-Pleistocene, and (3) A. tractus has had a large and stable population size with coalescence times that go back to the late Pliocene. Genetic polymorphism in H. flavolineatum and A. tractus is homogeneous throughout the archipelago, whereas there is significant genetic structure in S. partitus. Genetic differentiation among S. partitus populations is most likely the result of the combined effects of egg type and oceanic current patterns along the Cuban coast.","[Castellanos-Gell, Jessy; Garcia-Machado, Erik] Univ La Habana, Ctr Invest Marinas, Calle 16,114 Entre 1ra & 3ra, Havana 11300, Cuba; [Robainas-Barcia, Aymee] Pierre Fabre Iber, Calle Ramon Trias Fargas 7-11, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [Pina-Amargos, Fabian] Ctr Invest Ecosistemas Costeros, 69 400 Cayo Coco, Moron, Ciego De Avila, Cuba; [Chevalier-Monteagudo, Pedro] Acuario Nacl Cuba, Calle 60, Havana 11300, Cuba; [Metcalfe, Cushla] CSIRO, 306 Carmody Rd, St Lucia, Qld 4067, Australia; [Molina, Wagner Franco] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Ctr Biociencias, Dept Biol Celular & Genet, BR-59078970 Natal, RN, Brazil; [Casane, Didier] Univ Paris Saclay, Univ Paris Sud, Evolut Genomes Comportement & Ecol, CNRS,IRD, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Casane, Didier] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, F-75205 Paris, France",2,10.1007/s00227-016-2935-6,2016

To ensure MPA efficacy at the design, uptake and management levels, baseline data on fish populations associated with deep nearshore reefs are needed. This study employed baited remote underwater stereo-video systems to investigate fish habitat associations at shallow (11-25 m) and deep (45-75 m) reef sites in the Tsitsikamma National Park MPA, South Africa. The compositions of fish assemblages at shallow and deep reef sites were significantly different. Specifically, rare species, juveniles and low trophic level species dominated the shallow reef, while deep reef assemblages were characterised by large, sexually mature and predatory fish. The body size of abundant species was also correlated with depth, with larger individuals being more abundant on deeper reefs. Habitat types were identified according to a habitat classification system established in a previous study, which resulted in four broad depth separated habitat types (defined by macrobenthos and environmental variables). Canonical analysis of principle coordinates (CAP) indicated that habitat type was a good categorical predictor of the observed fish assemblages. The CAP analysis determined that 86 % of the samples were correctly assigned to the habitat type from which they were collected, indicating that specific fish assemblages were associated with distinct habitat types. This study highlights the importance of protecting both shallow and deep reefs, not only to ensure the conservation of particular fish assemblages, but also to provide protection for all stages of the life cycle of fish species.","[Heyns-Veale, E.

We provide the first evidence of high local retention and limited connectivity among populations spanning 700 km along an open coast in an upwelling system. Using extensive field measurements of fecundity, population size and settlement in concert with a Bayesian inverse modelling approach, we estimated that, on average, Petrolisthes cinctipes larvae disperse only 6.9 km (+/- 25.0 km s.d.) from natal populations, despite spending approximately six weeks in an open-coast system that was once assumed to be broadly dispersive. This estimate differed substantially from our prior dispersal estimate (153.9 km) based on currents and larval duration and behaviour, revealing the importance of employing demographic data in larval dispersal estimates. Based on this estimate, we predict that demographic connectivity occurs predominantly among neighbouring populations less than 30 km apart. Comprehensive studies of larval production, settlement and connectivity are needed to advance an understanding of the ecology and evolution of life in the sea as well as to conserve ecosystems. Our novel approach provides a tractable framework for addressing these questions for species occurring in discrete coastal populations.","[Hameed, Sarah O.; Morgan, Steven G.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Bodega Marine Lab, POB 247, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA; [White, J.

Global change is rapidly altering environmental conditions, but, with the exception of coral microalgae interactions, we know little of how this will affect symbiotic relationships. We here test how the effects of ocean acidification, from rising anthropogenic CO2 emissions, may alter symbiotic interactions between juvenile fish and their jellyfish hosts. Fishes treated with elevated seawater CO2 concentrations, as forecast for the end of the century on a business-as-usual greenhouse gas emission scenario, were negatively affected in their behaviour. The total time that fish (yellowtail scad) spent close to their jellyfish host in a choice arena where they could see and smell their host was approximately three times shorter under future compared with ambient CO2 conditions. Likewise, the mean number of attempts to associate with jellyfish was almost three times lower in CO2-treated compared with control fish, while only 63% (high CO2) versus 86% (control) of all individuals tested initiated an association at all. By contrast, none of three fish species tested were attracted solely to jellyfish olfactory cues under present-day CO2 conditions, suggesting that the altered fish jellyfish association is not driven by negative effects of ocean acidification on olfaction. Because shelter is not widely available in the open water column and larvae of many (and often commercially important) pelagic species associate with jellyfish for protection against predators, modification of the fish jellyfish symbiosis might lead to higher mortality and alter species population dynamics, and potentially have flow-on effects for their fisheries.","[Nagelkerken, Ivan; Rutte, Melchior D.; Geertsma, Robbert C.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci & Environm Inst, Southern Seas Ecol Labs, DX 650 418, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Pitt, Kylie A.] Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Gold Coast Campus, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia; [Pitt, Kylie A.] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst ARI Coast & Estuaries, Gold Coast Campus, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia",3,10.1098/rspb.2016.1146,2016

However, recent research suggests that inverted biomass pyramids (IBPs) characterize relatively pristine reef fish communities. Here, we estimated the slope of a kelp forest fish community biomass spectrum from underwater visual surveys. The observed biomass spectrum slope is strongly positive, reflecting an IBP. This is incongruous with theory because this steep positive slope would only be expected if trophic position decreased with increasing body size (consumer-to-resource mass ratio, less than 1). We then used delta N-15 signatures of fish muscle tissue to quantify the relationship between trophic position and body size and instead detected strong evidence for the opposite, with PPMR 1650 (50% credible interval 280-12 000). The natural history of kelp forest reef fishes suggests that this paradox could arise from energetic subsidies in the form of movement of mobile consumers across habitats, and from seasonally pulsed production inputs at small body sizes. There were four to five times more biomass at large body sizes (1-2 kg) than would be expected in a closed steady-state community providing a measure of the magnitude of subsidies.","[Trebilcou, Rowan; Dulvy, Nicholas K.; Anderson, Sean C.] Simon Fraser Univ, Earth Ocean Res Grp, Biol Sci, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Salomon, Anne K.] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Trebilcou, Rowan] Univ Tasmania, Antarctic Climate & Ecosyst Cooperat Res Ctr, Private Bag 80, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",11,10.1098/rspb.2016.0816,2016

Broadly, we found reef fish species richness, abundance and biomass declining with depth. At the trophic group level we identified declines in herbivores (both total and relative community biomass) with depth, mostly driven by declines in parrotfish (Scaridae). Piscivores increased as a proportion of the community with increased depth while, in contrast to previous studies, we found no change in relative planktivorous reef fish biomass across the depth gradient. In addition, we also found evidence of ontogenetic migrations in the blue tang (Acanthurus coeruleus), striped parrotfish (Scarus iserti), blue chromis (Chromis cyanea), creole wrasse (Clepticus parrae), bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum) and yellowtail snapper (Ocyurus chrysurus), with a higher proportion of larger individuals at mesophotic and near-mesophotic depths than on shallow reefs. Our results highlight the importance of using biomass measures when considering fish community changes across depth gradients, with biomass generating different results to simple abundance counts.","[Andradi-Brown, Dominic A.; Rogers, Alex D.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Tinbergen Bldg,South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Andradi-Brown, Dominic A.; Gress, Erika; Wright, Georgina; Exton, Dan A.] Operat Wallacea, Wallace House, Spilsby PE23 4EX, Lincs, England",20,10.1371/journal.pone.0156641,2016

The high-resolution delta C-13 profiles of samples from the inner shell layer on cross-sections fall within similar narrow ranges and display no regular variations or trends, such as an ontogenetic trend or abrupt short-term drops likely to be related to reproductive activity. This suggests that the calcification site of this species is not likely affected by photosynthetic CO2 uptake or CO2 incorporation during respiration. The delta O-18 profiles show distinct seasonal cycles. The intraspecific variability in the delta O-18 values is small in parts of the shell precipitated in the adult stage, but is not negligible in the juvenile and senescent stages. The differences in the monthly and seasonally resolved delta O-18 values among shells are less than 0.51 parts per thousand and 0.76 parts per thousand, respectively. The shell delta O-18 values are nearly identical or close to the delta O-18 values for aragonite precipitated in oxygen isotope equilibrium with ambient seawater (delta O-18(EA)). The largest differences between the shell delta O-18 and delta O-18(EA) values calculated from the monthly and seasonally resolved data correspond to an overestimate of the seawater temperature by as much as 1.7 degrees C and 2.3 degrees C, respectively. However, these differences are smaller in the adult stage (<0.25%) than in the other stages. This small difference allows an accurate reconstruction of the seawater temperature with an error of <1.1 degrees C. Consequently, we recommend that multiple shell records be obtained because of the non-negligible intraspecific variations in their delta O-18 values. Growth banding, composed of alternating narrow white bands and wide light-grey bands, is discernible on cross-sections of the inner shell layer. The delta O-18(shell) data indicate that they were formed in winter and the other seasons, respectively.","[Yamanashi, Junpei; Takayanagi, Hideko; Iryu, Yasufumi] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Inst Geol & Paleontol, Sendai, Miyagi 980, Japan; [Isaji, Ayaka] Nagoya Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Asami, Ryuji] Univ Ryukyus, Fac Sci, Dept Earth Sci, 1 Senbaru, Nishihara, Okinawa 90301, Japan",1,10.1371/journal.pone.0157659,2016

Although broad-scale movement of larvae associated with these features can be captured in biophysical models, direct evidence of processes influencing survival within them, and subsequent effects on population replenishment, are unknown. We sequentially sampled cohorts of coral reef fishes in the plankton and nearshore juvenile habitats in the Straits of Florida and used otolith microstructure analysis to compare growth and size-at-age of larvae collected inside and outside of mesoscale eddies to those that survived to settlement. Larval habitat altered patterns of growth and selective mortality: Thalassoma bifasciatum and Cryptotomus roseus that encountered eddies in the plankton grew faster than larvae outside of eddies and likely experienced higher survival to settlement. During warm periods, T. bifasciatum residing outside of eddies in the oligotrophic Florida Current experienced high mortality and only the slowest growers survived early larval life. Such slow growth is advantageous in nutrient poor habitats when warm temperatures increase metabolic demands but is insufficient for survival beyond the larval stage because only fast-growing larvae successfully settled to reefs. Because larvae arriving to the Straits of Florida from distant sources must spend long periods of time outside of eddies, our results indicate that they have a survival disadvantage. High productivity features such as eddies not only enhance the survival of pelagic larvae, but also potentially increase the contribution of locally spawned larvae to reef populations.","[Shulzitski, Kathryn; Sponaugle, Su; Hauff, Martha; Walter, Kristen D.; Cowen, Robert K.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Marine Biol & Ecol, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Sponaugle, Su; Cowen, Robert K.] Oregon State Univ, Hatfield Marine Sci Ctr, Newport, OR 97365 USA; [Hauff, Martha] Stonehill Coll, Dept Biol, N Easton, MA 02357 USA",13,10.1073/pnas.1601606113,2016

Often, fish abundance appears stable at one spatial scale (e.g. reef-wide), but exhibits substantial change at finer scales (e.g. site-specific decline or increase). Taxonomic resolution also plays a role; overall stability at coarse taxonomic levels (e.g. family) may mask species-level turnover. Here we document changes to reef fish communities after severe Tropical Cyclone Ita crossed Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef. Coral and reef fish surveys were conducted concurrently before and after the cyclone at four levels of exposure to the prevailing weather. Coral cover declined across all exposures except sheltered sites, with the largest decline at exposed sites. There was no significant overall reduction in the total density, biomass and species richness of reef fishes between 2011 and 2015, but individual fish taxa (families and species) changed in complex and unpredictable ways. For example, more families increased in density and biomass than decreased following Cyclone Ita, particularly at exposed sites whilst more fish families declined at lagoon sites even though coral cover did not decline. All sites lost biomass of several damselfish species, and at most sites there was an increase in macroinvertivores and grazers. Overall, these results suggest that the degree of change measured at coarse taxonomic levels masked high species-level turnover, although other potential explanations include that there was no impact of the storm, fish assemblages were impacted but underwent rapid recovery or that there is a time lag before the full impacts become apparent. This study confirms that in high-complexity, high diversity ecosystems such as coral reefs, species level analyses are essential to adequately capture the consequences of disturbance events.","[Ceccarelli, Daniela M.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Emslie, Michael J.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, TMC, PMB 3, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Richards, Zoe T.] Western Australian Museum, Dept Aquat Zool, 49 Kew St, Perth, WA 6016, Australia",11,10.1371/journal.pone.0156232,2016

In a replicated experiment using a novel approach allowing within-site comparison, we examined changes in immigration rate following the gradual removal of territorial damselfish from a limited area within a much larger patch of continuous habitat. In all sites, immigration occurred at intermediate densities but did not occur before the start of removals and only rarely as density approached zero. In the combined data and in 5 of 7 sites, the number of immigrants was a hump-shaped function of density. This is the first experimental evidence for hump-shaped, density-dependent immigration. This pattern may be more widespread than previously recognized because studies over more limited density ranges have identified positive density dependence at low densities and negative density dependence at high densities. Positive density dependence at low density can arise from limits to the number of potential immigrants and from behavioral preferences for settling near conspecifics. Negative density dependence at high density can arise from competition for resources, especially high quality territories. The potential for non-linear effects of local density on immigration needs to be recognized for robust predictions of conservation reserve function, harvest impacts, pest control, and the dynamics of fragmented populations.","[Turgeon, Katrine; Kramer, Donald L.] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, 1205 Docteur Penfield Ave, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada",1,10.1371/journal.pone.0156417,2016

Although anemonefishes and their host anemones are iconic mutualists and widely sought by ornamental fisheries, the degree to which anemones depend on anemonefishes, and thus the colony-level effects of collecting anemonefishes, is not well understood. We tracked the size and abundance of anemone Entacmaea quadricolor and anemonefish Amphiprion melanopus colonies for 3 yr after none, some, or all of the resident anemonefish were experimentally removed. Total and partial removal of anemonefish had rapid and sustained negative effects on growth, reproduction and survival of anemones, as well as cascading effects on recruitment and productivity of anemonefish in the remaining colony. As predicted, total removal of anemonefish caused acute declines in size and abundance of anemones, although most anemone colonies (76 %) slowly resumed growth and reproduction after the arrival of anemonefish recruits, which subsequently grew and defended the hosts. Partial removal of anemonefish had similar but typically less severe effects on anemones. Remarkably, the colony-level effects on anemones and anemonefish were proportional to the size and number of anemonefish that were experimentally removed. In particular, anemone survival and anemonefish productivity were highest when one or more adult anemonefish remained in the colony, suggesting that adult fish not only enhanced the protection of anemones, but also increased the recruitment and/or survival of conspecifics. We conclude that the relationship between E. quadricolor and A. melanopus is not only obligate, but also demographically rigid and easily perturbed by anemonefish fisheries. Clearly, these two species must be managed together as a unit and with utmost precaution. To this end, we propose several tangible management actions that will help to minimize fishing effects.","[Frisch, Ashley J.; Rizzari, Justin R.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Rizzari, Justin R.; Munkres, Katherine P.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Hobbs, Jean-Paul A.] Curtin Univ, Dept Environm & Agr, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",20,10.1007/s00338-016-1401-8,2016

To understand the role and consequences of this extreme life history in shaping coral reef fish populations, we quantitatively documented the structure of small reef fish populations over a 26-month period (> 14 short-lived fish generations) at an inshore reef on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Most species with life spans > 1 yr, such as pomacentrids, exhibited a peak in recruitment during the austral summer, driving seasonal changes in the small fish community composition. In contrast, there were no clear changes in goby community composition, despite the abundance of short-lived, high turnover species. Species of Eviota, the most abundant gobiid genus observed, showed remarkably similar demographic profiles year-round, with consistent densities of adults as well as recently recruited juveniles. Our results demonstrate ongoing recruitment of these small cryptic fishes, which appears to compensate for an exceptionally short life span on the reef. Our results suggest that gobiid populations are able to overcome demographic limitations, and by maintaining reproduction, larval survival and recruitment throughout the year, they may avoid population bottlenecks. These findings also underline the potential trophodynamic importance of these small species; because of this constant turnover, Eviota species and other short-lived fishes may be particularly valuable contributors to the flow of energy on coral reefs, underpinning the year-round trophic structure.","[Lefevre, Carine D.; Nash, Kirsty L.; Gonzalez-Cabello, Alonso; Bellwood, David R.] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Lefevre, Carine D.; Nash, Kirsty L.; Gonzalez-Cabello, Alonso; Bellwood, David R.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",9,10.1007/s00338-016-1406-3,2016

Mortality on coral reefs is intrinsically linked with predation, with most evidence suggesting that predation is highest during crepuscular periods. We tested this hypothesis using passive acoustic telemetry data to determine the time of day of potential mortality events (PMEs) of adult herbivorous reef fishes. A total of 94 fishes were tagged with acoustic transmitters, of which 43 exhibited a PME. Furthermore, we identified five categories of PMEs based on the nature of change in acoustic signal detections from tagged fishes. The majority of PMEs were characterised by an abrupt stop in detections, possibly as a result of a large, mobile predator. Overall, mortality rates were estimated to be approximately 59 % per year using passive acoustic telemetry. The time of day of PMEs suggests that predation was highest during the day and crepuscular periods and lowest at night, offering only partial support for the crepuscular predation hypothesis. Visually oriented, diurnal and crepuscular predators appear to be more important than their nocturnal counterparts in terms of predation on adult reef fishes. By timing PMEs, passive acoustic telemetry may offer an important new tool for investigating the nature of predation on coral reefs.","[Khan, J. A.; Welsh, J. Q.; Bellwood, D.

However, overfishing has skewed sex ratios of Atlantic parrotfishes because fishing has disproportionate impacts on larger individuals, and males are generally larger than females. Whether protection from fishing may allow sex ratios to return to equilibrium is unknown, as fishing can induce irreversible ecological and/or evolutionary shifts. Bermuda banned trap fishing in 1990, creating a unique opportunity to analyse long-term responses of Atlantic parrotfishes to release from fishing. We found that sex ratios of four common parrotfishes were initially skewed, with male proportions ranging from 0.04 to 0.18. However, male proportions rebounded within 3-4 yr, equilibrating at values ranging from 0.36 to 0.54, similar to those reported at unfished sites in the region.

The mechanism(s) that cause such shifts in population structure are unclear, but it is possible that young fish preferentially settle into microhabitats where cleaner wrasse are present. As a first step to investigate this possibility, we conducted aquarium experiments to examine whether settlement-stage and young juveniles of ambon damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis, selected a microhabitat near a cleaner wrasse (adult or juvenile). Both settlement-stage (0 d post-settlement) and juvenile (similar to 5 weeks post-settlement) fish spent a greater proportion of time in a microhabitat adjacent to L. dimidiatus than in one next to a control fish (a non-cleaner wrasse, Halichoeres melanurus) or one where no fish was present. This suggests that cleaner wrasse may serve as a positive cue during microhabitat selection. We also conducted focal observations of cleaner wrasse and counts of nearby damselfishes (1 m radius) to examine whether newly settled fish obtained direct benefits, in the form of cleaning services, from being near a cleaner wrasse. Although abundant, newly settled recruits (< 20 mm total length) were rarely (2 %) observed being cleaned in 20 min observations compared with larger damselfishes (58 %). Individual damselfish that were cleaned were significantly larger than the median size of the surrounding nearby non-cleaned conspecifics; this was consistent across four species. The selection by settlement-stage fish of a microhabitat adjacent to cleaner wrasse in the laboratory, despite only being rarely cleaned in the natural environment, suggests that even rare cleaning events and/or indirect benefits may drive their settlement choices. This behaviour may also explain the decreased abundance of young fishes on reefs from which cleaner wrasse had been experimentally removed. This study reinforces the potentially important role of mutualism during the processes of settlement and recruitment of young reef fishes.","[Sun, D.; Cheney, K. L.; Werminghausen, J.; McClure, E.

Divergence, both within and between populations of marine taxa, is not uncommon, but spatial and temporal stability of observed genetic structure is not well known. Previously, we detected large genetic differences among populations of the cardinalfish species Ostorhinchus doederleini inhabiting adjacent coral reefs. Here, we determined the spatial and temporal persistence of these genetic structures over the course of ten consecutive generations. Using microsatellite markers, we detected large changes (genetic population distance, D (est), ranged from 0.04 to 0.46) in the genetic structure in some years, but some reefs maintained the same populations for nearly all sampling years. As this species' life span does not exceed 1 yr, persistence of distinct reef populations suggests natal homing. Mitochondrial identity based on two mtDNA markers corroborates the nuclear genetic evidence for genetic differences large enough to constitute different clades and even cryptic species in O. doederleini, which, based on gross morphology, was thought to be a single taxon. Habitat specialization was observed in one clade that exclusively inhabited reef lagoons, while all clades could be observed on reef slopes. We suggest that local habitat recognition combined with local population recognition and selection against hybrids can form barriers that maintain a cryptic species complex.","[Gerlach, Gabriele; Deister, Fabian; Mueller, Anke] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; [Atema, Jelle] Boston Univ, Marine Program, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Raupach, Michael J.] German Ctr Marine Biodivers Res, Senckenberg Meer, D-26382 Wilhelmshaven, Germany; [Gerlach, Gabriele; Kingsford, Michael J.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Gerlach, Gabriele; Kingsford, Michael J.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia",4,10.1007/s00338-015-1395-7,2016

Due to their large size and conspicuous predatory behaviour, reef sharks are typically assumed to be apex predators, but their functional role is yet to be confirmed. In this study, we used stomach contents and stable isotopes to estimate diet, trophic position and carbon sources for three common species of reef shark (Triaenodon obesus, Carcharhinus melanopterus and C. amblyrhynchos) from the Great Barrier Reef (Australia) and evaluated their assumed functional role as apex predators by qualitative and quantitative comparisons with other sharks and large predatory fishes. We found that reef sharks do not occupy the apex of coral reef food chains, but instead have functional roles similar to those of large predatory fishes such as snappers, emperors and groupers, which are typically regarded as high-level mesopredators. We hypothesise that a degree of functional redundancy exists within this guild of predators, potentially explaining why shark-induced trophic cascades are rare or subtle in coral reef ecosystems. We also found that reef sharks participate in multiple food webs (pelagic and benthic) and are sustained by multiple sources of primary production. We conclude that large conspicuous predators, be they elasmobranchs or any other taxon, should not axiomatically be regarded as apex predators without thorough analysis of their diet. In the case of reef sharks, our dietary analyses suggest they should be reassigned to an alternative trophic group such as high-level mesopredators. This change will facilitate improved understanding of how reef communities function and how removal of predators (e.g., via fishing) might affect ecosystem properties.","[Frisch, Ashley J.; Rizzari, Justin R.] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Ireland, Matthew; Rizzari, Justin R.; Lonnstedt, Oona M.; Magnenat, Katalin A.; Mirbach, Christopher E.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Lonnstedt, Oona M.] Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Genet, Limnol, Uppsala, Sweden; [Hobbs, Jean-Paul A.] Curtin Univ, Dept Environm & Agr, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",13,10.1007/s00338-016-1415-2,2016

Patch reefs were constructed to simulate two types of reefs: present-day reefs that are vulnerable to climate-induced coral bleaching, and reefs with more bleaching-robust coral taxa, thereby simulating the likely future of coral reefs under a warming climate.

Climate-robust reefs had lower total species richness of coral-reef fishes than climate-vulnerable reefs, but total fish abundance was not significantly different between reef types (pooled across all species and life-history stages). The nature of aggressive interactions, measured as the number of aggressive chases, varied according to coral composition; on climate-robust reefs, juveniles used the substratum less often to avoid aggression from competitors, and interspecific aggression became relatively more frequent than intraspecific aggression for juveniles of the coral-obligate P. moluccensis.

Adult breeding pairs were maintained at current-day control (446 mu atm), moderate (652 mu atm) or high CO2 (912 mu atm) for a 9-month period that included the summer breeding season. The elevated CO2 treatments were consistent with CO2 levels projected by 2100 under moderate (RCP6) and high (RCP8) emission scenarios. Reproductive output increased in A. percula, with 45-75 % more egg clutches produced and a 47-56 % increase in the number of eggs per clutch in the two elevated CO2 treatments. In contrast, reproductive output decreased at high CO2 in Ac. polyacanthus, with approximately one-third as many clutches produced compared with controls. Egg survival was not affected by CO2 for A. percula, but was greater in elevated CO2 for Ac. polyacanthus. Hatching success was also greater for Ac. polyacanthus at elevated CO2, but there was no effect of CO2 treatments on offspring size. Despite the variation in reproductive output, body condition of adults did not differ between control and CO2 treatments in either species. Our results demonstrate different effects of high CO2 on fish reproduction, even among species within the same family. A greater understanding of the variation in effects of ocean acidification on reproductive performance is required to predict the consequences for future populations of marine organisms.","[Welch, Megan J.; Munday, Philip L.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Welch, Megan J.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",5,10.1007/s00338-015-1385-9,2016

Here, we demonstrate density-associated processes in two scleractinian populations on the outer reef of Moorea, French Polynesia, that are rapidly increasing in size following the effects of two catastrophic disturbances. Between 2006 and 2010, predation by the corallivorous crown-of-thorns sea star reduced coral cover by 93 %; in 2010, the dead coral skeletons were removed by a cyclone, and in 2011 and 2012, high coral recruitment initiated population recovery. Coral recruitment was associated with coral cover, but the relationship differed between two coral genera that are almost exclusively broadcast spawners in Moorea. Acroporids recruited at low densities, and the density of recruits was positively associated with cover of Acropora, whereas pocilloporids recruited at high densities, and densities of their recruits were negatively associated with cover of Pocillopora. Together, our results suggest that associations between adult cover and density of both juveniles and recruits can mediate rapid coral community recovery after large disturbances. The difference between taxa in sign of the relationships between recruit density and coral cover indicate that they reflect contrasting mechanisms with the potential to mediate temporal shifts in taxonomic composition of coral communities.","[Bramanti, Lorenzo] Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, Observ Oceanol,CNRS, Lab Ecogeochim Environm Benth LECOB UMR8222, F-66650 Banyuls Sur Mer, France; [Bramanti, Lorenzo; Edmunds, Peter J.] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, 18111 Nordhoff St, Northridge, CA 91330 USA",21,10.1007/s00338-016-1413-4,2016

While cyclones are a natural element of the disturbance regime of coral reefs, the role of temporal clustering has previously been overlooked. Here, we examine the consequences of different types of cyclone temporal distributions (clustered, stochastic or regular) on reef ecosystems. We subdivided the GBR into 14 adjoining regions, each spanning roughly 300 km, and quantified both the rate and clustering of cyclones using dispersion statistics. To interpret the consequences of such cyclone variability for coral reef health, we used a model of observed coral population dynamics. Results showed that clustering occurs on the margins of the cyclone belt, being strongest in the southern reefs and the far northern GBR, which also has the lowest cyclone rate. In the central GBR, where rates were greatest, cyclones had a relatively regular temporal pattern. Modelled dynamics of the dominant coral genus, Acropora, suggest that the long-term average cover might be more than 13 % greater (in absolute cover units) under a clustered cyclone regime compared to stochastic or regular regimes. Thus, not only does cyclone clustering vary significantly along the GBR but such clustering is predicted to have a marked, and management-relevant, impact on the status of coral populations. Additionally, we use our regional clustering and rate results to sample from a library of over 7000 synthetic cyclone tracks for the GBR. This allowed us to provide robust reef-scale maps of annual cyclone frequency and cyclone impacts on Acropora. We conclude that assessments of coral reef vulnerability need to account for both spatial and temporal cyclone distributions.","[Wolff, Nicholas H.; Wong, Aaron; Stolberg, Kristin; Mumby, Peter J.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Wolff, Nicholas H.; Mumby, Peter J.] Univ Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Vitolo, Renato] Univ Siena, Complex Syst Community, Via Roma 56, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Anthony, Kenneth R.

We evaluated temporal and species-specific variability in the relative importance of N and P limitation among tropical macroalgae in two-factor experiments conducted twice after rains and twice after dry conditions to explore potential linkages to environmental drivers. We studied three common macroalgal species with varying ecological strategies: a fast-growing opportunist, Dictyota bartayresiana; and two calcifying species likely to be slower growing, Galaxaura fasciculata and Padina boryana. On the scale of days to weeks, nutrient responses ranged among and within species from no limitation to increases in growth by 20 and 40 % over controls in 3 d with N and P addition, respectively. After light rain or dry conditions, Dictyota grew rapidly (up to similar to 60 % in 3 d) with little indication of nutrient limitation, while Padina and Galaxaura shifted between N, P, or no limitation. All species grew slowly or lost mass after a large storm, presumably due to unfavorable conditions on the reef prior to the experiment that limited nutrient uptake. Padina and Galaxaura both became nutrient limited 3 d post-storm, while Dictyota did not. These results suggest that differing capabilities for nutrient uptake and storage dictate the influence of nutrient history and thus drive nutrient responses and, in doing so, may allow species with differing ecological strategies to coexist in a fluctuating environment. Moreover, the great variability in species' responses indicates that patterns of nutrient limitation are more complex than previously recognized, and generalizations about N versus P limitation of a given system may not convey the inherent complexity in governing conditions and processes.","[Clausing, Rachel J.; Fong, Peggy] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Charles E Young Dr South, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",4,10.1007/s00338-016-1403-6,2016

While the Red Sea harbors one of the longest connected reef systems in the world, detailed calcification data are only available from the northernmost part. To fill this knowledge gap, we measured in situ calcification rates of primary and secondary reef builders in the central Red Sea. We collected data on the major habitat-forming coral genera Porites, Acropora, and Pocillopora and also on calcareous crusts (CC) in a spatio-seasonal framework. The scope of the study comprised sheltered and exposed sites of three reefs along a cross-shelf gradient and over four seasons of the year. Calcification of all coral genera was consistent across the shelf and highest in spring. In addition, Pocillopora showed increased calcification at exposed reef sites. In contrast, CC calcification increased from nearshore, sheltered to offshore, exposed reef sites, but also varied over seasons. Comparing our data to other reef locations, calcification in the Red Sea was in the range of data collected from reefs in the Caribbean and Indo-Pacific; however, Acropora calcification estimates were at the lower end of worldwide rates. Our study shows that the increasing coral cover from nearshore to offshore environments aligned with CC calcification but not coral calcification, highlighting the potentially important role of CC in structuring reef cover and habitats. While coral calcification maxima have been typically observed during summer in many reef locations worldwide, calcification maxima during spring in the central Red Sea indicate that summer temperatures exceed the optima of reef calcifiers in this region. This study provides a foundation for comparative efforts and sets a baseline to quantify impact of future environmental change in the central Red Sea.","[Roik, Anna; Roder, Cornelia; Rothig, Till; Voolstra, Christian R.] KAUST, Red Sea Res Ctr, Bldg 2,Level 2, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia",16,10.1007/s00338-015-1383-y,2016

Changes in environmental conditions due to coastal development, climate change, and ocean acidification may pose a threat to net carbonate production in the near future. Controlled laboratory studies demonstrate that calcification by corals and coralline algae is sensitive to changes in aragonite saturation state (a""broken vertical bar(a)), as well as temperature, light, and nutrition. Studies also show that the dissolution rate of carbonate substrates is impacted by changes in carbonate chemistry. The sensitivity of coral reefs to these parameters must be confirmed and quantified in the natural environment in order to predict how coral reefs will respond to local and global changes, particularly ocean acidification. We estimated the daytime hourly net community metabolic rates, both net community calcification (NCC) and net community productivity (NCP), at Sheltered Reef, an offshore platform reef in the central Red Sea. Average NCC was 8 +/- A 3 mmol m(-2) h(-1) in December 2010 and 11 +/- A 1 mmol m(-2) h(-1) in May 2011, and NCP was 21 +/- A 7 mmol m(-2) h(-1) in December 2010 and 44 +/- A 4 mmol m(-2) h(-1) in May 2011. We also monitored a suite of physical and chemical properties to help relate the rates at Sheltered Reef to published rates from other sites. While previous research shows that short-term field studies investigating the NCC-a""broken vertical bar(a) relationship have differing results due to confounding factors, it is important to continue estimating NCC in different places, seasons, and years, in order to monitor changes in NCC versus a""broken vertical bar in space and time, and to ultimately resolve a broader understanding of this relationship.","[Bernstein, W.

We investigated growth, photosynthesis and calcification of early epilithic algal community assemblages exposed for 6 months to four temperature profiles (-1.1, +/- 0.0, +0.9, +1.6 A degrees C) that were crossed with four carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO(2)) levels (360, 440, 650, 940 A mu atm), under flow-through conditions and natural light regimes. Additionally, we compared the cover of heavily calcified crustose coralline algae (CCA) and lightly calcified red algae of the genus Peyssonnelia among treatments. Increase in cover of epilithic communities showed optima under moderately elevated temperatures and present pCO(2), while cover strongly decreased under high temperatures and high-pCO(2) conditions, particularly due to decreasing cover of CCA. Similarly, community calcification rates were strongly decreased at high pCO(2) under both measured temperatures. While final cover of CCA decreased under high temperature and pCO(2) (additive negative effects), cover of Peyssonnelia spp. increased at high compared to annual average and moderately elevated temperatures. Thus, cover of Peyssonnelia spp. increased in treatment combinations with less CCA, which was supported by a significant negative correlation between organism groups. The different susceptibility to stressors most likely derived from a different calcification intensity and/or mineral. Notably, growth of the epilithic communities and final cover of CCA were strongly decreased under reduced-pCO(2) conditions compared to the present. Thus, CCA may have acclimatized from past to present-day pCO(2) conditions, and changes in carbonate chemistry, regardless in which direction, negatively affect them. However, if epilithic organisms cannot further acclimatize to OW and OA, the interacting effects of both factors may change epilithic communities in the future, thereby likely leading to reduced reef stability and recovery.","[Vogel, N.; Cantin, N.

The chief detrimental factors are increased temperature and increased pCO(2). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of these two stressors operating independently and in unison on the biological response of common Hawaiian reef corals. Manipulative experiments were performed using five species (Porites compressa, Pocillopora damicornis, Fungia scutaria, Montipora capitata, and Leptastrea purpurea) in a continuous-flow mesocosm system under natural sunlight conditions. Corals were grown together as a community under treatments of high temperature (2 A degrees C above normal maximum summer temperature), high pCO(2) (twice present-day conditions), and with both factors acting in unison. Control corals were grown under present-day pCO(2) and at normal summer temperatures. Leptastrea purpurea proved to be an extremely hardy coral. No change in calcification or mortality occurred under treatments of high temperature, high pCO(2), or combined high temperature-high pCO(2). The remaining four species showed reduced calcification in the high-temperature treatment. Two species (L. purpurea and M. capitata) showed no response to increased pCO(2). Also, high pCO(2) ameliorated the negative effect of high temperature on the calcification rates of P. damicornis. Mortality was driven primarily by high temperature, with a negative synergistic effect in P. compressa only in the high-pCO(2)-high-temperature treatment. Results support the observation that biological response to temperature and pCO(2) elevation is highly species-specific, so generalizations based on response of a single species might not apply to a diverse and complex coral reef community.","[Bahr, Keisha D.; Jokiel, Paul L.; Rodgers, Ku'ulei S.] Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, POB 1346, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA",7,10.1007/s00338-016-1405-4,2016

The net production of CaCO3 will likely decline in the future, from both declining net calcification rates (decreasing calcification and increasing dissolution) and shifts in benthic community composition from calcifying organisms to non-calcifying organisms. Here, we present a framework for hydrochemical studies that allows both declining net calcification rates and changes in benthic community composition to be incorporated into projections of coral reef CaCO3 production. The framework involves upscaling net calcification rates for each benthic community type using mapped proportional cover of the benthic communities. This upscaling process was applied to the reef flats at One Tree and Lady Elliot reefs (Great Barrier Reef) and Shiraho Reef (Okinawa), and compared to existing data. Future CaCO3 budgets were projected for Lady Elliot Reef, predicting a decline of 53 % from the present value by end-century (800 ppm CO2) without any changes to benthic community composition. A further 5.7 % decline in net CaCO3 production is expected for each 10 % decline in calcifier cover, and net dissolution is predicted by end-century if calcifier cover drops below 18 % of the present extent. These results show the combined negative effect of both declining net calcification rates and changing benthic community composition on reefs and the importance of considering both processes for determining future reef CaCO3 production.","[Shaw, Emily C.; Phinn, Stuart R.] Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Remote Sensing Res Ctr, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Shaw, Emily C.] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; [Hamylton, Sarah M.] Univ Wollongong, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",4,10.1007/s00338-016-1407-2,2016

For marine organisms like fish, the spatial scale of connectivity is generally set by a pelagic larval phase. This has complicated past estimates of connectivity because detailed information on larval movements are difficult to obtain. Genetic approaches provide a tractable alternative and have the added benefit of estimating directly the reproductive isolation of populations. In this study, we leveraged empirical estimates of genetic differentiation among populations with simulations and a meta-analysis to provide a general estimate of the spatial scale of genetic connectivity in marine environments. We used neutral genetic markers to first quantify the genetic differentiation of ecologically-isolated adult populations of a land dwelling fish, the Pacific leaping blenny (Alticus arnoldorum), where marine larval dispersal is the only probable means of connectivity among populations. We then compared these estimates to simulations of a range of marine dispersal scenarios and to collated F-ST and distance data from the literature for marine fish across diverse spatial scales. We found genetic connectivity at sea was extensive among marine populations and in the case of A. arnoldorum, apparently little affected by the presence of ecological barriers. We estimated that similar to 5000 km (with broad confidence intervals ranging from 810-11,692 km) was the spatial scale at which evolutionarily meaningful barriers to gene flow start to occur at sea, although substantially shorter distances are also possible for some taxa. In general, however, such a large estimate of connectivity has important implications for the evolutionary and conservation potential of many marine fish communities.","[Cooke, Georgina M.; Sherwin, William B.; Ord, Terry J.] Univ New S Wales, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Kensington, NSW 2052, Australia; [Cooke, Georgina M.] Australian Museum, Australian Museum Res Inst, Ichthyol, 6 Coll St, Sydney, NSW 2010, Australia; [Schlub, Timothy E.] Univ Sydney, Sydney Sch Publ Hlth, Sydney Med Sch, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",5,10.1371/journal.pone.0150991,2016

We modeled temporal trends in perceived catch per unit effort (CPUE) based on fishers' reports of typical good days' catches using Generalized Linear Mixed Modelling. Fifty-nine different finfish disappeared from catches between the 1950s and 2014; 42 fish were identified to species level, two to genus, seven to family and eight to local name only. Five species occurring at all sites with the greatest number of fishers reporting zero catches were the green bumphead parrotfish (Bolbometopon muricatum), humphead wrasse (Cheilinus undulatus), African pompano (Alectis ciliaris), giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus) and mangrove red snapper (Lutjanus argentimaculatus).

These declines were mainly associated with excess and uncontrolled fishing, fish life-history traits like maximum body size and socio-economic factors like access to market infrastructure and services, and overpopulation.

In tropical systems, these changes are predicted to increase the metabolic demand of coral reef fish larvae while also altering the plankton communities upon which the larvae feed during their pelagic phase. The consequences of these predictions remain speculative in the absence of empirical data on the interactive effects of warm temperatures on the metabolism, postprandial processes and growth responses of coral reef fish larvae. Here, we tested the effect of increased temperature on the metabolism, postprandial performance and fine-scale growth patterns of a coral reef fish (Amphiprion percula) in the latter half of its similar to 11-d larval phase. First, we measured the length and weight of fed versus fasted larvae (N = 340; mean body mass 4.1 +/- 0.05 mg) across fine temporal scales at a typical current summer temperature (28.5 degrees C) and a temperature that is likely be encountered during warm summer periods later this century (31.5 degrees C). Second, we measured routine metabolic rate (Mo-2 routine) and the energetics of the postprandial processes (i.e., digestion, absorption and assimilation of a meal; termed specific dynamic action (SDA)) at both temperatures. Larvae fed voraciously when provided with food for a 12-hour period and displayed a temperature-independent increase in mass of 40.1% (28.5 degrees C) and 42.6%(31.5 degrees C), which was largely associated with the mass of prey in the gut. A subsequent 12-h fasting period revealed that the larvae had grown 21.2 +/- 4.8% (28.5 degrees C) and 22.8 +/- 8.8% (31.5 degrees C) in mass and 10.3 +/- 2.0% (28.5 degrees C) and 7.8 +/- 2.6% (31.5 degrees C) in length compared with pre-feeding values (no significant temperature effect). Mo2 routine was 55 +/- 16% higher at 31.5 degrees C and peak Mo-2 during the postprandial period was 28 +/- 11% higher at 31.5 degrees C, yet elevated temperature had no significant effect on SDA (0.51 +/- 0.06 J at 28.5 degrees C vs. 0.53 +/- 0.07 J at 31.5 degrees C), SDA duration (6.0 +/- 0.6 h vs. 6.5 +/- 0.5 h), or the percent of total meal energy used for SDA (SDA coefficient: 10.1 +/- 1.3% vs. 13.0 +/- 1.7%). Our findings of higher Mo-2 routine but similar SDA coefficient at high temperature provide the first empirical evidence that coral reef fish larvae may have to secure more food to attain similar growth rates during warm summer periods, and perhaps with chronically warmer conditions associated with climate change.","[McLeod, Ian M.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Ctr Trop Water & Aquat Ecosyst Res TropWATER, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [McLeod, Ian M.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Clark, Timothy D.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, PMB 3, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Clark, Timothy D.] AIMS JCU, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Clark, Timothy D.] Univ Tasmania, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Clark, Timothy D.] CSIRO Agr Flagship, Hobart, Tas, Australia",2,10.1371/journal.pone.0155360,2016

The oceanic whitetip shark, Carcharhinus longimanus, is a highly migratory, large-bodied, pelagic shark listed by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Red List as ""vulnerable"" throughout its range and ""critically endangered"" in the western north Atlantic. In 2014, the species was protected globally under Appendix II of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species), limiting and regulating trade. This study used partial sequences of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region to determine the population genetic structure of oceanic whitetip sharks across the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. 724 base pairs were obtained from 215 individuals that identifed nine polymorphic sites and defined 12 distinct haplotypes. Total nucleotide diversity (pi) was 0.0013 and haplotype diversity (h) was 0.5953. The Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) evidenced moderate levels of population structure (phi(ST) = 0.1039) with restricted gene flow between the western and eastern Atlantic Ocean, and a strong relationship between the latter region and the Indian Ocean. Even though the oceanic whitetip is a highly migratory animal the results presented here show that their genetic variability is slightly below average of other pelagic sharks. Additionally, this study recommends that at least two populations in the Atlantic Ocean should be considered distinct (eastern and western Atlantic) and conservation efforts should be focused in areas with the greatest genetic diversity by environmental managers.","[Camargo, Samia M.; Oliveira, Claudio; Foresti, Fausto] Univ Estadual Paulista, UNESP, Inst Biociencias Botucatu, Lab Biol & Genet Peixes, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Coelho, Rui; Santos, Miguel N.] IPMA, Olhao, Portugal; [Coelho, Rui] Univ Algarve, Ctr Ciencias Mar CCMAR, Faro, Portugal; [Chapman, Demian] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Howey-Jordan, Lucy] Microwave Telemetry Inc, Columbia, MD USA; [Brooks, Edward J.] Cape Eleuthera Inst, Shark Res & Conservat Program, Eleuthera, Bahamas; [Fernando, Daniel] Manta Trust, Catemwood House, Corscombe, Dorchester, England; [Fernando, Daniel] Linnaeus Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Lund, Sweden; [Fernando, Daniel] Blue Resources, Colombo, Sri Lanka; [Hazin, Fabio H.

Despite their environmental relevance, the mechanisms by which they can bore have remained elusive and paradoxical, in that, as oxygenic phototrophs, cyanobacteria tend to alkalinize their surroundings, which will encourage carbonate precipitation, not dissolution. Therefore, cyanobacteria must rely on unique adaptations to bore. Studies with the filamentous euendolith, Mastigocoleus testarum, indicated that excavation requires both cellular energy and transcellular calcium transport, mediated by P-type ATPases, but the cellular basis for this phenomenon remains obscure. We present evidence that excavation in M. testarum involves two unique cellular adaptations. Long-range calcium transport is based on active pumping at multiple cells along boring filaments, orchestrated by the preferential localization of calcium ATPases at one cell pole, in a ring pattern, facing the cross-walls, and by repeating this placement and polarity, a pattern that breaks at branching and apical cells. In addition, M. testarum differentiates specialized cells we call calcicytes, that which accumulate calcium at concentrations more than 500-fold those found in other cyanobacteria, concomitantly and drastically lowering photosynthetic pigments and enduring severe cytoplasmatic alkalinization. Calcicytes occur commonly, but not exclusively, in apical parts of the filaments distal to the excavation front. We suggest that calcicytes allow for fast calcium flow at low, nontoxic concentrations through undifferentiated cells by providing buffering storage for excess calcium before final excretion to the outside medium.","[Guida, Brandon Scott; Garcia-Pichel, Ferran] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85257 USA",8,10.1073/pnas.1524687113,2016

Though widespread, the mechanisms that underlie faunal changes are poorly understood. In tropical marine systems, corals play a crucial role in forming habitat, but coral cover on many reefs is declining sharply. Coral degradation affects the olfactory cues that provide reliable information on the presence and intensity of threat. Here, we show for the first time that the ability of a habitat generalist to learn predators using an efficient and widespread method of predator learning is compromised in degraded coral habitats. Results indicate that chemical alarm cues are no longer indicative of a local threat for the habitat generalist (the damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis), and these cues can no longer be used to learn the identity of novel predators in degraded habitats. By contrast, a rubble specialist and congeneric (Pomacentrus coelestis) responded to olfactory threat cues regardless of background environment and could learn the identity of a novel predator using chemical alarm cues. Understanding how some species can cope with or acclimate to the detrimental impacts of habitat degradation on risk assessment abilities will be crucial to defining the scope of resilience in threatened communities.","[McCormick, Mark I.; Lonnstedt, Oona M.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [McCormick, Mark I.; Lonnstedt, Oona M.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Lonnstedt, Oona M.] Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Genet Limnol, Uppsala, Sweden",5,10.1098/rspb.2016.0441,2016

Estimates of fish biomass, their spatial distribution, and recovery potential are important for evaluating reef status and crucial for setting management targets. Here we modeled fish biomass estimates across all reefs of the western Indian Ocean using key variables that predicted the empirical data collected from 337 sites. These variables were used to create biomass and recovery time maps to prioritize spatially explicit conservation actions. The resultant fish biomass map showed high variability ranging from similar to 15 to 2900 kg/ha, primarily driven by human populations, distance to markets, and fisheries management restrictions. Lastly, we assembled data based on the age of fisheries closures and showed that biomass takes similar to 25 years to recover to typical equilibrium values of similar to 1200 kg/ha. The recovery times to biomass levels for sustainable fishing yields, maximum diversity, and ecosystem stability or conservation targets once fishing is suspended was modeled to estimate temporal costs of restrictions. The mean time to recovery for the whole region to the conservation target was 8.1(+/-3SD) years, while recovery to sustainable fishing thresholds was between 0.5 and 4 years, but with high spatial variation. Recovery prioritization scenario models included one where local governance prioritized recovery of degraded reefs and two that prioritized minimizing recovery time, where countries either operated independently or collaborated. The regional collaboration scenario selected remote areas for conservation with uneven national responsibilities and spatial coverage, which could undermine collaboration. There is the potential to achieve sustainable fisheries within a decade by promoting these pathways according to their social-ecological suitability.","[McClanahan, Timothy R.; Maina, Joseph M.] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Marine Programs, Coral Reef Conservat Project, Mombasa, Kenya; [Maina, Joseph M.; Jones, Kendall R.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat Sci, Australian Res Council,Ctr Excellence Environm De, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Maina, Joseph M.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Environm Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; [Graham, Nicholas A.

Typically, representing and replicating the habitat types present within protected areas is used to spread the risk of protecting frequently disturbed sites. This was the approach used during the 2004 re-zoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) via the Representative Areas Program. Over 10 years later, we examine whether the risk was spread by mapping exposure of coral reefs in the GBRMP to four disturbances that cause coral mortality: bleaching, tropical cyclones, crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, and freshwater inundation. Our objectives were to: (1) assess whether no-take areas include a range of disturbance regimes, and (2) identify coral reef areas with lower relative exposure. At least 13% and an average of 31% of reef locations in each of 11 exposure classes are included within no-take areas. A greater proportion of low-exposure areas are within no-take areas than high-exposure areas (34.2% vs. 28.3%). The results demonstrate the value of risk spreading when exposure data are not available while also showing that regularly assessing exposure increases capacity for adaptive, resilience-based reef management.","[Maynard, Jeffrey A.] Marine Appl Res Ctr, Wilmington, NC 28411 USA; [Maynard, Jeffrey A.; Planes, Serge] CRIOBE, EPHE, CNRS, Lab Excellence,CORAIL,USR 3278, Moorea, Fr Polynesia; [Beeden, Roger; Dryden, Jen; Wachenfeld, David] Great Barrier Reef Marine Pk Author, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Beeden, Roger; Johnson, Johanna E.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4814, Australia; [Beeden, Roger; Johnson, Johanna E.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Cairns, Qld 4870, Australia; [Puotinen, Marjetta] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Johnson, Johanna E.; Devlin, Michelle] C2O Consulting, Coasts Climate Oceans, Cairns, Qld 4870, Australia; [Marshall, Paul] Reef Ecol, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Marshall, Paul] Univ Queensland, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat Res, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [van Hooidonk, Ruben] NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, 4301 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [van Hooidonk, Ruben] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Heron, Scott F.] NOAA Coral Reef Watch, NESDIS Ctr Satellite Applicat & Res, 5830 Univ Res Ct,E-RA3, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Heron, Scott F.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Dept Phys, Marine Geophys Lab, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Lawrey, Eric] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Ban, Natalie] Univ Victoria, Sch Environm Studies, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada",5,10.1111/conl.12198,2016

Here, we use seascape genetic analysis of a diversity metric, allelic richness (AR), for 47 reef species sampled across 13 Hawaiian Islands to empirically demonstrate that large reefs high in coral cover harbour the greatest genetic diversity on average. We found that a species's life history (e.g. depth range and herbivory) mediates response of genetic diversity to seascape drivers in logical ways. Furthermore, a metric of combined multi-species AR showed strong coupling to species richness and habitat area, quality and stability that few species showed individually. We hypothesize that macro-ecological forces and species interactions, by mediating species turnover and occupancy (and thus a site's mean effective population size), influence the aggregate genetic diversity of a site, potentially allowing it to behave as an apparent emergent trait that is shaped by the dominant seascape drivers. The results highlight inherent feedbacks between ecology and genetics, raise concern that genetic resilience of entire reef communities is compromised by factors that reduce coral cover or available habitat, including thermal stress, and provide a foundation for new strategies for monitoring and preserving biodiversity of entire reef ecosystems.","[Selkoe, Kimberly A.; Toonen, Robert J.] Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; [Selkoe, Kimberly A.] Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, 735 State St, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA; [Gaggiotti, Oscar E.] Univ St Andrews, Scottish Oceans Inst, Sch Biol, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland; [Treml, Eric A.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Biosci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Wren, Johanna L.

They are also particularly sensitive to changing energetic requirements by different trophic levels. Microbialization specifically refers to the increase in the energetic metabolic demands of microbes relative to macrobes and is significantly correlated with increasing human influence on coral reefs. In this study, metabolic theory of ecology is used to quantify the relative contributions of two broad bacterioplankton groups, autotrophs and heterotrophs, to energy flux on 27 Pacific coral reef ecosystems experiencing human impact to varying degrees. The effective activation energy required for photosynthesis is lower than the average energy of activation for the biochemical reactions of the Krebs cycle, and changes in the proportional abundance of these two groups can greatly affect rates of energy and materials cycling. We show that reef-water communities with a higher proportional abundance of microbial autotrophs expend more metabolic energy per gram of microbial biomass. Increased energy and materials flux through fast energy channels (i.e. water-column associated microbial autotrophs) may dampen the detrimental effects of increased heterotrophic loads (e.g. coral disease) on coral reef systems experiencing anthropogenic disturbance.","[Somera, Tracey McDole; Barott, Katie; Grasis, Juris; Hatay, Mark; Hilton, Brett J.; Hisakawa, Nao; Nosrat, Bahador; Silveira, Cynthia B.; Rohwer, Forest] San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Bailey, Barbara; Nulton, James] San Diego State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Brainard, Russell E.] NOAA Fisheries, Pacific Islands Fisheries Sci Ctr, 1125 B Ala Moana Blvd, Honolulu, HI 96814 USA; [Sullivan, Chris] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, 9500 Gillman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",3,10.1098/rspb.2016.0467,2016

This is because particular traits may be favoured by a changing environment, or by habitat degradation. Furthermore, other traits can be selected against because degradation can relax the association between fishes and benthic habitat. We characterised six important ecological traits for fish species occurring at seven sites across a disturbed coral reef archipelago in Indonesia, where reefs have been exposed to eutrophication and destructive fishing practices for decades. Functional diversity was assessed using two complementary indices (FRic and RaoQ) and correlated to important environmental factors (live coral cover and rugosity, representing local reef health, and distance from shore, representing a cross-shelf environmental gradient). Indices were examined for both a change in their mean, as well as temporal (short-term; hours) and spatial (cross-shelf) variability, to assess whether fish-habitat association became relaxed along with habitat degradation. Furthermore, variability in individual traits was examined to identify the traits that are most affected by habitat change. Increases in the general reef health indicators, live coral cover and rugosity (correlated with distance from the mainland), were associated with decreases in the variability of functional diversity and with community-level changes in the abundance of several traits (notably home range size, maximum length, microalgae, detritus and small invertebrate feeding and reproductive turnover). A decrease in coral cover increased variability of RaoQ while rugosity and distance both inversely affected variability of FRic; however, averages for these indices did not reveal patterns associated with the environment. These results suggest that increased degradation of coral reefs is associated with increased variability in fish community functional composition resulting from selective impacts on specific traits, thereby affecting the functional response of these communities to increasing perturbations.","[Plass-Johnson, Jeremiah G.; Teichberg, Mirta C.; Ferse, Sebastian C.

The prevalence of ciguatera toxins in fish has been linked to the presence and distribution of toxin-producing species in coral reef ecosystems, which is largely determined by the presence of suitable benthic habitat and environmental conditions favorable for growth. Here using single factor experiments, we examined the effects of salinity, irradiance, and temperature on growth of 17 strains of Gambierdiscus representing eight species/phylotypes (G. belizeanus, G. caribaeus, G. carolinianus, G. carpenteri, G. pacificus, G. silvae, Gambierdiscus sp. type 4-5), most of which were established from either Marakei Island, Republic of Kiribati, or St. Thomas, United States Virgin Island (USVI). Comparable to prior studies, growth rates fell within the range of 0-0.48 divisions day(-1). In the salinity and temperature studies, Gambierdiscus responded in a near Gaussian, non-linear manner typical for such studies, with optimal and suboptimal growth occurring in the range of salinities of 25 and 45 and 21.0 and 32.5 degrees C. In the irradiance experiment, no mortality was observed; however, growth rates at 55 mu mol photons . m(-2) . s(-1) were lower than those at 110-400 mu mol photons . m(-2). s(-1). At the extremes of the environmental conditions tested, growth rates were highly variable, evidenced by large coefficients of variability.

Foraging excursions of A. vaigiensis were compared between predator-rich marine reserves and predator-depauperate fished reefs during summer and winter (similar to 18 and 22 degrees C water, respectively). A. vaigiensis foraged with shorter excursions in marine reserves than fished reefs and higher excursions during summer than winter. Effects of predation risk and water temperature on A. vaigiensis foraging were isolated in an aquarium experiment. Groups were held at 18 or 22 degrees C and visually exposed to a temperate predator, a predator control (temperate herbivore) and an empty tank. Foraging excursions and feeding rates were reduced when exposed to predators at 22 degrees C, but did not differ between predator and the predator control or empty tank at 18 degrees C. Results suggest temperate predators may restrict range expansions of A. vaigiensis by reducing its' food intake during summer months. But winter water temperatures may limit feeding, independent of predation risk. Protection of predators from fishing should improve resistance of some marine ecosystems to impacts of range expanding prey.","[Beck, Hayden J.; Feary, David A.; Fowler, Ashley M.; Booth, David J.] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Life Sci, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Madin, Elizabeth M.

In total, prey taxa categorized as oceanic in origin contributed 10-76 % of total zooplankton biomass in fish guts. The summed contribution of oceanic prey taxa to fish diet was significantly higher than expected under a model of random feeding based on the availability of oceanic versus reef-associated prey as sampled by zooplankton net tows.

Thus, this species has the potential to drive dramatic changes in coral reef ecosystems; yet, very little basic demographic information exists for C. maximum; nor do we know factors that potentially contribute to variation in vital rates. This study estimated individual growth (change in shell aperture diameter) and survival of focal (tagged) vermetids (n = 297) over 646 days, to test hypotheses that growth and/or survival rates were size-dependent, density-dependent, and/or habitat-dependent. This study was conducted on 80 haphazardly selected patch reefs, split evenly among eight discrete sites. The design also incorporated an experimental density reduction (e.g. on half the study reefs at each site divers reduced the densities of vermetids). Vermetid growth rates decreased with body size, and the slope of this relationship was steeper for reefs with experimentally reduced densities. Vermetid growth decreased weakly with local biomass of vermetids (i.e. estimated biomass within a 20 cm radius of focal individuals) but did not vary with local substrate composition. Vermetid survival increased with body size and local biomass; the relationship with biomass was steeper for reefs where vermetid densities had been experimentally reduced. Survival was also greater on living coral Porites lobata (where coral growth covered longitudinal extensions of vermetid shells) relative to dead coral substrate (where vermetid shells extensions remained exposed). These data suggest little scope for regulation of vermetid population growth via direct density dependence in demographic rates. However, given that vermetids can kill corals, and vermetid survival probabilities appear to depend upon coral cover, it is predicted that vermetids may experience cyclical dynamics that are coupled to the dynamics of living coral.","[Shima, Jeffrey S.; Phillips, Nicole E.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Coastal Ecol Lab, Wellington, New Zealand; [Osenberg, Craig W.] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA",2,10.1007/s00227-016-2859-1,2016

For coral reefs there has been increasing interest in recent decades in the use of ecosystem models for evaluating the effects of fishing and the efficacy of marine protected areas. However, ecosystem models that integrate physical forcings, biogeochemical and ecological dynamics, and human induced perturbations are still underdeveloped. We applied an ecosystem model (Atlantis) to the coral reef ecosystem of Guam using a suite of management scenarios prioritized in consultation with local resource managers to review the effects of each scenario on performance measures related to the ecosystem, the reef-fish fishery (e.g., fish landings) and coral habitat. Comparing tradeoffs across the selected scenarios showed that each scenario performed best for at least one of the selected performance indicators. The integrated 'full regulation' scenario outperformed other scenarios with four out of the six performance metrics at the cost of reef-fish landings. This model application quantifies the socio-ecological costs and benefits of alternative management scenarios. When the effects of climate change were taken into account, several scenarios performed equally well, but none prevented a collapse in coral biomass over the next few decades assuming a business-as-usual greenhouse gas emissions scenario.","[Weijerman, Mariska] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Joint Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Weijerman, Mariska] Wageningen Univ, Environm Syst Anal Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Weijerman, Mariska; Brainard, Russell E.] NOAA, Coral Reef Ecosystem Program, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Honolulu, HI USA; [Fulton, Elizabeth A.] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Fulton, Elizabeth A.] Univ Tasmania, Ctr Marine Socioecol, Hobart, Tas, Australia",11,10.1371/journal.pone.0152577,2016

Yet with limited funds for conservation of threatened species and ecosystems there is a desire to identify priority areas where investment efficiently conserves multiple ecosystem services. We mapped four mangrove ecosystems services (coastal protection, fisheries, biodiversity, and carbon storage) across Fiji. Using a cost-effectiveness analysis, we prioritised mangrove areas for each service, where the effectiveness was a function of the benefits provided to the local communities, and the costs were associated with restricting specific uses of mangroves. We demonstrate that, although priority mangrove areas (top 20%) for each service can be managed at relatively low opportunity costs (ranging from 4.5 to 11.3% of overall opportunity costs), prioritising for a single service yields relatively low co-benefits due to limited geographical overlap with priority areas for other services. None-the-less, prioritisation of mangrove areas provides greater overlap of benefits than if sites were selected randomly for most ecosystem services. We discuss deficiencies in the mapping of ecosystems services in data poor regions and how this may impact upon the equity of managing mangroves for particular services across the urban-rural divide in developing countries. Finally we discuss how our maps may aid decision-makers to direct funding for mangrove management from various sources to localities that best meet funding objectives, as well as how this knowledge can aid in creating a national mangrove zoning scheme.","[Atkinson, Scott C.; Adams, Vanessa M.; Possingham, Hugh P.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat Sci, ARC Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Jupiter, Stacy D.] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Melanesia Program, Suva, Fiji; [Ingram, J.

This study compared the relative and interacting effects of competition and predation on two competing species of coral reef fish, Pomacentrus amboinensis and P. moluccensis (Pomacentridae), using a multifactorial experiment. Fish were subjected to the sight and smell of a known predator (Pseudochromis fuscus), the presence of the heterospecific competitor (i.e., P. amboinensis vs. P. moluccensis), or a combination of the two for a period of 19 days. The sub-lethal effects of predator/competitor treatments were compared with controls; a combination of otolith microstructure analysis and observations were used to determine otolith growth patterns and behaviour. We predicted that the stress of competition and/or predation would result in strong sub-lethal impacts, and act synergistically on growth and behavioural patterns. We found strong evidence to support this prediction, but only for P. amboinensis, which suffered reductions in growth in both predator and competitor treatments, with the largest reductions occurring when subjected to both predation and competition concurrently. There was strong evidence of asymmetrical competition between the two damselfish species, with P. moluccensis as the dominant competitor, displaying strong aggressive behaviour towards P. amboinensis. Growth reductions for P. amboinensis in predator/competitor treatments appeared to come about primarily due to increases in shelter seeking behaviour, which significantly reduced the foraging rates of individuals compared with controls. These data highlight the importance of predator/competitor synergisms in influencing key behaviours and demographic parameters for juvenile coral reef fishes.","[Hall, April] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",1,10.1371/journal.pone.0151778,2016

Complex spatial policies allow managers to better reflect underlying ecological and economic heterogeneity, but incur higher compliance and enforcement costs. To choose the most appropriate management resolution, we need to characterize the relationship between management resolution and performance. We parameterize a model of the commercial coral trout fishery in the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, which is currently managed by a single, spatially homogeneous management policy. We use this model to estimate how the spatial resolution of management policies affect the amount of revenue generated, and assess whether a more spatially complex policy can be justified. Our results suggest that economic variation is likely to be a more important source of heterogeneity than ecological differences, and that the majority of this variation can be captured by a relatively simple spatial management policy. Moreover, while an increase in policy resolution can improve performance, the location of policy changes also needs to align with ecological and socioeconomic variation. Interestingly, the highly complex process of larval dispersal, which plays a critical ecological role in coral reef ecosystem dynamics, may not demand equally complex management policies.","[Bode, Michael] Univ Melbourne, Sch Biosci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Bode, Michael] Univ Melbourne, ARC Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Sanchirico, James N.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Armsworth, Paul R.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN USA; [Armsworth, Paul R.] Univ Tennessee, NIMBioS, Knoxville, TN USA",7,10.1098/rspb.2015.2828,2016

In this study, I used the zebrafish for (lots of rods) mutant, characterized by a diminished UV cone population compared to that of wild-type zebrafish, to test whether its foraging performance differed from that of the wild-type (control). The mean location distance and angle (variables that are reliable indicators of foraging performance) at which control fish detected zooplankton prey were, on average, 24 and 90% greater than corresponding measures for for fish. Such inferior foraging performance of the mutant could be explained by reduced contrast perception of the prey, resulting from the diminished population of UV cones and associated sensitivity. Thus, UV cones enhance the foraging performance of zebrafish, a crucial ecological function that may explain why small zooplanktivorous fishes retain UV cones throughout their lives.","[Flamarique, Inigo Novales] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Flamarique, Inigo Novales] Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Stn CSC, POB 1700, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada",8,10.1098/rspb.2016.0058,2016

Recent research revealed that high availability of labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC) negatively affects scleractinian corals. Studies on the interplay of these factors, however, are lacking, but urgently needed to understand coral reef functioning under present and near future conditions. This experimental study investigated the individual and combined effects of ambient and high DIC (pCO(2) 403 mu atm/pH(Total) 8.2 and 996 mu atm/pH(Total) 7.8) and DOC (added as Glucose 0 and 294 mu mol L-1, background DOC concentration of 83 mu mol L-1) availability on the physiology (net and gross photosynthesis, respiration, dark and light calcification, and growth) of the scleractinian coral Acropora millepora (Ehrenberg, 1834) from the Great Barrier Reef over a 16 day interval. High DIC availability did not affect photosynthesis, respiration and light calcification, but significantly reduced dark calcification and growth by 50 and 23%, respectively. High DOC availability reduced net and gross photosynthesis by 51% and 39%, respectively, but did not affect respiration. DOC addition did not influence calcification, but significantly increased growth by 42%. Combination of high DIC and high DOC availability did not affect photosynthesis, light calcification, respiration or growth, but significantly decreased dark calcification when compared to both controls and DIC treatments. On the ecosystem level, high DIC concentrations may lead to reduced accretion and growth of reefs dominated by Acropora that under elevated DOC concentrations will likely exhibit reduced primary production rates, ultimately leading to loss of hard substrate and reef erosion. It is therefore important to consider the potential impacts of elevated DOC and DIC simultaneously to assess real world scenarios, as multiple rather than single factors influence key physiological processes in coral reefs.","[Meyer, Friedrich W.; Kunzmann, Andreas; Wild, Christian] Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Ecol ZMT, Dept Ecol, Bremen, Germany; [Meyer, Friedrich W.; Vogel, Nikolas; Wild, Christian] Univ Bremen, Fac Biol & Chem, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Vogel, Nikolas; Uthicke, Sven] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Diele, Karen] Edinburgh Napier Univ, Sch Life Sport & Social Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Diele, Karen] St Abbs Marine Stn, St Abbs, Scotland",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0149598,2016

Knowing how these factors impact the future fate of reefs requires delineating stress responses across ecological, organismal and cellular scales. Recent advances in coral reef biology have integrated molecular processes with ecological fitness and have identified putative suites of temperature acclimation genes in a Scleractinian coral Acropora hyacinthus. We wondered what unique characteristics of these genes determined their coordinate expression in response to temperature acclimation, and whether or not other corals and cnidarians would likewise possess these features. Here, we focus on cytosine methylation as an epigenetic DNA modification that is responsive to environmental stressors. We identify common conserved patterns of cytosine-guanosine dinucleotide (CpG) motif frequencies in upstream promoter domains of different functional gene groups in two cnidarian genomes: a coral (Acropora digitifera) and an anemone (Nematostella vectensis). Our analyses show that CpG motif frequencies are prominent in the promoter domains of functional genes associated with environmental adaptation, particularly those identified in A. hyacinthus. Densities of CpG sites in upstream promoter domains near the transcriptional start site (TSS) are 1.38x higher than genomic background levels upstream of -2000 bp from the TSS. The increase in CpG usage suggests selection to allow for DNA methylation events to occur more frequently within 1 kb of the TSS. In addition, observed shifts in CpG densities among functional groups of genes suggests a potential role for epigenetic DNA methylation within promoter domains to impact functional gene expression responses in A. digitifera and N. vectensis. Identifying promoter epigenetic sequence motifs among genes within specific functional groups establishes an approach to describe integrated cellular responses to environmental stress in reef corals and potential roles of epigenetics on survival and fitness in the face of global climate change.","[Marsh, Adam G.; Hoadley, Kenneth D.; Warner, Mark E.] Univ Delaware, Sch Marine Sci & Policy, Marine Biosci, Lewes, DE 19958 USA; [Marsh, Adam G.] Univ Delaware, Ctr Bioinformat & Computat Biol, Delaware Biotechnol Inst, Newark, DE USA",4,10.1371/journal.pone.0150840,2016

The angle of incidence of the incoming flow controls the nature of the wake on both sides and ends of the island, which changes from cyclonic to anticylonic wake flow, with either attached or shed eddies. Using an off-line bio-physical model, we simulated the dispersal and recruitment of an abundant Caribbean coral reef fish, the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum) in the context of the wake flow variability around St. Croix.

Additionally, we evaluated the effects of contact with this invader on two native corals, Siderastrea stellata and Montastraea cavernosa, using a manipulative experiment. Multivariate analyses detected significant differences between coral assemblages in invaded and non-invaded zones. In the invaded zone, we observed greater cover of T. tagusensis on reef walls (34.9 +/- 4.2 %) than on reef tops (18.5 +/- 4.1 %). Madracis decactis and Mussismilia hispida were significantly less abundant in invaded zone than in non-invaded zones at the reef walls.

Sedimentary microphytobenthos exhibited the strongest response to seasonality with 5.7 times higher P-n in spring than in winter. R was highest in hard corals among all groups in every season, likely due to nighttime calcification and heterotrophic activity. Gross photosynthesis-to-respiration ratios (P-g:R) were highest for turf algae and macroalgae as well as cyanobacterial mats. While R was primarily positively related to PAR and temperature and P-g:R to inorganic nutrients, few groups revealed significant relations between P-n and environmental parameters. Seasonal budgets found daily gross primary production and respiration to be dominated by hard and soft corals. Total reef gross primary production was comparable between less oligotrophic spring and more oligotrophic summer. This indicates that processes such as heterotrophic feeding and microbial dinitrogen fixation may help the functional groups overcome potential nutrient limitation of primary production in summer.","[van Hoytema, Nanne; Bednarz, Vanessa N.; Cardini, Ulisse; Naumann, Malik S.; Wild, Christian] Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Ecol ZMT, Coral Reef Ecol Grp CORE, Fahrenheitstr 6, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Al-Horani, Fuad A.] Univ Jordan, Aqaba & Marine Sci Stn MSS, Aqaba 77110, Jordan; [Wild, Christian] Univ Bremen, Fac Biol & Chem, NW 2 Leobener Str, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",7,10.1007/s00227-015-2787-5,2016

Plakortis angulospiculatus, a common sponge species that spans the depth gradient from shallow to mesophotic reefs in the Caribbean, regenerates faster following predation and invests more energy in protein synthesis at mesophotic depths compared to shallow reef conspecifics. However, since P. angulospiculatus from mesophotic reefs typically contain lower concentrations of chemical feeding deterrents, they are not able to defend new tissue from predation as efficiently as conspecifics from shallow reefs. Nonetheless, following exposure to predators on shallow reefs, transplanted P. angulospiculatus from mesophotic depths developed chemical deterrence to predatory fishes. A survey of bioactive extracts indicated that a specific defensive metabolite, plakortide F, varied in concentration with depth, producing altered deterrence between shallow and mesophotic reef P. angulospiculatus. Different selective pressures in shallow and mesophotic habitats have resulted in phenotypic plasticity within this sponge species that is manifested in variable chemical defense and tissue regeneration at wound sites.","[Slattery, Marc; Gochfeld, Deborah J.] Univ Mississippi, Dept BioMol Sci, University, MS 38677 USA; [Slattery, Marc; Gochfeld, Deborah J.] Univ Mississippi, Natl Ctr Nat Prod Res, University, MS 38677 USA; [Diaz, M.

Here we use a biophysical model of larval dispersal to estimate vertical connectivity of a broadcasting (Orbicella faveolata) and a brooding (Porites astreoides) species of coral in the US Virgin Islands. Modeling predicts subsidy to shallow areas by mesophotic larvae of both species based on local hydrology, adult reproductive characteristics, larval traits, and a wide range of scenarios developed to test depth-sensitive factors, such as fertilization rates and post-settlement survivorship. In extreme model scenarios of reduced fertilization and post-settlement survivorship of mesophotic larvae, 1-10 % local mesophotic subsidy to shallow recruitment is predicted for both species, which are demographically significant. Although direct vertical connectivity is higher for the broadcaster, the brooder demonstrates higher local multigenerational vertical connectivity, which suggests that local P. astreoides populations are more resilient than those of O. faveolata, and corroborates field studies. As shallow habitat degrades, mesophotic-shallow subsidy is predicted to increase for both species. This study is the first of its kind to simulate larval dispersal and settlement between habitats of different depths, and these findings have local, regional, and global implications for predicting and managing coral reef persistence in a changing climate.","[Holstein, Daniel M.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Marine Biol & Fisheries, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Holstein, Daniel M.; Smith, Tyler B.] Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, St Thomas, VI 00802 USA; [Paris, Claire B.; Vaz, Ana C.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Dept Ocean Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA",24,10.1007/s00338-015-1339-2,2016

Planktivores dominated fish assemblages, particularly in the upper mesophotic zone, possibly due to a greater availability of zooplankton coming from the colder Equatorial Undercurrent in mesophotic depths of the SPSPA. Turf algae, fleshy macroalgae and scleractinian corals dominated benthic assemblages between 30 and 40 m depth, while bryozoans, black corals and sponges dominated between 40 and 90 m depth.

Most of the damage is concentrated in shallow waters (< 30 m deep) where humans can comfortably operate and where physical disturbances are most disruptive to marine organisms. Yet coral reefs can extend to depths exceeding 100 m, potentially offering refuge from the threats facing shallower reefs. We deployed baited remote underwater stereo-video systems (stereo-BRUVs) at depths of 10-90 m around the southern Mariana Islands to investigate whether fish species targeted by fishing in the shallows may be accruing benefits from being at depth. We show that biomass, abundance and species richness of fishery-targeted species increased from shallow reef areas to a depth of 60 m, whereas at greater depths, a lack of live coral habitat corresponded to lower numbers of fish. The majority of targeted species were found to have distributions that ranged from shallow depths (10 m) to depths of at least 70 m, emphasising that habitat, not depth, is the limiting factor in their vertical distribution. While the gradient of abundance and biomass versus depth was steepest for predatory species, the first species usually targeted by fishing, we also found that fishery-targeted herbivores prevailed in similar biomass and species richness to 60 m. Compared to shallow marine protected areas, there was clearly greater biomass of fishery-targeted species accrued in mesophotic depths. Particularly some species typically harvested by depth-limited fishing methods (e.g., spearfishing), such as the endangered humphead wrasse Cheilinus undulatus, were found in greater abundance on deeper reefs. We conclude that mesophotic depths provide essential fish habitat and refuge for fishery-targeted species, representing crucial zones for fishery management and research into the resilience of disturbed coral reef ecosystems.","[Lindfield, Steven J.] Univ Western Australia, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, UWA Oceans Inst & Sch Plant Biol, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Lindfield, Steven J.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Harvey, Euan S.; McIlwain, Jennifer L.] Curtin Univ Technol, Dept Environm & Agr, Bentley, WA 6102, Australia; [Lindfield, Steven J.; Halford, Andrew R.] Dept Pk & Wildlife, Perth, WA 6151, Australia; [Lindfield, Steven J.] Palau Int Coral Reef Ctr, POB 7086, Koror 96940, Palau",30,10.1007/s00338-015-1386-8,2016

This study represents the first underwater visual census of reef fish communities in the Greater Caribbean on MCEs at depths up to 80 m in Bermuda and 130 m in Cura double dagger ao. Sampling was performed using mixed-gas closed-circuit rebreathers. Quantitative data on reef fish communities were obtained for four habitats: coral reefs (45-80 m), rhodolith beds (45-80 m), ledges (85-130 m) and walls (85-130 m). A total of 38 species were recorded in Bermuda and 66 in Cura double dagger ao. Mesophotic reef fish communities varied significantly between the two localities. MCEs in Bermuda had lower richness and abundance, but higher biomass than those in Cura double dagger ao. Richness, abundance and biomass increased with depth in Bermuda, but decreased in Cura double dagger ao. A high turnover of species was found among depth strata and between Bermuda and other Caribbean upper MCEs (45-80 m), indicating that depth was an important driver of community structure at all localities. However, local and evolutionary factors (habitat and endemism) are likely the main factors shaping communities in isolated locations such as Bermuda. High fishing pressure is evident in both localities, as total biomass of apex predators was generally low, and thus may be driving a ""refugia"" scenario in Bermuda, as the abundance and biomass of macro-carnivores increased with depth and distance from the coast.","[Pinheiro, H.

Rapid relative sea-level rise of 0.6 m over a relatively pristine coral reef in Solomon Islands, caused by a subduction earthquake in April 2007, generated a unique opportunity to examine in situ coral reef response to relative sea-level rise of the magnitude (but not the rate) anticipated by 2100. Extent of live coral was measured from satellite imagery in 2003, 2006, 2009 and 2012. Ecological data were obtained from microatolls and ecological surveys in May 2013. The reef was sampled at 12 locations where dense live hard coral remained absent, remained present or changed from absent to present following subsidence. Ecological data (substratum depth, live coral canopy depth, coral canopy height, substratum suitability, recruitment, diversity and Acropora presence) were measured at each location to identify factors associated with coral response to relative sea-level rise. Vertical and horizontal proliferation of coral occurred following subsidence. Lateral expansion of live coral, accomplished primarily by branching Acropora spp., resulted in lower diversity in regions which changed composition from pavement to dense live coral following subsidence. Of the ecological factors measured, biotic factors were more influential than abiotic factors; species identity was the most important factor in determining which regions of the reef responded to rapid sea-level rise. On relatively pristine reef flats under present climatic conditions, rapid relative sea-level rise generated an opportunity for hard coral to proliferate. However, the species assemblage of the existing reef was important in determining response to sea-level change, by providing previously bare substrate with a source of new coral colonies. Degraded reefs with altered species composition and slower coral growth rates may be less able to respond to climate change-induced sea-level changes.","[Saunders, Megan I.; Leon, Javier X.; Phinn, Stuart R.; Mumby, Peter J.] Univ Queensland, Global Change Inst, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Saunders, Megan I.; Mumby, Peter J.] Univ Queensland, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Saunders, Megan I.; Mumby, Peter J.] Univ Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Reef Studies, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Albert, Simon] Univ Queensland, Sch Civil Engn, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Roelfsema, Chris M.; Leon, Javier X.] Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Leon, Javier X.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Sci & Engn, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia; [Woodroffe, Colin D.] Univ Wollongong, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",8,10.1007/s00338-015-1365-0,2016

To test whether coral cores could be used to identify bleaching events retrospectively, three sites in Tobago with pre-existing reef data including water quality and bleaching observations were identified. Colpophyllia natans cores were examined for growth anomalies which occurred during periods of thermal stress. If present, anomalies were compared to in situ, real-time bleaching observations and water quality data. Interestingly, sites with better water quality during the 2005 thermal anomaly were less prone to bleaching.

We present the first study of faunal biodiversity associated with the massive demosponge Spongosorites coralliophaga (Stephens, 1915) that typically colonizes coral debris fields of CWRs. Our study focused on the sessile fauna inhabiting sponges mixed with coral rubble at two contrasting settings in the northeast Atlantic: the shallow inshore (120-190 m water depth) Mingulay Reef Complex (MRC) and the deep offshore (500-1200 m) Logachev Mound (LM) coral province. MRC is dominated by the scleractinian Lophelia pertusa, while LM is dominated by L. pertusa and Madrepora oculata. Nine sponge-coral rubble associations were collected from MRC and four from LM. Measurements of abundance, species richness, diversity, evenness, dry biomass, and composition of sessile fauna on sponge and coral rubble microhabitats were undertaken. Differences in community composition between the two regions were mainly a response to changes in fauna with depth. Fauna composition was also different between sponge and coral rubble within each region. Infauna constituted a minor component of the sponge-associated fauna in MRC but had a higher contribution in LM. Sponge and coral rubble sessile fauna in both regions was mainly composed of cnidarians and molluscs, similarly to some previous studies. Sponges' outer surfaces at MRC were colonized by a species-rich community with high abundance and biomass suggesting that S. coralliophaga at MRC acts as a settlement surface for various organisms but such a role is not the case at LM. This difference in the role of S. coralliophaga as a biological structure is probably related to differences in fauna composition with depth, bottom current speed, and the quantity/quality of food supplied to the benthos.","[Kazanidis, Georgios; Witte, Ursula F.

We tested the effects of grazing pressure and ambient water conditions along an established eutrophication gradient on the recruitment and successional development of benthic communities of the Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia, through caging experiments with settlement tiles. Within 1 month, benthic community composition of the closest reef to land, near the city of Makassar, was significantly different from other sites further offshore, driven primarily by differences in recruitment of invertebrates or turf algae. In contrast to other caging experiments, consumer exclusion had no effect after 3 months, suggesting that larger, mobile consumers had little effect on the benthic communities of these reefs at all sites. Despite conditions that usually favour macroalgal development, this group was rarely observed on recruitment tiles even after 4 months of consumer exclusion. Furthermore, tiles from both the caged and open treatments retained high proportions of open space indicating the possible role of small-sized or non-fish consumers that were not excluded from the experiment. These results indicate that, unlike many other studies, benthic consumers in the Spermonde Archipelago had little effect on the recruitment and early succession of the reef habitat and that unexamined biota such as mesograzers may be significant in degraded systems.","[Plass-Johnson, Jeremiah G.; Heiden, Jasmin P.; Teichberg, Mirta] Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Ecol, Algae & Seagrass Ecol Grp, Bremen, Germany; [Plass-Johnson, Jeremiah G.; Heiden, Jasmin P.] Univ Bremen, Fac Biol & Chem, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Heiden, Jasmin P.] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Sect Biogeosci, Dept EcoTrace, Bremerhaven, Germany; [Abu, Nur; Lukman, Muhammad] Hasanuddin Univ, Res & Dev Ctr Marine Coastal & Small Islands, Makassar, Indonesia",5,10.1007/s00338-015-1369-9,2016

The system permits a detailed study of localised competition with major implications for coral reefs with respect to human impacts including climate change. Using underwater video cameras, this study examined competition among 30 species of large reef fishes (from nine families) for access to shelter provided by 26 tabular structures, which may be the highest reported diversity of vertebrates competing for a single resource. Mean concentrations of fishes under tabular structures were also among the highest biomass recorded on reefs (4.71 kg m(-2)). A generated dominance hierarchy for the occupation of shelter appeared to be primarily driven by the size of fishes. In contrast to previous studies, fishes higher in the hierarchy tended to exhibit the lowest levels of aggression. However, size difference between fishes was found to be strongly negatively correlated with the proportion of aggressive interactions (R (2) = 0.971, P < 0.0001). The strong competition for the shade provided by these corals highlights concerns about future shifts in the structure of large reef fish communities as corals are lost. This is particularly concerning given the critical functional roles played by certain species of large reef fishes that utilise tabular structure for shelter and which occupy the lower ranks of the dominance hierarchy.","[Kerry, J.

Until now, investigation of reef shark predation has relied on artificial stimuli to facilitate feeding events, with few sightings of natural predation events. Here we document two different foraging modes of the grey reef shark, Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos (f. Carcharhinidae), recorded without the influence of baits or burley. The first mode saw an aggregation of sharks targeting a morning mass spawning event of marbled grouper (f. Serranidae). We observed 120 separate grouper spawns over a 104-min period. Detailed analysis of 52 spawns showed an average of five groupers and 2.7 sharks involved in each spawn, with sharks usually on site within 1.29 s of spawn initiation. The success rate of investigating sharks was relatively low (8.1 %), and conspecific competition, rather than cooperative behaviour, was repeatedly observed among sharks. The second foraging mode documented was the nocturnal predation of individual fishes in the same reef pass 2 weeks later. Here, 128 separate fish pursuits were observed, with fusiliers (f. Caesionidae) comprising 88 % of targeted individuals. Multiple sharks usually investigated each fish, with over 300 interaction events recorded. Over 100 bite attempts were observed, and again the rate of predation was low, with fish taken in only 5.3 % of investigations (16 % of attempted bites). Our findings show that grey reef sharks naturally prey on species across a range of trophic levels, employing foraging techniques optimised for prey species and circumstance. Although a high-order mesopredator, the low rates of predation success observed suggest that grey reef sharks may have limited direct impact on lower-trophic-order species; however, this remains to be verified.","[Robbins, W.

Growth parameters generated from a von Bertalanffy growth function fitted to size-at-age data, however, indicated that mortality rates for the three mesopredators were similar and that 32-55 % of fish survived each year. Consequently, interspecific differences in annual turnover rates among E. rivulatus (1.9 g m(-2) yr(-1)), Pa. clathrata (0.10 g m(-2) yr(-1)) and Ps. fuscus (0.07 g m(-2) yr(-1)) were an artefact of differences in local biomass estimates. The rapid turnover estimates for E. rivulatus suggest this species is an important conduit of energy within the isolated patch reef habitat where it is typically found, while Ps. fuscus and Pa. clathrata channel smaller amounts of energy from specific habitats in the Ningaloo lagoon. Apparent differences in habitat, diet and turnover rates of the three species examined provide an insight into the different roles these species play in coral reef food webs and suggest that life-history traits allow for variability in the local and spatial contribution of these species at Ningaloo Reef. Moreover, calculating turnover rates of a broader suite of fish species from a range of trophic groups will help better define the role of fishes in coral reef trophic dynamics.","[Thillainath, Emma C.; McIlwain, Jennifer L.] Curtin Univ, Dept Environm & Agr, POB 1987, Bentley, WA 6102, Australia; [Wilson, Shaun K.] Dept Pk & Wildlife, Marine Sci Program, Kensington, WA 6151, Australia; [Depczynski, Martial] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Inst, Australian Inst Marine Sci, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Wilson, Shaun K.; Depczynski, Martial] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",3,10.1007/s00338-015-1367-y,2016

Within US Virgin Islands (USVI) waters, Nassau grouper FSAs were overfished until their disappearance in the 1970s and 1980s. In the early 2000s, however, Nassau grouper were found gathering at Grammanik Bank, USVI, a mesophotic coral reef adjacent to one of the extinct aggregation sites, and regulatory protective measures were implemented to protect this fledgling FSA. The population genetic dynamics of this rapid FSA deterioration followed by protection-facilitated, incipient recovery are unknown. We addressed two objectives: (1) we explored which factors (i.e., local vs. external recruitment) might be key in shaping the USVI FSA recovery; and (2) we examined the consequences of severe past overfishing on this FSA's current genetic status. We genotyped individuals (15 microsatellites) from the USVI FSA comprising three successive spawning years (2008-2010), as well as individuals from a much larger, presumably less impacted, Nassau grouper FSA in the Cayman Islands, to assess their comparative population dynamics. No population structure was detected between the USVI and Cayman FSAs (F (ST) = -0.0004); however, a temporally waning, genetic bottleneck signal was detected in the USVI FSA. Parentage analysis failed to identify any parent-offspring matches between USVI FSA adults and nearby juveniles, and relatedness analysis showed low levels of genetic relatedness among USVI FSA individuals. Genetic diversity across USVI FSA temporal collections was relatively high, and no marked differences were found between the USVI and Cayman FSAs. These collective results suggest that external recruitment is an important driver of the USVI FSA recovery. Furthermore, despite an apparent genetic bottleneck, the genetic diversity of USVI Nassau grouper has not been severely compromised. Our findings also provide a baseline for future genetic monitoring of the nascent USVI aggregation.","[Bernard, A. M.; Shivji, M.

Long-term studies offer unique opportunities to understand how multiple and recurrent disturbances can influence coral reef resilience and long-term dynamics. While the long-term dynamics of coral assemblages have been extensively documented, the long-term dynamics of coral reef fish assemblages have received less attention. Here, we describe the changes in fish assemblages on Tiahura reef, Moorea, from 1979 to 2011. During this 33-yr period, Tiahura was exposed to multiple disturbances (crown-of-thorns seastar outbreaks and cyclones) that caused recurrent declines and recoveries of coral cover and changes in the dominant coral genera. These shifts in coral composition were associated with long-term cascading effects on fish assemblages. The composition and trophic structure of fish assemblages continuously shifted without returning to their initial composition, whereas fish species richness remained stable, albeit with a small increase over time. We detected nonlinear responses of fish density when corals were most degraded. When coral cover dropped below 10 % following a severe crown-of-thorns sea star outbreak, the density of most fish trophic groups sharply decreased. Our study shows that historical contingency may potentially be an important but largely underestimated factor explaining the contemporary structure of reef fish assemblages and suggests that temporal stability in their structure and function should not necessarily be the target of management strategies that aim at increasing or maintaining coral reef resilience.","[Lamy, T.; Galzin, R.; de Loma, T.

We used laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and otolith microstructure analysis (daily increments and settlement marks) to determine the length of time larval fish spend near a reef prior to settlement. The otoliths of Pomacentrus amboinensis collected from four neighbouring reefs in the southern Great Barrier Reef showed clear and consistent differences in their elemental signatures prior to and following settlement. Elevated Ba:Ca near settlement and post-settlement was found in fish from all four reefs. However, there was individual variation in elemental profiles, with an increased otolith Ba-to-Ca ratio (near-reef signature) at settlement in 33 % of fish, and up to 8 d prior to settlement in others. Increment widths, often used as a proxy for growth, decreased approaching the settlement mark for all fish, providing further evidence for a ""search phase"" in larvae. We demonstrated experimentally that otoliths of fish kept in reefal or inter-reefal waters had different elemental chemistry. There were differences in the elemental composition of water samples within the study area, but no consistent trends with distance from reefs. There was poor discrimination of multi-element signatures among fish from different reefs during their pre-settlement phases. However, discrimination improved in the settlement and post-settlement phases of otoliths, indicating that reef waters and perhaps stage of ontogeny affected otolith chemistry. This study demonstrated clear near-reef elemental signatures in fish around settlement. We suggest these differences are due to a combination of water chemistry and physiological influences (e.g., growth). Combining LA-ICP-MS with otolith microstructure analysis can provide high-resolution information on the early life history of reef fishes. Further, a near-reef ""search phase"" prior to settlement may be common in reef fishes.","[Sih, Tiffany L.; Kingsford, Michael J.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",2,10.1007/s00338-015-1376-x,2016

While seaweed farming provides vital income to millions of artisanal farmers, it can negatively impact shallow coral reef and seagrass habitats. However, seaweed farming may also potentially provide food subsidies for herbivorous reef fish such as the Siganidae, a valuable target family, resulting in increased catch. Comparisons of reef fish landings across the central Philippines revealed that the catch of siganids was positively correlated to farmed seaweed production whilst negatively correlated to total reef fish catch over the same period of time. We tested the generality of this pattern by analysing seaweed production, siganid catch, and reef fish catch for six major seaweed-producing countries in the tropics. We hypothesized that increased seaweed production would correspond with increased catch of siganids but not other reef fish species. Analysis of the global data showed a positive correlation between farmed seaweeds and siganids in Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines) but not Africa (Tanzania and Zanzibar), or the Western Pacific (Fiji). In Southeast Asia, siganid catch increased disproportionately faster with seaweed production than did reef fish catch. Low continuity, sporadic production and smaller volumes of seaweed farming may explain the differences.","[Hehre, E.

Recent work on sharks has shown that often only a portion of the adult population will undertake migrations, while the rest may be resident in an area for long periods. Defining the extent to which adult sharks use specific habitats and their migratory behaviour is essential for assessing their risk of exposure to threats such as fishing and habitat degradation. The present study used acoustic telemetry to examine residency patterns and migratory behaviour of adult bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) along the East coast of Australia. Fifty-six VR2W acoustic receivers were used to monitor the movements of 33 bull sharks in the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Both males and females were detected year-round, but their abundance and residency peaked between September and December across years (2012-2014). High individual variability in reef use patterns was apparent, with some individuals leaving the array for long periods, whereas others (36%) exhibited medium (0.20-0.40) or high residency (>0.50). A large portion of the population (51%) undertook migrations of up to 1,400 km to other coral reefs and/or inshore coastal habitats in Queensland and New South Wales. Most of these individuals (76%) were mature females, and the timing of migrations coincided with the austral summer (Dec-Feb). All migrating individuals (except one) returned to the central GBR, highlighting its importance as a potential foraging ground. Our findings suggest that adult bull sharks appear to be highly dependent on coral reef resources and provide evidence of partial migration, where only a portion of the female population undertook seasonal migrations potentially to give birth. Given that estuarine habitats face constant anthropogenic pressures, understanding partial migration and habitat connectivity of large coastal predators should be a priority for their management.","[Espinoza, Mario; Heupel, Michelle R.; Tobin, Andrew J.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Espinoza, Mario; Heupel, Michelle R.; Tobin, Andrew J.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Espinoza, Mario] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Australian Inst Marine Sci, AIMS JCU, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Heupel, Michelle R.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, PMB 3, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia",19,10.1371/journal.pone.0147608,2016

We used 25 years of fishery-independent trap data (N = 11,237 trap hauls) to examine the spatial and temporal variability in temperate reef fish abundance along the southeast coast of the USA, a relatively understudied region with many economically important reef fish species. Overall, 441,298 individuals from 118 species were caught in the trap survey. Number of species and total number of individuals caught in the trap survey declined over the 25 years, but when separated, nontargeted fish species declined more than fishery-targeted species. For instance, traps caught a median of 18 nontargeted individuals and a median of 2-3 nontargeted reef fish species in the early 1990s, but by the 2010s, traps caught a median of fewer than three nontargeted individuals and a median of one nontarget species. Using generalized additive models, we found that the catch of fishery-targeted and nontargeted species was positively related to bottom water temperature, while depth influenced nontargeted and fishery-targeted species in opposite ways. The substantial and consistent decline in nontargeted fish species suggests that more research and management attention should be given to these often ignored species. These results suggest that the temperate reef fish community in the southeast USA is influenced by more than just fishing, perhaps including invasive species (e.g., lionfish Pterois volitans), decadal-scale environmental variability, or climate change.","[Bacheler, Nathan M.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, SE Fisheries Ctr, 101 Pivers Isl Rd, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA; [Smart, Tracey I.] Marine Resources Res Inst, South Carolina Dept Nat Resources, 217 Ft Johnson Rd, Charleston, SC 29412 USA",4,10.1007/s00227-015-2774-x,2016

Seabirds concentrate marine-derived nutrients on breeding islands in the form of feces (guano), and these nutrients dramatically alter terrestrial ecosystem ecology. Recent work in the remote Pacific indicates seabird-derived nutrients may also subsidize nearshore coral reefs, but the consequences of guano on complex, anthropogenically modified coral reefs are unknown. The impact of seabird guano on nearshore coral reefs around Moku Nui, an islet with a large seabird colony in Oahu, Hawaii, was investigated in comparison with coral reefs around three islets with lower seabird abundance. Reefs in close proximity to Moku Nui (where thousands of wedge-tailed shearwaters, Puffinus pacificus, breed) had greater concentrations of dissolved phosphate in seawater and greater delta N-15 in adjacent subtidal macroalgae relative to reefs next to smaller breeding colonies. However, dissolved nitrate was not different among islets. These results indicate that seabirds may be a source of nutrients for the waters surrounding Moku Nui that are already inundated with local and global stressors.","[Honig, Susanna E.; Mahoney, Brenna] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Honig, Susanna E.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Mol Cell & Dev Biol Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",2,10.1007/s00227-015-2808-4,2016

In addition, intraspecific modifications of the mating system in relation to environmental conditions have been recognized. Thirteen months of observation of mating units in a natural population of Rhinecanthus aculeatus from Okinawa Island, Japan, revealed that the mating system in this species involved a mixture of polygyny, monogamy, and potential promiscuity in solitary females. Females defended individual, multi-purpose territories, while males engaged in female defence (""female defence polygyny"") using displays and overt aggressions that advertised that territories were occupied. Male size was strongly linked to access to multiple females (i.e. polygyny). Plasticity in the mating system was related to male male competition and the ability of females to reject males. An increase in the proportion of monogamous pair territories over the course of the reproductive season was positively correlated with the adult sex ratio (increased male density relative to females), and facultative monogamy was enhanced under a less female-biased sex ratio. A comparison between female and male mating success (number of matings) and the adjustment of the mating status over time revealed that polygyny was advantageous and the optimal mating system for males. Females achieved higher number of matings when pairing with larger males, but mating success was not negatively affected by the actual mating status, and females did not attempt to escape polygyny. Polygyny is therefore considered as the primary mating system in R. aculeatus.","[Ziadi-Kuenzli, Fabienne; Tachihara, Katsunori] Univ Ryukyus, Grad Sch Engn & Sci, 1 Senbaru, Nishihara, Okinawa 9030213, Japan; [Tachihara, Katsunori] Univ Ryukyus, Fac Sci, 1 Senbaru, Nishihara, Okinawa 9030213, Japan",1,10.1007/s00227-015-2780-z,2016

On coral reefs, steep gradients in key environmental variables (e.g. light and wave energy) restrict some species to shallow depths. We show that depth-generalist reef fishes are correlated with two species-level traits: caudal fin aspect ratio and diet. Fishes with high aspect ratio (lunate) caudal fins produce weaker vortices in the water column while swimming, and we propose that 'silent swimming' reduces the likelihood of detection and provides an advantage on deeper reefs with lower light irradiance and water motion. Significant differences in depth preference among trophic guilds reflect variations in the availability of different food sources along a depth gradient. The significance of these two traits across three geographically and taxonomically distinct assemblages suggests that deep-water habitats exert a strong environmental filter on coral reef-fish assemblages.","[Bridge, Tom C.

Conservation challenges require ways of governing that are collaborative and adaptive across boundaries, and where conservation actions are better coordinated, information flows improved, and knowledge better integrated and mobilized. We combine quantitative social network analysis and qualitative data to analyze bridging organizations and their networks, and to understand their contributions and constraints in two case studies in Bali, Indonesia. The analysis shows 1) bridging organizations help to navigate the 'messiness' inherent in conservation settings by compensating for sparse linkages, 2) the particular structure and function of bridging organizations influence governing processes (i.e., collaboration, knowledge sharing) and subsequent conservation outcomes, 3) 'bridging' is accomplished using different strategies and platforms for collaboration and social learning, and 4) bridging organizations enhance flexibility to adjust to changing marine conservation contexts and needs. Understanding the organizations that occupy bridging positions, and how they utilize their positionality in a governance network is emerging as an important determinant of successful conservation outcomes.

Forward-in-time simulations revealed that surface water was transported equatorward and offshore in summer due to the upwelling-favorable winds. In winter, however, water was transported polewards down the WA coast due to the seasonally strong Leeuwin Current. Using backward-in-time simulations, the subsurface transport pathways revealed two main source regions of shelf water reaching Ningaloo Reef: (1) a year-round source to the northeast in the upper 100 m of water column; and (2) during the summer, an additional source offshore and to the west of Ningaloo in depths between similar to 30 and similar to 150 m. Transient wind-driven coastal upwelling, onshore geostrophic transport and stirring by offshore eddies were identified as the important mechanisms influencing the source water origins. The identification of these highly time-dependent transport pathways and source water locations is an essential step towards quantifying how key material (e.g., nutrients, larvae, contaminants, etc.) is exchanged between Ningaloo Reef and the surrounding shelf ocean, and how this is mechanistically coupled to the complex ocean dynamics in this region.","[Xu, Jiangtao; Ivey, Gregory N.; Jones, Nicole L.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Civil Environm & Min Engn, Crawley, Australia; [Xu, Jiangtao; Lowe, Ryan J.; Ivey, Gregory N.; Jones, Nicole L.; Zhang, Zhenlin] Univ Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, Crawley, Australia; [Lowe, Ryan J.; Zhang, Zhenlin] Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Environm, Crawley, Australia; [Lowe, Ryan J.] Univ Western Australia, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Crawley, Australia",1,10.1371/journal.pone.0145822,2016

The percent cover of biofilm and turf algae was also significantly greater in the low Omega(arag) zones, while the number of key grazing taxa remained constant.

Using islands as replicates, we examine whether benthic community structure is associated with human habitation within and among archipelagos and across latitude. While there was no evidence for coral to macroalgal phase shifts across our dataset we did find that the majority of reefs on inhabited islands were dominated by fleshy non-reef-building organisms (turf algae, fleshy macroalgae and non-calcifying invertebrates). By contrast, benthic communities from uninhabited islands were more variable but in general supported more calcifiers and active reef builders (stony corals and crustose coralline algae).

The quantities found in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) suggest that the fish has already established a self-sustaining population in this new ecosystem. There is understandable concern, therefore, that this new arrival may become invasive and spread, yet the invasion risk imposed by this fish has not been assessed. In this study, a computer model was employed to deliver a forecast of the potential range of incursion of N. cyanomos in the GOM spanning 5 years. The model incorporated oceanic water flow in the region, tolerances of this damselfish to the ocean environment, and their reproductive strategy in order to supply a temporal and spatial forecast of their spread. From this study, targeted early detection and removal of the fish can be directed if the fish is deemed a threat to native fauna. On the basis of this work, it is foreseeable that the reefs presently harboring N. cyanomos will likely see increased abundance of this damsel. Immediate attempts to eliminate the fish, therefore, should be focused in nearshore shallow waters spanning Veracruz to Frontera, Mexico. Further, water flows in the southern GOM are not widely conducive to long-distance transport of marine organisms with pelagic larvae, reducing the risk of this damsel permeating the greater GOM over 5 years. Aside from N. cyanomos, this study implicitly adds to mounting evidence supporting a biogeographic disconnect between the Veracruz reef complex and the greater GOM and the Caribbean.","[Johnston, Matthew W.] Nova SE Univ, Halmos Coll Nat Sci & Oceanog, Natl Coral Reef Inst, Guy Harvey Res Inst, 8000 North Ocean Dr, Dania, FL 33004 USA; [Akins, John L.] Reef Environm Educ Fdn, 98300 Overseas Hwy, Key Largo, FL 33037 USA",4,10.1007/s00227-015-2777-7,2016

Before implementing management actions, potential outcomes of alternative management strategies can be evaluated in order to avoid adverse or unintended consequences. In tropical reef ecosystems the continued existence of the cultural and recreational fishing activities and the economically important dive-based tourism and recreation industry rest on sustainably managed marine resources. Through a case study of Guam, an ecosystem model was linked with human behavior models for participation in fishing and diving to evaluate future socio-ecological impacts of different management options. Ecosystem indices for reef status and resilience; and extraction potential were identified to evaluate the performance of alternative management scenarios. These marine ecosystem indices link the natural system to human uses (fishing and dive-based tourism and recreation). Evaluating management scenarios indicate that applying a single management tool, such as input controls or marine preserves, without also managing the watershed, is suboptimal. Combining different management tools has negative near-term costs, particularly for the fishing sector, but these are likely to be outweighed by the long-term benefits obtained from greater species abundance. Adopting watershed management measures in addition to fishery regulations distributes the burden for improving the reef status across multiple sectors that contribute to reef pressures.

The ecosystem is showing signs of deterioration, and this seems to be resulting in large part because of the fishing activities of the Buen Hombre fishermen. The institutional arrangements of the fishermen themselves, and of relevant external organizations, have not kept pace with important technological and demographic changes that have affected the community. This paper presents the results of an analysis that unpacks these processes via a statistical analysis of fishermen behavior and a social network analysis of the ""cofishing"" network that these fishermen constitute. The statistical analysis shows that gear choice is very important in explaining the amount of fish caught, both as a direct factor and as a mediator of other factors such as membership in the local fishermen's association. The social network analysis complements this result by demonstrating that gear choice also serves to segment the fishermen into separate groups, with few direct linkages between them. The resulting gear-based fragmentation of the community is seen to have negative implications for the ability of the fishermen to act collectively to conserve their fishery. The paper concludes with some thoughts and suggestions for how the community might move forward, including expanding the membership of the fishermen's association and strengthening ties between fishing groups as well as ties between the community and relevant governmental agencies.

Storms can be one of the most important disturbances in coral reef ecosystems, and it is crucial to understand their long-term impacts on coral populations. The primary objective of this study was to determine trends in disease prevalence and snail predation on damaged and undamaged colonies of the threatened coral species, Acropora palmate, following an episode of heavy ocean swells in the US Virgin Islands (USVI). At three sites on St. Thomas and St. John, colonies of A. palmata were surveyed monthly over 1 year following a series of large swells in March 2008 that fragmented 30-93% of colonies on monitored reefs. Post-disturbance surveys conducted from April 2008 through March 2009 showed that swell-generated damage to A. palmata caused negative indirect effects that compounded the initial direct effects of physical disturbance. During the 12 months after the swell event, white pox disease prevalence was 41% higher for colonies that sustained damage from the swells than for undamaged colonies (df = 207, p = 0.01) with greatest differences in disease prevalence occurring during warm water months.

Chemistry-based approaches to calculate NEC utilize the drawdown of seawater total alkalinity (TA) combined with residence time to calculate an instantaneous measurement of NEC. Census-based approaches combine annual growth rates with benthic cover and reef structural complexity to estimate NEC occurring over annual timescales. Here, NEC was calculated for Hog Reef in Bermuda using both chemistry and census-based NEC techniques to compare the mass-balance generated by the two methods and identify the dominant biocalcifiers at Hog Reef. Our findings indicate close agreement between the annual 2011 census-based NEC 2.35 +/- 1.01 kg CaCO3.m(-2).y(-1) and chemistry-based NEC 2.23 +/- 1.02 kg CaCO3.m(-2).y(-1) at Hog Reef. An additional record of Hog Reef TA data calculated from an autonomous CO2 mooring measuring pCO(2) and modeled pH(total) every 3-h highlights the dynamic temporal variability in coral reef NEC. This ability for chemistry-based NEC techniques to capture higher frequency variability in coral reef NEC allows the mechanisms driving NEC variability to be explored and tested. Just four coral species, Diploria labyrinthiformis, Pseudodiplon'a strigosa, Millepora alcicornis, and Orbicella franksi, were identified by the census-based NEC as contributing to 94 +/- 19% of the total calcium carbonate production at Hog Reef suggesting these species should be highlighted for conservation to preserve current calcium carbonate production rates at Hog Reef. As coral cover continues to decline globally, the agreement between these NEC estimates suggest that either method, but ideally both methods, may serve as a useful tool for coral reef managers and conservation scientists to monitor the maintenance of coral reef structure and ecosystem services.","[Courtney, Travis A.; Andersson, Andreas J.; Cyronak, Tyler] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Geosci Res Div, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Bates, Nicholas R.; Collins, Andrew; de Putron, Samantha J.; Garley, Rebecca; Hochberg, Eric J.; Johnson, Rodney; Noyes, Tim J.] Bermuda Inst Ocean Sci, St Georges, Bermuda; [Eyre, Bradley D.] Southern Cross Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Ctr Coastal Biogeochem, Lismore, NSW, Australia; [Musielewicz, Sylvia; Sutton, Adrienne J.] Univ Washington, Joint Inst Study Atmosphere & Ocean, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Musielewicz, Sylvia; Sabine, Christopher L.; Sutton, Adrienne J.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, 7600 Sand Point Way Ne, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Toncin, Jessy; Tribollet, Aline] Univ Paris 06, Lab Oceanog & Climat, Inst Pierre Simon Laplace, Inst Rech Dev, Paris, France",9,10.3389/fmars.2016.00181,2016

For their resident endosymbiotic dinoflagellates, primarily from the genus Symbiodinium spp., this represents a photic environment that varies similar to 15-fold in intensity and also differs in spectral composition. We examined photosynthesis in the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata in shallow (3 m) and mesophotic settings (65 m) in the northern Red Sea. Symbiodinium spp. in corals originating from the mesophotic environment consistently performed below their photosynthetic compensation point and also exhibited distinct light harvesting antenna organization. In addition, the non-photochemical quenching activity of Symbiodinium spp. from mesophotic corals was shown to be considerably lower than those found in shallow corals, showing they have fewer defenses to high-light settings. Over a period of almost 4 years, we extensively utilized closed circuit Trimix rebreather diving to perform the study. Phylogenetic analysis showed that shallow corals (3 m) transplanted to a deep reef environment (65 m) maintained their initial Symbiodinium spp. community (clade A), rather than taking on deep low-light clades (clade C), demonstrating that shallow S. pistillata acclimate to low-light mesophotic environments while maintaining their shallow photosynthetic traits. Mesophotic corals exhibited static depth-related chlorophyll content per cell, a decrease in PSI activity and enhanced sigmoidal fluorescence rise kinetics. The sigmoidal fluorescence rise kinetics we observed in mesophotic corals is an indication of energy transfer between photosynthetic units. We postulate that at mesophotic depths, a community of adapted Symbiodinium spp. utilize a unique adaptation to lower light conditions by shifting their light harvesting to a PSII based system, where PSII is structured near PSI, with additional PCP soluble antenna also trapping light that is funneled to the PSI reaction center. In this study, we provide evidence that mesophotic Symbiodinium spp. have developed novel adaptive low-light characteristics consisting of a cooperative system for excitation energy transfer between photosynthetic units that maximizes light utilization.","[Einbinder, Shai; Liran, Oded; Tchernov, Dan] Univ Haifa, Leon H Charney Sch Marine Sci, Haifa, Israel; [Einbinder, Shai] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Evolut Systemat & Ecol, Jerusalem, Israel; [Gruber, David F.] CUNY, Baruch Coll, Dept Nat Sci, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Gruber, David F.] CUNY, Grad Ctr, New York, NY USA; [Salomon, Eitan; Keren, Nrr] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, Jerusalem, Israel; [Liran, Oded; Tchernov, Dan] Interuniv Inst Marine Sci, Elat, Israel",4,10.3389/fmars.2016.00195,2016

Combining 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and electron microscopy, we have assayed the relative abundance of vertically-inherited bacterial symbionts in several stages of the life cycle of Amphimedon queenslandica, a tropical coral reef sponge. We reveal that adult A. queenslandica house a low diversity microbiome dominated by just three proteobacterial OTUs, with a single gammaprotebacterium clearly dominant through much of the life cycle. This ontogenetic perspective has revealed that, although vertical transmission occurs very early in development, the inherited symbionts do not maintain proportional dominance of the bacterial community at every developmental stage. A reproductive bottleneck in the A. queenslandica life cycle is larval settlement, when a free-swimming pelagic larva settles out of the water column onto the benthos and completes metamorphoses into the sessile body plan within just 3-4 days. During this dramatic life cycle transition, an influx of environmentally-derived bacteria leads to a major reorganization of the microbiome, potentially challenging the fidelity and persistence of the vertically-inherited symbiotic relationships. However, dominance of the primary, vertically-inherited symbionts is restored in adult sponges. The mechanisms underlying ontogenetic changes in the bacterial community are unknown, including how the dominance of the primary symbionts is restored in the adult sponge-does the host or symbiont regulate this process? Using high-resolution transcriptional profiling in multiple stages of the A. queenslandica life cycle combined with this natural perturbation of the microbiome immediately following larval settlement, we are beginning to identify candidate host genes associated with animal-bacterial crosstalk. Among the sponge host genes upregulated during the times of active microbiome assembly, there is an enrichment of genes potentially involved in innate immunity, including scavenger receptors, and of genes containing eukaryote-like domains, which have elsewhere been implicated in host-symbiont interactions. Intriguingly, we also see an enrichment of sponge genes arising from ancient horizontal transfer events from bacteria, which raises the possibility that host-bacterial associations in the evolutionary past may help to regulate host-bacterial associations in the ecological present.","[Fieth, Rebecca A.; Gauthier, Marie-Emilie A.; Bayes, Joanne; Degnan, Sandie M.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Marine Genom Lab, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Green, Kathryn M.] Univ Queensland, Ctr Microscopy & Microanal, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",7,10.3389/fmars.2016.00228,2016

The most prevalent symbiont, AqS1, is a sulfur-oxidizing gammaproteobacterium closely related to other demosponge symbionts and to free-living Ectothiorhodospiraceae (Chromatiales). The predicted gene repertoire of AqS1 indicates that it is capable of sulfur oxidation, carbon monoxide oxidation and inorganic phosphate assimilation, and that some of its metabolic capabilities may have been acquired via horizontal gene transfer from alphaproteobacteria. The second most prevalent symbiont, AqS2, is a betaproteobacterium whose closest known relatives are other demosponge symbionts. AqS1 has characteristic sponge symbiont features, including a versatile nutrient use with large number of transporters, ankyrin-repeat-containing proteins, and a CRISPR system. Based on the size of its genome assembly, AqS2 is predicted to have a much smaller genome with many fewer symbiotic features than AqS1. The smaller is reflected in its more limited metabolic capabilities that include carbohydrate metabolism, but not sulfur oxidation or phosphorus metabolism. Within-pathway complementation and resource partitioning potentially occur between the two bacteria. The addition of these symbiont genomes to extensive genome and transcriptome resources already available for the sponge host now permits the development of mixed-species genome-scale metabolic models as a foundation for experimental investigations of resource partitioning between symbionts and host.","[Gauthier, Marie-Emilie A.; Watson, Jabin R.; Degnan, Sandie M.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Marine Genom Lab, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",6,10.3389/fmars.2016.00196,2016

While the nascent field of coral restoration has rapidly progressed in the past decade, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding the drivers of restoration success that may impede our ability to effectively restore coral reef communities. Here, we conducted a field experiment to investigate the influence of coral density on the growth, habitat production, and survival of corals outplanted for restoration. We used nursery-raised colonies of Acropora cervicornis to experimentally establish populations of corals with either 3, 6, 12, or 24 corals within 4m(2) plots, generating a gradient of coral densities ranging from 0.75 corals m(-2) to 12 corals M-2. After 13 months we found that density had a significant effect on the growth, habitat production, and survivorship of restored corals. We found that coral survivorship increased as colony density decreased. Importantly, the signal of density dependent effects was context dependent. Our data suggest that positive density dependent effects influenced habitat production at densities of 3 corals m(-2), but further increases in density resulted in negative density dependent effects with decreasing growth and survivorship of corals. These findings highlight the importance of density dependence for coral restoration planning and demonstrate the need to evaluate the influence of density for other coral species used for restoration. Further work focused on the mechanisms causing density dependence such as increased herbivory, rapid disease transmission, or altered predation rates are important next steps to advance our ability to effectively restore coral reefs.","[Ladd, Mark C.; Shantz, Andrew A.; Burkepile, Deron E.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, North Miami, FL 33181 USA; [Nedimyer, Ken] Coral Restorat Fdn, Key Largo, FL USA; [Ladd, Mark C.; Shantz, Andrew A.; Burkepile, Deron E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",5,10.3389/fmars.2016.00261,2016

These symbionts mediate a complex series of biogeochemical transformations that fuel the holobiont's metabolism. Although sponges are aerobic animals, suboxic and anaerobic bacteria are known to reside within their bodies. However, little is known about the chemical characteristics of the sponge environment in which they occur and almost no data are available regarding the dissolved oxygen (DO) dynamics inside the holobiont in its natural habitat. In this study we examined the oxygen dynamics in situ in the HMA sponge Theonella swinhoei. A submersed data-logging system equipped with micro-sensors was used to continuously record DO concentrations inside the sponge body and in its outflowing water for up to 48 h. Actively pumping sponges exhibited high DO removal rates punctuated with short bursts of extreme DO uptake ( >90 mu mol DO L-pumped(-1)), never before observed in sponges. Such a high DO removal rate indicates the consumption of a considerable amount of reduced matter, far exceeding the available sources in the surrounding water of the oligotrophic coral-reef ecosystem inhabited by this sponge. The inner body of the sponge remained suboxic throughout the experiments, with short events of further rapid DO concentration decline. Moreover, DO concentrations measured in the body and in the outflowing water were found to be uncorrelated. Our findings support a previous hypothesis of bacterial symbiont farming by the sponge as a potential source for acquiring reduced material. Moreover, this suggests a complex and highly localized control of the holobiont's metabolism, probably associated with the microbial community's metabolism. Our results indicate that temporal micro-environments exist in the sponge at alternating locations, providing suitable conditions for the activity of its anaerobic microbial symbionts.","[Lavy, Adi; Keren, Ray; Ilan, Micha] Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Life Sci, Dept Zool, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Yahel, Gitai] Ruppin Acad Ctr, Sch Marine Sci, Mikhmoret, Israel",5,10.3389/fmars.2016.00263,2016

The basic functional unit of coral reefs is the coral metaorganism or holobiont consisting of the cnidarian host animal, symbiotic algae of the genus Symbiodinium, and a specific consortium of bacteria (among others), but research is slow due to the difficulty of working with corals. Aiptasia has proven to be a tractable model system to elucidate the intricacies of cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbioses, but characterization of the associated bacterial microbiome is required to provide a complete and integrated understanding of holobiont function. In this work, we characterize and analyze the microbiome of aposymbiotic and symbiotic Aiptasia and show that bacterial associates are distinct in both conditions. We further show that key microbial associates can be cultured without their cnidarian host. Our results suggest that bacteria play an important role in the symbiosis of Aiptasia with Symbiodinium, a finding that underlines the power of the Aiptasia model system where cnidarian hosts can be analyzed in aposymbiotic and symbiotic states. The characterization of the native microbiome and the ability to retrieve culturable isolates contributes to the resources available for the Aiptasia model system.

In this study, the effects of elevated seawater temperature and partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) on subtropical sediment systems of mangrove, seagrass, and coral reef lagoon habitats of Okinawa, Japan, were examined. Sediment and seawater from each habitat were exposed to four pCO(2)-temperature treatments, including ambient pCO(2)- ambient temperature, ambient pCO(2)-high temperature (ambient temperature + 4 degrees C), high pCO(2) (936 ppm)-ambient temperature, and high pCO(2)-high temperature. Parameters including primary production, nutrient flux, pigment content, photosynthetic community composition, and bacterial abundance were examined. Neither high temperature nor high pCO(2) alone impacted mangrove and seagrass sediment primary production significantly (Tukey's test, P > 0.05). However, the combined stress significantly (Tukey's test, P < 0.01) increased primary production in these two habitats. In sediments from the coral reef lagoon, single and combined stress treatments induced a shift from heterotrophy to autotrophy. Significant increases in net primary production (Tukey's test, P < 0.01), and gross primary production (Tukey's test, P < 0.05) under the combined stress suggested that benthic microalgae in mangrove and seagrass sediments were more responsive to high temperature and pCO(2) conditions than those in coral reef lagoon sediments. Additionally, combined stress significantly increased the sediment chlorophyll a content (Tukey's test, P < 0.05) in all habitats. These increases were associated with increased net primary production, indicating that combined stress stimulates primary production activity by the photosynthetic benthic microalgae in all habitats. Diatom activity increased, as silicate uptake increased in all habitats. Microbial abundance significantly increased under the combined stress treatment (Tukey's test, P < 0.01), but did not exceed autotrophic activity. Respiration did not change significantly in any of the three habitats (Tukey's test, P > 0.05) under the combined stress, suggesting that heterotrophic processes were less affected by the combined stress than autotrophic processes. In summary, mangrove and seagrass sediments minimize the negative impacts of elevated temperature and pCO(2) via increased primary production and carbon storage. Lagoonal sediments also act as a carbon sink under temperature and ocean acidificationstress.","[Sultana, Rumana; Casareto, Beatriz E.; Suzuki, Toshiyuki; Alam, Md Shafiul; Suzuki, Yoshimi] Shizuoka Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Dept Environm & Energy Syst, Shizuoka, Japan; [Casareto, Beatriz E.; Sohrin, Rumi] Shizuoka Univ, Res Inst Green Sci & Technol, Shizuoka, Japan; [Sohrin, Rumi] Shizuoka UniV, Dept Geosci, Shizuoka, Japan; [Fujimura, Hiroyuki] Univ Ryukyus, Dept Chem Biol & Marine Sci, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan",3,10.3389/fmars.2016.00100,2016

Although sediments comprise most of the calcium carbonate (CaCO3) within coral reefs, no in situ studies have looked at the combined effects of increased SST and OA on the dissolution of coral reef CaCO3 sediments. In situ benthic chamber incubations were used to measure dissolution rates in permeable CaCO3 sands under future OA and SST scenarios in a coral reef lagoon on Australia's Great Barrier Reef (Heron Island). End of century (2100) simulations (temperature +2.7 degrees C and pH -0.3) shifted carbonate sediments from net precipitating to net dissolving. Warming increased the rate of benthic respiration (R) by 29% per 1 degrees C and lowered the ratio of productivity to respiration (P/R; Delta P/R = -0.23), which increased the rate of CaCO3 sediment dissolution (average net increase of 18.9 mmol CaCO3 m(-2) d(-1) for business as usual scenarios). This is most likely due to the influence of warming on benthic P/R which, in turn, was an important control on sediment dissolution through the respiratory production of rho CO2. The effect of increasing CO2 on CaCO3 sediment dissolution (average net increase of 6.5 mmol CaCO3 m(-2) d(-1) for business as usual scenarios) was significantly less than the effect of warming. However, the combined effect of increasing both SST and rho CO2 on CaCO3 sediment dissolution was non-additive (average net increase of 5.6 mmol CaCO3 m(-2) d(-1)) due to the different responses of the benthic community. This study highlights that benthic biogeochemical processes, such as metabolism and associated CaCO3 sediment dissolution respond rapidly to changes in SST and OA, and that the response to multiple environmental changes are not necessarily additive.","[Trnovsky, Daniel; Stoltenberg, Laura; Eyre, Bradley D.] Southern Cross Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Ctr Coastal Biogeochem, Lismore, NSW, Australia; [Cyronak, Tyler] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",6,10.3389/fmars.2016.00211,2016

However, such data streams are often lacking for protected species, especially highly mobile marine vertebrates. Using five decades of aerial surveys, we assessed changes in marine megafauna on the insular coral reef ecosystem of Guam (Marianas Archipelago in Micronesia). The data allowed estimates of relative abundance, trends, and geographic distributions for several important taxa: sea turtles, sharks, manta rays, small delphinids, and large delphinids. These surveys occurred in 32 years from 1963 to 2012 amounting to 632 flights lasting 809 h over a 70.16 km(2) area. Over this span, surveyors recorded 10,622 turtle, 1026 shark, 60 manta ray, 7515 small delphinid, and 95 large delphinid observations. Since the 1960s, sea turtles increased an order of magnitude (r = 0.07) and sharks decreased 5-fold (r = -0.03). Turtle increases were largely restricted to one geographic area, where optimal habitat coincides with low human density and a marine protected area. Shark observations declined proximate to human population centers. Trends for the other taxa were less informative, but each taxon had geographic foci. Protections in the region may be working to recover turtle populations, but failing (or have not yet had sufficient time) to recover overfished shark populations. Long-term analyses of vulnerable marine megafauna in this data-limited region are uncommon, and should be used to guide more focused studies that inform regional management and conservation of these species.","[Martin, Summer L.] Natl Acad Sci, Natl Res Council, Washington, DC 20418 USA; [Martin, Summer L.; Jones, T.

We assessed the impact of an episodic disturbance associated with human visitation (boat anchoring) relative to other drivers of long-term change on coral reefs. A one-time anchoring event at Crab Cove, British Virgin Islands, in 2004 caused rapid losses of coral and reef structural complexity that were equal to the cumulative decline over 23 years observed at an adjacent site. The abundance of small site-attached reef fishes dropped by approximately one quarter after the anchoring event, but this drop was not immediate and only fully apparent two years after the anchoring event. There was no obvious recovery from the impact, and no evidence that this episodic impact accelerated or retarded subsequent declines from other causes. This apparent lack of synergism between the effect of this episodic human impact and other chronic stressors is consistent with the few other long-term studies of episodic impacts, and suggests that action to mitigate anchor damage should yield predictable benefits.","[Forrester, Graham E.; Flynn, Rebecca L.; Jarecki, Lianna L.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Forrester, Linda M.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA",2,10.1371/journal.pone.0144498,2015

Recently, two different color morphs of Plectropomus leopardus were discovered and the biological importance of the color difference is unknown. Since coral trout species are poorly characterized at the molecular level, we undertook the transcriptomic characterization of the two color morphs, one black and one red coral trout, using Illumina next generation sequencing technologies. The study produced 55162966 and 54588952 paired-end reads, for black and red trout, respectively. De novo transcriptome assembly generated 95367 and 99424 unique sequences in black and red trout, respectively, with 88813 sequences shared between them. Approximately 50% of both trancriptomes were functionally annotated by BLAST searches against protein databases. The two trancriptomes were enriched into 25 functional categories and showed similar profiles of Gene Ontology category compositions. 34110 unigenes were grouped into 259 KEGG pathways. Moreover, we identified 14649 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and designed primers for potential application. We also discovered 130524 putative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the two transcriptomes, supplying potential genomic resources for the coral trout species. In addition, we identified 936 fast-evolving genes and 165 candidate genes under positive selection between the two color morphs. Finally, 38 candidate genes underlying the mechanism of color and pigmentation were also isolated. This study presents the first transcriptome resources for the common coral trout and provides basic information for the development of genomic tools for the identification, conservation, and understanding of the speciation and local adaptation of coral reef fish species.","[Wang, Le; Yu, Cuiping; Guo, Liang; Lin, Haoran; Meng, Zining] Sun Yat Sen Univ, State Key Lab Biocontrol, Inst Aquat Econ Anim, Sch Life Sci, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Le; Yu, Cuiping; Guo, Liang; Lin, Haoran; Meng, Zining] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Aquat Econ Anim, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China",1,10.1371/journal.pone.0145868,2015

In marine fish, this step involves the use of multiple senses, including audition, olfaction and vision. To date, most investigations of larval fish audition focus on the hearing thresholds to various frequencies of sounds without testing an ecological response to such sounds. Identifying responses to biologically relevant sounds at the development stage in which orientation is most relevant is fundamental. We tested for the existence of ontogenetic windows of reception to sounds that could act as orientation cues with a focus on vulnerability to alteration by human impacts. Here we show that larvae of a catadromous fish species (barramundi, Lates calcarifer) were attracted towards sounds from settlement habitat during a surprisingly short ontogenetic window of approximately 3 days. Yet, this auditory preference was reversed in larvae reared under end-of-century levels of elevated CO2, such that larvae are repelled from cues of settlement habitat. These future conditions also reduced the swimming speeds and heightened the anxiety levels of barramundi. Unexpectedly, an acceleration of development and onset of metamorphosis caused by elevated CO2 were not accompanied by the earlier onset of attraction towards habitat sounds. This mismatch between ontogenetic development and the timing of orientation behaviour may reduce the ability of larvae to locate habitat or lead to settlement in unsuitable habitats. The misinterpretation of key orientation cues can have implications for population replenishment, which are only exacerbated when ontogenetic development decouples from the specific behaviours required for location of settlement habitats.","[Rossi, Tullio; Nagelkerken, Ivan; Pistevos, Jennifer C.

Ecosystembased management that explicitly considers the indirect and cumulative effects of multiple disturbances has been recommended and adopted in policies in many places around the globe. Ecosystem models give insight into complex reef dynamics and their responses to multiple disturbances and are useful tools to support planning and implementation of ecosystem-based management. We adapted the Atlantis Ecosystem Model to incorporate key dynamics for a coral reef ecosystem around Guam in the tropical western Pacific. We used this model to quantify the effects of predicted climate and ocean changes and current levels of current land-based sources of pollution (LBSP) and fishing. We used the following six ecosystem metrics as indicators of ecosystem state, resilience and harvest potential: 1) ratio of calcifying to non-calcifying benthic groups, 2) trophic level of the community, 3) biomass of apex predators, 4) biomass of herbivorous fishes, 5) total biomass of living groups and 6) the end-to-start ratio of exploited fish groups. Simulation tests of the effects of each of the three drivers separately suggest that by mid-century climate change will have the largest overall effect on this suite of ecosystem metrics due to substantial negative effects on coral cover. The effects of fishing were also important, negatively influencing five out of the six metrics. Moreover, LBSP exacerbates this effect for all metrics but not quite as badly as would be expected under additive assumptions, although the magnitude of the effects of LBSP are sensitive to uncertainty associated with primary productivity. Over longer time spans (i.e., 65 year simulations), climate change impacts have a slight positive interaction with other drivers, generally meaning that declines in ecosystem metrics are not as steep as the sum of individual effects of the drivers. These analyses offer one way to quantify impacts and interactions of particular stressors in an ecosystem context and so provide guidance to managers. For example, the model showed that improving water quality, rather than prohibiting fishing, extended the timescales over which corals can maintain high abundance by at least 5-8 years. This result, in turn, provides more scope for corals to adapt or for resilient species to become established and for local and global management efforts to reduce or reverse stressors.","[Weijerman, Mariska] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Joint Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Weijerman, Mariska; Leemans, Rik] Wageningen Univ, Environm Syst Anal Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Weijerman, Mariska; Brainard, Russell E.] NOAA Fisheries, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Honolulu, HI USA; [Fulton, Elizabeth A.; Gorton, Rebecca] CSIRO, Oceans & Atmosphere Flagship, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Kaplan, Isaac C.] NOAA Fisheries, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA USA; [Mooij, Wolf M.] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Aquat Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Mooij, Wolf M.] Wageningen Univ, Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands",19,10.1371/journal.pone.0144165,2015

Coral larval dispersal patterns were analyzed between coral reefs across jurisdictional marine zones to identify spatial relationships between larval sources and destinations within countries and territories across the region.

Our results suggest that approximately 77% of coral reefs identified as having a high regional connectivity value are not included in the existing MPA network. This research is unique because we quantify and report coral larval connectivity data by marine ecoregions and Exclusive Economic Zones (EZZ) and use this information to identify gaps in the current Caribbean-wide MPA network by integrating asymmetric connectivity information in Marxan to design a regional MPA network that includes important reef network connections.

This paper examines two fisheries co-management programs, American Samoa's Community-based Fisheries Management Program (CFMP) and Hawai'i's Community-based Subsistence Fisheries Area (CBSFA) legislation, using a framework of design principles derived from common property theory. The two programs provide an interesting contrast; while American Samoa's CFMP program has been successfully implemented in eleven communities, the Hawai'i program has struggled, with no CBSFA fully implemented for over 20 years. The purpose of this analysis is threefold: to utilize the design principles to assess the likelihood that a given fisheries co-management program will have a successful outcome; to test the design principles to determine how well these principles can serve as predictors for the outcomes seen in these two different programs; and to develop recommendations for how these design principles might be used to strengthen these two programs, as well as improve other fisheries co-management programs and policies in the future. The analysis reveals that the design principles provide a useful framework through which to assess co-management programs. Our analysis reveals that the principles can provide important insights for understanding the differential outcomes of the two programs as well as provide guidance for how these and other programs can be strengthened in the future.

Legislation mandated the state of Hawai'i's natural resource management agency work with community residents to co-create and enforce rules for the fishery. By selecting a model case in which rule making has taken seven years longer than predicted, despite the presence of many established enabling conditions, this study elucidates new factors for consideration in early phases of co-management. These include legal uncertainty regarding statutory mandates, the role of bridging organizations in capacity building, cross-generational leadership development, and connection of the co-management rule-making process to the target geography.

Economic assessments of coral reef provisioning services afforded to rural communities in Solomon Islands identified a diverse range of fisheries-based (fish, seaweed, clam, trochus, crayfish and shells) and coral-based (sand, rubble, stone, and corals for lime, aquarium and curio trades) products. Fisheries products (in particular reef fish) were important for both village subsistence and cash economies, providing the equivalent of US $5173 (+/-515) annually per respondent. In contrast, coral products contributed the equivalent of US $2213 (+/-396) annually per respondent, primarily to cash economies, particularly in study villages located in close proximity to national markets. Extractive coral activities have the potential to reduce reef resilience, diminish the viability of fisheries and so compromise the livelihoods of dependent communities.

The use of multiple methods for quantifying illegal harvest has been widely recommended yet infrequently applied. We used a mixed-method approach to evaluate the extent, character, and motivations of illegal gillnet fishing in Lake Hovsgol National Park, Mongolia and its impact on the lake's fish populations, especially that of the endangered endemic Hovsgol grayling (Thymallus nigrescens). Surveys for derelict fishing gear indicate that gillnet fishing is widespread and increasing and that fishers generally use 3-4 cm mesh gillnet. Interviews with resident herders and park rangers suggest that many residents fish for subsistence during the spring grayling spawning migration and that some residents fish commercially year-round. Interviewed herders and rangers generally agree that fish population sizes are decreasing but are divided on the causes and solutions. Biological monitoring indicates that the gillnet mesh sizes used by fishers efficiently target Hovsgol grayling. Of the five species sampled in the monitoring program, only burbot (Lota lota) showed a significant decrease in population abundance from 2009-2013. However, grayling, burbot, and roach (Rutilus rutilus) all showed significant declines in average body size, suggesting a negative fishing impact. Data-poor stock assessment methods suggest that the fishing effort equivalent to each resident family fishing 50-m of gillnet 11-15 nights per year would be sufficient to over-exploit the grayling population. Results from the derelict fishing gear survey and interviews suggest that this level of effort is not implausible. Overall, we demonstrate the ability for a mixed-method approach to effectively describe an illegal fishery and suggest that these methods be used to assess illegal fishing and its impacts in other protected areas.","[Free, Christopher M.; Jensen, Olaf P.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Marine & Coastal Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Mendsaikhan, Bud] Mongolian Acad Sci, Inst Geoecol, Ulaanbaatar 15170, Mongol Peo Rep",8,10.1371/journal.pone.0143960,2015

While the contributions of endosymbionts to cnidarian hosts have been extensively documented, relatively little is known about how exosymbionts contribute to nutrient cycling in coral reef cnidarians. We investigated exosymbiotic sources of ammonia and their contributions to physiological processes in Caribbean corkscrew sea anemones Bartholomea annulata. In laboratory experiments, anemones absorbed ammonia from seawater, which significantly enhanced the mitotic index of their endosymbiotic microalgae Symbiodinium, while anemone shrimp presence alone had no effect. Anemone shrimps excreted ammonia at much slower rates than anemones were able to absorb it, indicating that shrimp alone were not able to meet host nitrogen demand. Client fishes excreted ammonia similar to 10x more rapidly than did associated shrimps. On Caribbean coral reefs, anemone shrimps attract diverse client fishes through their parasite-cleaning behavior; these fishes excrete substantial ammonia near anemones while being cleaned. Exosymbiotic anemone shrimps thus may provide nutritional benefits to host anemones and microalgae indirectly, through their attraction of nitrogen-excreting fishes. This multi-level mutualistic network facilitates tight nutrient cycling among diverse species belonging to several phyla on coral reefs. While we assessed the rates and benefits of nutrient transfer under laboratory conditions, further research is needed to quantify the contributions of ammonia and other nutrients from client fishes through cleaner shrimps to host sea anemones in the field.","[Cantrell, C.

Here, we examine the influence of temperature and other environmental variables on key early life traits of the coral reef damselfish, Pomacentrus moluccensis, based on ten cohorts of newly settled fish collected over 13 years from around Lizard Island (Great Barrier Reef, Australia). Pelagic larval duration (PLD), larval growth and size at settlement were estimated through otolith microstructure analysis. Multiple regression techniques were used to measure the strength of the associations between these traits and developmental temperature, rain, wind speed and solar radiation. Temperature accounted for 18.4, 26.7 and 25.0 % of the variability in PLD, growth rates and settlement size, respectively. PLDs generally declined and growth rates generally increased with increasing temperatures to similar to 28 A degrees C, above which PLDs tended to increase and growth rates tended to decrease. Size at settlement did not differ between similar to 25 and similar to 28 A degrees C, but tended to decrease with increasing temperature above similar to 28 A degrees C. Together rain, wind speed and solar radiation explained 6.3, 26.3 and 33.7 % of the remaining variability in PLD, growth rates and size at settlement, respectively. Higher wind speeds were generally associated with longer PLDs. Increasing wind, high rainfall and increasing solar radiation were associated with slower growth rates and smaller sizes at settlement. Overall, results suggest that similar to 28 A degrees C is likely to be a thermal optimum for larval development for this species and other environmental factors associated with climate change including rainfall, wind speed and solar radiation should be considered in predictions of effects on larval fish.","[McLeod, Ian M.; Jones, Rhondda E.; Jones, Geoffrey P.; Takahashi, Miwa; McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [McLeod, Ian M.; Jones, Geoffrey P.; McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [McLeod, Ian M.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, JCU, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Takahashi, Miwa] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia",4,10.1007/s00227-015-2765-y,2015

Most species (85 %) preyed on polychaete worms. One preyed exclusively on a hemichordate worm, two on fishes, and three on gastropods. In general, species specialized more on different prey taxa than different microhabitats. These results are generally consistent with those previously reported for Conus spp. assemblages in similar habitats elsewhere in the tropical Indo-Pacific. They support the hypotheses that (1) resource partitioning, especially of food resources but also of microhabitats, facilitates assemblages of numerous co-occurring Conus spp. and their avoidance of interspecific competition, and (2) ecological differentiation has contributed importantly to the striking Cenozoic adaptive radiation of Conus. The fieldwork, in 1957-1958, also provides baseline data for future studies of how changing marine environmental conditions affect coral reef-associated biotas.","[Kohn, Alan J.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",1,10.1007/s00227-015-2766-x,2015

Whilst some recovery has been observed, this has been restricted to the shallows (a parts per thousand currency sign5 m). We report a newly discovered, isolated population recovery on Banco Capiro, Honduras, representing the largest recorded post-mortality densities beyond the shallowest environments (0.74-2.27 individuals m(-2) at depths a parts per thousand yen10 m) alongside an unusually high mean percentage scleractinian coral cover of 49-62 %, likely no coincidence. On the nearby island of Utila, we report D. antillarum densities of 0.003-0.012 individuals m(-2) and scleractinian coral cover of 12 % at depths a parts per thousand yen10 m, ""typical"" for a contemporary Caribbean coral reef. The three order of magnitude disparity in population density between sites separated by < 60 km presents a unique opportunity to investigate barriers preventing their region-wide recovery by simultaneously addressing a range of previously proposed hypotheses. Despite concerns over the impacts of asynchronous spawning in low-density populations, we find that recruitment is occurring on Utila. This suggests that, whilst Allee effects are likely to be a contributing factor, the major barriers suppressing recovery are instead impacting juvenile survival into adulthood. Similarly, variations in heterospecific echinoids, interspecific competitors, and nutrient availability fail to account for population differences. Instead, we highlight a lack of structural complexity on contemporary Caribbean reefs as the most likely explanation for the limited recovery through a lack of provision of juvenile predation refugia, representing a further consequence of the recent ubiquitous phase shifts throughout the region. Using these findings, we propose future management strategies to stimulate recovery and, consequently, reef health throughout the Caribbean.","[Bodmer, Max D.

This study used exclusion cages with two different mesh sizes (1 x 1 cm and 6 x 6 cm) to investigate the impact of different-sized herbivores on algal accumulation rates on the shallow (< 2 m) back-reef of Agatti atoll, Lakshadweep. The fine-mesh cages excluded all visible herbivores, which had rapid and lasting effects on the benthic communities, and, after 127 d of deployment, there was a visible and significant increase in algae (mainly macroalgae) with algal volume being 13 times greater than in adjacent open areas. The coarse-mesh cages excluded larger fishes (> 8 cm body depth) while allowing smaller fishes to access the plots. In contrast to the conclusions of most previous studies, the exclusion of large herbivores had no significant effect on the accumulation of benthic algae and the amount of algae present within the coarse-mesh cages was relatively consistent throughout the experimental period (around 50 % coverage and 1-2 mm height). The difference in algal accumulation between the fine-mesh and coarse-mesh cages appears to be related to the actions of small individuals from 12 herbivorous fish species (0.17 ind. m(-2) and 7.7 g m(-2)) that were able to enter through the coarse mesh. Although restricted to a single habitat, these results suggest that when present in sufficient densities and diversity, small herbivorous fishes can prevent the accumulation of algal biomass on coral reefs.","[Cernohorsky, Nicole H.; Horsak, Michal] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Bot & Zool, CS-61137 Brno, Czech Republic; [McClanahan, Timothy R.] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Marine Programs, Bronx, NY 10460 USA; [Babu, Idrees] Coral Reef Res, Dept Sci & Technol, Ut Of Lakshadweep 682555, India",4,10.1007/s00338-015-1331-x,2015

While environmental acclimation to turbid and low-light conditions has been extensively studied in corals, far less is known about other phototrophic reef invertebrates. The photosynthetic cyanobacteria containing sponge Lamellodysidea herbacea is one of the most abundant sponges in the Wakatobi Marine National Park (WMNP, Indonesia), and its abundance is greatest at highly disturbed, turbid sites. This study investigated photoacclimation of L. herbacea symbionts to turbid reef sites using in situ PAM fluorometry combined with shading and transplant experiments at environmental extremes of light availability for this species. We found in situ photoacclimation of L. herbacea to both shallow, clear, high-light environments and deep, turbid, low-light environments. Shading experiments provide some evidence that L. herbacea are dependent on nutrition from their photosymbionts as significant tissue loss was seen in shaded sponges. Symbionts within surviving shaded tissue showed evidence of photoacclimation. Lamellodysidea herbacea transplanted from high- to low-light conditions appeared to have photoacclimated within 5 d with no significant effect of the lowered light level on survival. This ability of L. herbacea to photoacclimate to rapid and extreme changes in light availability may be one of the factors contributing to their survival on more turbid reef sites in the WMNP. Our study highlights the ability of some sponge species to acclimate to changes in light levels as a result of increased turbidity.","[Biggerstaff, A.; Bell, J.

Yet, not all corals are equally susceptible to bleaching, and we lack a clear understanding of the mechanisms underpinning their differential susceptibilities. Here, we focus on cellular redox regulation as a potential determinant of bleaching susceptibility in the reef coral Stylophora pistillata. Using slow heating (1 A degrees C d(-1)) and altered irradiance, we induced bleaching in S. pistillata colonies sampled from two depths [5-8 m (shallow) and 15-18 m (deep)]. There was significant depth-dependent variability in the timing and extent of bleaching (loss of symbiont cells), as well as in host enzymatic antioxidant activity [specifically, superoxide dismutase and catalase (CAT)]. However, among the coral fragments that bleached, most did so without displaying any evidence of a host enzymatic antioxidant response. For example, both deep and shallow corals suffered significant symbiont loss at elevated temperature, but only deep colonies exposed to high temperature and high light displayed any up-regulation of host antioxidant enzyme activity (CAT). Surprisingly, this preceded the equivalent antioxidant responses of the symbiont, which raises questions about the source(s) of hydrogen peroxide in the symbiosis. Overall, changes in enzymatic antioxidant activity in the symbionts were driven primarily by irradiance rather than temperature, and responses were similar across depth groups. Taken together, our results suggest that in the absence of light stress, heating of 1 A degrees C d(-1) to 4 A degrees C above ambient is not sufficient to induce a substantial oxidative challenge in S. pistillata. We provide some of the first evidence that regulation of coral enzymatic antioxidants can vary significantly depending on habitat, and, in terms of determining bleaching susceptibility, our results suggest a significant role for the host's differential regulation of cellular redox status.","[Hawkins, Thomas D.; Krueger, Thomas; Wilkinson, Shaun P.; Fisher, Paul L.; Davy, Simon K.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington 6140, New Zealand; [Hawkins, Thomas D.] Univ Delaware, Coll Earth Ocean & Environm, Lewes, DE 19958 USA; [Krueger, Thomas] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Biol Geochem, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn ENAC, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Fisher, Paul L.] Univ Queensland, Sch Civil Engn, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",18,10.1007/s00338-015-1345-4,2015

Regardless of treatment temperature, fish preferred 29.5 +/- A 0.25 A degrees C, approximating summer average temperatures in the wild.

Monitoring in situ environmental parameters on coral reefs in conjunction with the movements of fishes can help explain the relationship between exploited populations and their environment. Sixty adult Lethrinus miniatus were acoustically tagged and monitored along a coral reef slope for up to 1 yr. Individuals occurred more often on the reef slope during days of cooler temperatures, suggesting a thermal tolerance threshold may exist. Results indicate that individuals responded to elevated temperatures by moving away from the reef slope to deeper adjacent habitats, thus shifting their position in the water column to remain at a preferred temperature. Space use within the water column (vertical activity space) was not influenced by environmental parameters or fish size, but this result was possibly influenced by use of deeper habitat outside the acoustic array that was not monitored. With elevation of ocean temperature, L. miniatus may need to adapt to warmer waters or disperse into cooler habitats, by either shifting their distribution deeper or towards higher latitudes. Identifying key environmental drivers that affect the distribution of reef fishes is important, and may allow managers to predict the effect of these changes on exploited species.","[Currey, Leanne M.] James Cook Univ, AIMS JCU, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Currey, Leanne M.; Heupel, Michelle R.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Currey, Leanne M.; Heupel, Michelle R.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.; Williams, Ashley J.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Currey, Leanne M.; Heupel, Michelle R.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.; Williams, Ashley J.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Williams, Ashley J.] Secretariat Pacific Commun, Ocean Fisheries Programme, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia",12,10.1007/s00338-015-1318-7,2015

Although variation in key biological characteristics has been explored on the scale of 100-1000 s of km, it has rarely been explored at the scale relevant to actual larval dispersal and population connectivity on ecological timescales. In this study, we surveyed the habitat and collected specimens (n = 447) of juvenile butterflyfish, Chaetodon vagabundus, at nine sites along an 80-km stretch of coastline in the central Philippines to identify variation in key life history parameters at a spatial scale relevant to population connectivity. Mean pelagic larval duration (PLD) was 24.03 d (SE = 0.16 d), and settlement size was estimated to be 20.54 mm total length (TL; SE = 0.61 mm). Both traits were spatially consistent, although this PLD is considerably shorter than that reported elsewhere. In contrast, post-settlement daily growth rates, calculated from otolith increment widths from 1 to 50 d post-settlement, varied strongly across the study region. Elevated growth rates were associated with rocky habitats that this species is known to recruit to, but were strongly negatively correlated with macroalgal cover and exhibited negative density dependence with conspecific juveniles. Larger animals had lower early (first 50 d post-settlement) growth rates than smaller animals, even after accounting for seasonal variation in growth rates. Both VBGF and Gompertz models provided good fits to post-settlement size-at-age data (n = 447 fish), but the VBGF's estimate of asymptotic length (L (a) = 168 mm) was more consistent with field observations of maximum fish length. Our findings indicate that larval characteristics are consistent at the spatial scale at which populations are likely well connected, but that site-level biological differences develop post-settlement, most likely as a result of key differences in quality of recruitment habitat.","[Leahy, Susannah M.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Cairns, Qld 4878, Australia; [Leahy, Susannah M.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Trop Environm & Sustainabil Sci, Cairns, Qld 4878, Australia; [Leahy, Susannah M.; Russ, Garry R.; Abesamis, Rene A.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Cairns, Qld 4878, Australia; [Russ, Garry R.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Abesamis, Rene A.] Silliman Univ, Angelo King Ctr Res & Environm Management SUAKCRE, Dumaguete 6200, Negros Oriental, Philippines",3,10.1007/s00338-015-1330-y,2015

The assay consists of a 1.3-cm diameter disk of dried squid mantle tethered to a rod, which is either inserted in the sediment in soft-bottom habitats or secured to existing structure. Each replicate squidpop is scored as present or absent after 1 and 24 hours, and the data for analysis are proportions of replicate units consumed at each time. Tests in several habitats of the temperate southeastern USA (Virginia and North Carolina) and tropical Central America (Belize) confirmed the assay's utility for measuring variation in predation intensity among habitats, among seasons, and along environmental gradients. In Belize, predation intensity varied strongly among habitats, with reef > seagrass = mangrove > unvegetated bare sand. Quantitative visual surveys confirmed that assayed feeding intensity increased with abundance and species richness of fishes across sites, with fish abundance and richness explaining up to 45% and 70% of the variation in bait loss respectively. In the southeastern USA, predation intensity varied seasonally, being highest during summer and declining in late autumn. Deployments in marsh habitats generally revealed a decline in mean predation intensity from fully marine to tidal freshwater sites. The simplicity, economy, and standardization of the squidpop assay should facilitate engagement of scientists and citizens alike, with the goal of constructing high-resolution maps of how top-down control varies through space and time in aquatic ecosystems, and addressing a broad array of long-standing hypotheses in macro-and community ecology.","[Duffy, J.

Here, in a 5-y study of the Bermuda coral reef, we show evidence that variations in reef biogeochemical processes drive interannual changes in seawater pH and Omega(aragonite) that are partly controlled by offshore processes. Rapid acidification events driven by shifts toward increasing net calcification and net heterotrophy were observed during the summers of 2010 and 2011, with the frequency and extent of such events corresponding to increased offshore productivity. These events also coincided with a negative winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, which historically has been associated with extensive offshore mixing and greater primary productivity at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) site.

In marine populations, empirical estimates of these parameters are rare, due at least in part to the pelagic dispersal stage common to most marine organisms. Here, we evaluate population persistence and turnover for a population of orange downfish, Amphiprion percula, at Kimbe Island in Papua New Guinea. All fish in the population were sampled and genotyped on five occasions at 2-year intervals spanning eight years. The genetic data enabled estimates of reproductive success retained in the same population (reproductive success to self-recruitment), reproductive success exported to other subpopulations (reproductive success to local connectivity), and immigration and mortality rates of sub-adults and adults. Approximately 50% of the recruits were assigned to parents from the Kimbe Island population and this was stable through the sampling period. Stability in the proportion of local and immigrant settlers is likely due to: low annual mortality rates and stable egg production rates, and the short larval stages and sensory capacities of reef fish larvae. Biannual mortality rates ranged from 0.09 to 0.55 and varied significantly spatially. We used these data to parametrize a model that estimated the probability of the Kimbe Island population persisting in the absence of immigration. The Kimbe Island population was found to persist without significant immigration. Model results suggest the island population persists because the largest of the subpopulations are maintained due to having low mortality and high self-recruitment rates. Our results enable managers to appropriately target and scale actions to maximize persistence likelihood as disturbance frequencies increase.","[Salles, Oceane C.; Maynard, Jeffrey A.; Almany, Glenn R.; Planes, Serge] USR 3278 CNRS EPHE UPVD CRIOBE, Lab Excellence CORAIL, Perpignan, France; [Maynard, Jeffrey A.] SymbioSeas & Marine Appl Res Ctr, Wilmington, NC 28411 USA; [Joannides, Marc] Univ Montpellier 2, UMR 5149 I3M, F-34095 Montpellier, France; [Barbu, Corentin M.] Univ Penn, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Ctr Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Saenz-Agudelo, Pablo] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Ciencias Ambient & Evolut, Valdivia, Chile; [Berumen, Michael L.] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Red Sea Res Ctr, Div Biol & Environm Sci & Engn, Thuwal 23955, Saudi Arabia; [Thorrold, Simon R.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Jones, Geoffrey P.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Jones, Geoffrey P.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",5,10.1098/rspb.2015.1311,2015

Impacts of damselfish lawns on A. cervicornis colonies were more prevalent (21.6% of colonies) than those of other sources of mortality (i.e., disease (1.6%), algal/sponge overgrowth (5.6%), and corallivore predation (7.9%)), and damselfish activities caused the highest levels of tissue mortality (34.6%) among all coral stressors evaluated. The probability of damselfish occupation increased as coral colony size and complexity increased and coral growth rates were significantly lower in colonies with damselfish lawns (15.4 vs. 29.6 cm per year). Reduced growth and mortality of existing A. cervicornis populations may have a significant effect on population dynamics by potentially reducing important genetic diversity and the reproductive potential of depleted populations. On a positive note, however, the presence of resident damselfishes decreased predation by other corallivores, such as Coralliophila and Hermodice, and may offset some negative impacts caused by algal farming. While most negative impacts of damselfishes identified in this study affected large individual colonies and <50% of the A. cervicornis population along the FRT, the remaining wild staghorn population, along with the rapidly increasing restored populations, continue to fulfill important functional roles on coral reefs by providing essential habitat and refuge to other reef organisms. Although the effects of damselfish predation are, and will continue to be, pervasive, successful restoration efforts and strategic coral transplantation designs may help overcome damselfish damage by rapidly increasing A. cervicornis cover and abundance while also providing important information to educate future conservation and management decisions.","[Schopmeyer, Stephanie A.; Lirman, Diego] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Dept Marine Biol & Ecol, Miami, FL 33149 USA",13,10.1371/journal.pone.0141302,2015

While remote sensing and open water sampling already described the physical nature of this upwelling, the spatial and temporal effects on key parameters and processes in the water column have not been investigated yet, although being highly relevant for coral reef functioning. The present study investigated a range of water parameters on two coral reefs with different exposure to upwelling (Matapalo and Bajo Rojo) in a weekly to monthly resolution over one year (May 2013 to April 2014). Based on air temperature, wind speed and water temperature, three time clusters were defined: a) May to November 2013 without upwelling, b) December 2013 to April 2014 with moderate upwelling, punctuated by c) extreme upwelling events in February, March and April 2014. During upwelling peaks, water temperatures decreased by 7 degrees C (Matapalo) and 9 degrees C (Bajo Rojo) to minima of 20.1 and 15.3 degrees C respectively, while phosphate, ammonia and nitrate concentrations increased 3 to 15-fold to maxima of 1.3 mu mol PO43- L-1, 3.0 mu mol NH4+ L-1 and 9.7 mu mol NO3- L-1. This increased availability of nutrients triggered several successive phytoplankton blooms as indicated by 3-(Matapalo) and 6-fold (Bajo Rojo) increases in chlorophyll a concentrations. Particulate organic carbon and nitrogen (POC and PON) increased by 40 and 70% respectively from February to April 2014. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) increased by 70% in December and stayed elevated for at least 4 months, indicating high organic matter release by primary producers. Such strong cascading effects of upwelling on organic matter dynamics on coral reefs have not been reported previously, although likely impacting many reefs in comparable upwelling systems.","[Stuhldreier, Ines; Sanchez-Noguera, Celeste; Rixen, Tim; Wild, Christian] Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Ecol, Bremen, Germany; [Stuhldreier, Ines; Wild, Christian] Univ Bremen, Fac Biol & Chem, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Sanchez-Noguera, Celeste; Cortes, Jorge; Morales, Alvaro] Univ Costa Rica, Ctr Invest Ciencias Mar & Limnol, San Jose, Costa Rica",8,10.1371/journal.pone.0142681,2015

The pattern of connectivity among populations can be described by the measurement of a dispersal kernel. However, a statistically robust, empirical dispersal kernel has been lacking for any marine species. Here, we use genetic parentage analysis to quantify a dispersal kernel for the reef fish Elacatinus lori, demonstrating that dispersal declines exponentially with distance. The spatial scale of dispersal is an order of magnitude less than previous estimates-the median dispersal distance is just 1.7 km and no dispersal events exceed 16.4 km despite intensive sampling out to 30 km from source. Overlaid on this strong pattern is subtle spatial variation, but neither pelagic larval duration nor direction is associated with the probability of successful dispersal. Given the strong relationship between distance and dispersal, we show that distance-driven logistic models have strong power to predict dispersal probabilities. Moreover, connectivity matrices generated from these models are congruent with empirical estimates of spatial genetic structure, suggesting that the pattern of dispersal we uncovered reflects long-term patterns of gene flow. These results challenge assumptions regarding the spatial scale and presumed predictors of marine population connectivity. We conclude that if marine reserve networks aim to connect whole communities of fishes and conserve biodiversity broadly, then reserves that are close in space (<10 km) will accommodate those members of the community that are short-distance dispersers.","[D'Aloia, Cassidy C.; Majoris, John E.; Buston, Peter M.] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [D'Aloia, Cassidy C.; Majoris, John E.; Buston, Peter M.] Boston Univ, Marine Program, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Bogdanowicz, Steven M.; Harrison, Richard G.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Francis, Robin K.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",43,10.1073/pnas.1513754112,2015

Despite considerable study, the selective advantage of alarm cues remains unclear. In an attempt to investigate one of the more promising hypotheses concerning the evolution of alarm cues, we examined whether the cue functions in a fashion analogous to the distress vocalizations emitted by many terrestrial animals. Our results suggest that chemical alarm cues in damselfish (Pomacentridae) may have evolved to benefit the cue sender by attracting secondary predators who disrupt the predation event, allowing the prey a greater chance to escape. The coral reef piscivore, the dusky dottyback (Pseudochromis fuscus), chemically eavesdrops on predation events and uses chemical alarm cues from fish prey (lemon damselfish; Pomacentrus moluccensis) in an attempt to find and steal prey from primary predators. Field studies showed that Ps. fuscus aggregate at sites where prey alarm cue has been experimentally released. Furthermore, secondary predators attempted to steal captured prey of primary predators in laboratory trials and enhanced prey escape chances by 35-40%. These results are the first, to the best of our knowledge, to demonstrate a mechanism by which marine fish may benefit from the production and release of alarm cues, and highlight the complex and important role that semiochemicals play in marine predator-prey interactions.","[Loennstedt, Oona M.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",7,10.1098/rspb.2015.2038,2015

Yet, mesophotic reefs may serve as potential refugia for shallow-water species and thus understanding biodiversity, ecology and connectivity of deep reef communities is integral for resource management and conservation. The Caribbean coral, Montastraea cavernosa, is considered a depth generalist and is commonly found at mesophotic depths. We surveyed abundance and size-frequency of M. cavernosa populations at six shallow (10m) and six upper mesophotic (45m) sites in Bermuda and found population structure was depth dependent. The mean surface area of colonies at mesophotic sites was significantly smaller than at shallow sites, suggesting that growth rates and maximum colony surface area are limited on mesophotic reefs. Colony density was significantly higher at mesophotic sites, however, resulting in equal contributions to overall percent cover. Size-frequency distributions between shallow and mesophotic sites were also significantly different with populations at mesophotic reefs skewed towards smaller individuals. Overall, the results of this study provide valuable baseline data on population structure, which indicate that the mesophotic reefs of Bermuda support an established population of M. cavernosa.","[Goodbody-Gringley, Gretchen] Bermuda Inst Ocean Sci, St Georges GE 01, Bermuda; [Marchini, Chiara; Goffredo, Stefano] Univ Bologna, Marine Sci Grp, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Chequer, Alex D.] Ocean Support Fdn, Hamilton HM 11, Bermuda",6,10.1371/journal.pone.0142427,2015

We propose an MPA design approach that includes spatially-and temporally-varying sea-surface temperature (SST) data, integrating both observed (1985-2009) and projected (2010-2099) time-series. We derived indices of acute (time under reduced ecosystem function following short-term events) and chronic thermal stress (rate of warming) and combined them to delineate thermal-stress regimes. Coral reefs located on the Brazilian coast were used as a case study because they are considered a conservation priority in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. We show that all coral reef areas in Brazil have experienced and are projected to continue to experience chronic warming, while acute events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity. We formulated quantitative conservation objectives for regimes of thermal stress. Based on these objectives, we then evaluated if/how they are achieved in existing Brazilian MPAs and identified priority areas where additional protection would reinforce resilience. Our results show that, although the current system of MPAs incorporates locations within some of our thermal-stress regimes, historical and future thermal refugia along the central coast are completely unprotected. Our approach is applicable to other marine ecosystems and adds to previous marine planning for climate change in two ways: (i) by demonstrating how to spatially configure MPAs that meet conservation objectives for warming disturbance using spatially-and temporally-explicit data; and (ii) by strategically allocating different forms of spatial management (MPA types) intended to mitigate warming impacts and also enhance future resistance to climate warming.","[Magris, Rafael A.; Pressey, Robert L.] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Heron, Scott F.] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm Coral Reef Watch, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Heron, Scott F.] James Cook Univ, Dept Phys, Marine Geophys Lab, Coll Sci Technol & Engn, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",10,10.1371/journal.pone.0140828,2015

However, independent of overfishing, tourism can degrade coral reefs through coastal development, as well as the physical presence of tourists within the ecosystem, the effects of which remain poorly understood. We combined a 3-year dataset on coral and algal cover with a more extensive survey of the benthic community to examine the effect of intensive tourism on a coral reef in Akumal Bay, Mexico. Results from our 3-year dataset indicated that near the peak snorkeling area in the bay, coral cover decreased by 79 % from summer 2011 through summer 2014, a period in which the number of monthly snorkelers increased by more than 400 %. Our summer 2013 survey of the benthic community between sites within a zone of dense snorkeler traffic versus site at a nearby control location revealed negative effects of intensive tourism on particular coral morphologies and on the abundance of herbivorous reef fishes. Our results suggest that uncontrolled tourism, including accelerating growth in the number of snorkelers, is likely contributing to the decline of the coral reef in Akumal Bay, where further expansions in tourism are planned. Indeed, the ecosystems threatened by overexploitation via tourism in the Mayan Riviera also form the basis for the regional tourism industry. Thus, long-term ecological monitoring coupled with the establishment and enforcement of regulations on tourism may be essential for the sustainability of coral reefs, as well as the socioeconomic benefits they provide in Mexico.","[Gil, Michael A.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Renfro, Bobbie; Dunton, Kenneth H.] Univ Texas Dallas, Inst Marine Sci, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USA; [Renfro, Bobbie] Auburn Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Figueroa-Zavala, Baruch; Penie, Ivan] Ctr Ecol Akumal, Akumal 77776, Quintana Roo, Mexico",14,10.1007/s00227-015-2748-z,2015

Empirical data on the interaction between these traits are inconsistent; revealing positive, negative or no relationships. It is generally expected that the investment in pre- and postcopulatory traits is mediated by environmental conditions. To test how dietary resource availability affects sexual ornamentation, sperm quality and their interrelationship in three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), full-sibling groups were raised under three conditions differing in food quantity and/or quality (i.e. carotenoid content): (i) high-quantity/high-quality, (ii) high-quantity/low-quality or (iii) low-quantity/low-quality. After 1 year of feeding, food-restricted males developed a more intense breeding coloration and faster sperm compared with their well-fed brothers, indicating that they allocated relatively more in pre- and postcopulatory traits. Moreover, they outcompeted their well-fed, carotenoid-supplemented brothers in sperm competition trials with equal numbers of competing sperm, suggesting that food-restricted males maximize their present reproductive success. This may result in reduced future reproductive opportunities as food-restricted males suffered from a higher mortality, had an overall reduced body size, and sperm number available for fertilization. In accordance with theory, a trade-off between the investment in pre-and postcopulatory traits was observed in food-restricted males, whereas well-fed males were able to allocate to both traits resulting in a significantly positive relationship.","[Mehlis, Marion; Rick, Ingolf P.; Bakker, Theo C.

Subsequently, an Irish Aid funded IUCN Eastern Africa program operated from 1994 to mid 2007 to implement increasedmanagement aimed at reducing these impacts. Themain effects of this management were to establish collaborative management areas, reduce dynamite and seine net fishing, and establish small community fisheries closures beginning in 1996. The ecology of the coral reefs was studied just prior to the initiation of this management in 1996, during, 2004, and a few years after the project ended in 2010. The perceptions of resource users towards management options were evaluated in 2010. The ecological studies indicated that the biomass of fish rose continuously during this period from 260 to 770 kg/ ha but the small closures were no different from the non-closure areas. The benthic community studies indicate stability in the coral cover and community composition and an increase in coralline algae and topographic complexity over time. The lack of change in the coral community suggests resilience to various disturbances including fisheries management and the warm temperature anomaly of 1998. These results indicate that some aspects of the management program had been ecologically successful even after the donor program ended. Moreover, the increased compliance with seine net use and dynamite restrictions were the most likely factors causing this increase in fish biomass and not the closures. Resource users interviewed in 2010 were supportive of gear restrictions but there was considerable between-community disagreement over the value of specific restrictions. The social-ecological results suggest that increased compliance with gear restrictions is largely responsible for the improvements in reef ecology and is a high priority for future management programs.","[McClanahan, Timothy R.; Muthiga, Nyawira A.] Marine Program, Wildlife Conservat Soc, Bronx, NY 10465 USA; [McClanahan, Timothy R.; Muthiga, Nyawira A.] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Marine Program, Mombasa, Kenya; [Kamukuru, Albogast T.] Univ Dar Es Salaam, Dept Aquat Sci & Fisheries, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Mwakalapa, Eliezer] Minist Livestock & Fisheries Dev, Mtwara, Tanzania; [Kalombo, Hassan] Reg Commissioners Off, Tanga, Tanzania",2,10.1371/journal.pone.0138769,2015

Using data from published species lists we categorize the reef fishes as either fished or non-fished based on their body size and reports from the published literature. Species diversity for both fished and non-fished groups decreases as the size of the local human population increases, and this relationship is stronger in species that are fished. Additionally, comparison of modern and museum collections show that modern reef communities have proportionally fewer fished species relative to 19th century ones.

The routes were implemented in two consecutive summer seasons and after each season, visual census techniques were used to describe flora composition and cover area (seaweeds and seagrasses) in order to understand patterns and evaluate human impacts. Snorkelers' opinions and perceptions about several issues related to the routes' environmental education role (e.g. role in enhancing biocliversity awareness) were investigated by questionnaire after the snorkelling activity. An inter-annual difference inflora assemblages was found, probably associated to natural variability, rather than snorkelers' impacts.

The annual patterns of spawning of four species of reef fish in the central Philippines (9.201355A degrees N, 123.327421A degrees E) were investigated over 11-22 months. On an annual basis, the study area experiences two windy monsoon seasons and two monsoon transition periods when winds are weaker. Protracted breeding seasons were evident, but the timing of inferred spawning peaks varied among species. Spawning peaks of Pterocaesio pisang (Caesionidae) coincided with the first monsoon transition period of the year (April-June) and the north-east monsoon (November-March). Caesio caerulaurea (Caesionidae) showed a spawning peak during the south-west monsoon (July-September) extending to the following monsoon transition period (October). In Naso minor (Acanthuridae), an annual pattern was difficult to discern due to insufficient data, but there was some suggestion of higher spawning activity during the north-east monsoon. Spawning in Pomacentrus moluccensis (Pomacentridae) was inferred to occur year-round except during the north-east monsoon. These results suggest that conditions favourable to the survival of pelagic larvae are not restricted to monsoon transition periods. Alternatively, the results indicate direct or indirect effects of temperature, rainfall, wind or wave action on the reproduction of adults.

This study examined the alternatives of top-down control of the benthos by parrotfish density and bottom-up control of parrotfish density by the benthos at four Philippine islands in a long-term (7.5-30 years) ""natural experiment"". No-take marine reserves (NTMRs) demonstrated that fishing reduced parrotfish density significantly at two islands (Sumilon, Mantigue), but not significantly at two other islands (Apo, Selinog). There was no evidence that cover of hard coral decreased, nor macroalgal cover increased, in fished areas relative to NTMRs, no evidence that parrotfish density affected hard coral cover significantly, and thus no evidence of top-down, fishing-induced benthic phase shifts at all four islands. There was, however, compelling evidence that benthos (cover of dead substrata and hard coral) exerted strong bottom-up control on parrotfish density. This bottom-up control was demonstrated most clearly by major environmental disturbances (e.g. typhoons, coral bleaching) that changed benthic habitat and, subsequently, parrotfish density. As hard coral cover declined (and cover of dead substratum increased), parrotfish density increased and vice versa. This response occurred in both major parrotfish feeding guilds (scrapers and excavators). This long-term study on heavily fished coral reefs suggests that the benthos drives the parrotfish, not the other way around. The paradigm of fishing-induced benthic phase shifts may not apply to all coral reefs at all times. Multiple drivers of benthic change on coral reefs should always be considered.","[Russ, Garry R.; Questel, Sarah-Lee A.; Rizzari, Justin R.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Russ, Garry R.; Questel, Sarah-Lee A.; Rizzari, Justin R.] Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Alcala, Angel C.] Silliman Univ, Angelo King Ctr Res & Environm Management, Dumaguete 6200, Philippines",29,10.1007/s00227-015-2728-3,2015

The current consensus is that this phenomenon results from enhanced production of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) that disrupt the symbiosis between corals and their endosymbiotic dinoflagellates, Symbiodinium. Here, the responses of two important antioxidant defence components, the host coenzyme Q (CoQ) and symbiont plastoquinone (PQ) pools, are investigated for the first time in colonies of the scleractinian coral, Acropora millepora, during experimentally-induced bleaching under ecologically relevant conditions. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to quantify the states of these two pools, together with physiological parameters assessing the general state of the symbiosis (including photosystem II photochemical efficiency, chlorophyll concentration and Symbiodinium cell densities). The results show that the responses of the two antioxidant systems occur on different timescales: (i) the redox state of the Symbiodinium PQ pool remained stable until twelve days into the experiment, after which there was an abrupt oxidative shift; (ii) by contrast, an oxidative shift of approximately 10% had occurred in the host CoQ pool after 6 days of thermal stress, prior to significant changes in any other physiological parameter measured. Host CoQ pool oxidation is thus an early biomarker of thermal stress in corals, and this antioxidant pool is likely to play a key role in quenching thermally-induced ROS in the coral-algal symbiosis. This study adds to a growing body of work that indicates host cellular responses may precede the bleaching process and symbiont dysfunction.","[Lutz, Adrian; Raina, Jean-Baptiste] James Cook Univ, AIMS JCU, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Lutz, Adrian; Raina, Jean-Baptiste; Motti, Cherie A.; van Oppen, Madeleine J.

Investigators of life history in vertebrates frequently focus on the impact of predation, but there is increasing evidence that predation may have unexpected impacts on population density that in turn prompt unexpected changes in life history. There are also other reasons why density might impact life history independently of predation or mortality more generally. We investigated the consequences of predation and density on life history variation among populations of the Pacific leaping blenny, Alticus arnoldorum. This fish from the island of Guam spends its adult life out of the water on rocks in the splash zone, where it is vulnerable to predation and can be expected to be sensitive to changes in population density that impact resource availability. We found populations invested more in reproduction as predation decreased, while growth rate varied primarily in response to population density. These differences in life history among populations are likely plastic given the extensive gene flow among populations revealed by a previous study. The influence of predation and density on life history was unlikely to have operated independently of each other, with predation rate tending to be associated with reduced population densities. Taken together, our results suggest predation and density can have complex influences on life history, and that plastic life history traits could allow populations to persist in new or rapidly changing environments.","[Ord, Terry J.] Univ New S Wales, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Kensington, NSW 2052, Australia; Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Kensington, NSW 2052, Australia",3,10.1371/journal.pone.0137244,2015

Yet, specialization is rarely quantified across several ecological niche axes and variables beyond the link between morphological and dietary specialization have received little attention. Here, we provide a quantitative evaluation of ecological specialization in a coral reef fish assemblage (f. Acanthuridae) along one fundamental and two realized niche axes. Specifically, we examined ecological specialization in 10 surgeonfish species with regards to morphology and two realized niche axes associated with diet and foraging microhabitat utilization using a recently developed multidimensional framework. We then investigated the potential relationships between morphological and behavioural specialization. These relationships differed markedly from the traditional ecomorphological paradigm. While morphological specialization showed no relationship with dietary specialization, it exhibited a strong relationship with foraging microhabitat specialization. However, this relationship was inverted: species with specialized morphologies were microhabitat generalists, whereas generalized morphotypes were microhabitat specialists. Interestingly, this mirrors relationships found in plant-pollinator communities and may also be applicable to other ecosystems, highlighting the potential importance of including niche axes beyond dietary specialization into ecomorphological frameworks. On coral reefs, it appears that morphotypes commonly perceived as most generalized may, in fact, be specialized in exploiting flat and easily accessible microhabitats.","[Brandl, Simon J.; Bellwood, David R.] ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Brandl, Simon J.; Robbins, William D.; Bellwood, David R.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Robbins, William D.] Wildlife Marine, Perth, WA, Australia",24,10.1098/rspb.2015.1147,2015

However, ecosystem responses to natural disturbances are rarely monitored both through space and time, while the factors promoting ecosystem stability act at various temporal and spatial scales. Hence, assessing both the spatial and temporal variations in species composition is important to comprehensively explore the effects of natural disturbances. Here, we suggest a framework to better scrutinize the mechanisms underlying community responses to disturbances through both time and space. Our analytical approach is based on beta diversity decomposition into two components, replacement and biomass difference. We illustrate this approach using a 9-year monitoring of coral reef fish communities off Moorea Island (French Polynesia), which encompassed two severe natural disturbances: a crown-of-thorns starfish outbreak and a hurricane. These disturbances triggered a fast logistic decline in coral cover, which suffered a 90% decrease on all reefs. However, we found that the coral reef fish composition remained largely stable through time and space whereas compensatory changes in biomass among species were responsible for most of the temporal fluctuations, as outlined by the overall high contribution of the replacement component to total beta diversity. This suggests that, despite the severity of the two disturbances, fish communities exhibited high resistance and the ability to reorganize their compositions to maintain the same level of total community biomass as before the disturbances. We further investigated the spatial congruence of this pattern and showed that temporal dynamics involved different species across sites; yet, herbivores controlling the proliferation of algae that compete with coral communities were consistently favored. These results suggest that compensatory changes in biomass among species and spatial heterogeneity in species responses can provide further insurance against natural disturbances in coral reef ecosystems by promoting high levels of key species (herbivores). They can also allow the ecosystem to recover more quickly.","[Lamy, Thomas; Claudet, Joachim] CNRS, CRIOBE USR CNRS EPHE UPVD 3278, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Lamy, Thomas; Chancerelle, Yannick; Siu, Gilles; Claudet, Joachim] Lab Excellence CORAIL, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Lamy, Thomas; Legendre, Pierre] Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Chancerelle, Yannick; Siu, Gilles] Ecole Prat Hautes Etud, CRIOBE USR CNRS EPHE UPVD 3278, Papetoai, Moorea, Fr Polynesia",19,10.1371/journal.pone.0138696,2015

While injection approaches are increasingly used in an attempt to control COTS densities, most of them display severe drawbacks including logistical challenges, high residual environmental impacts or low cost-effectiveness. We tested a new alternative control method based upon acidic injections of cheap, 100% natural products. We investigated the lethal doses, intra- and inter-specific disease transmission and immune responses of COTS when injected with fresh lime juice (extracted from local Citrus arantifolia) and white spirit vinegar. High COTS mortality was achieved with small volumes: 10-20 ml per seastar induced death in 89%/97% of injected specimens after an average 34.3 h/29.8 h for lime juice and vinegar respectively. Highest efficiency was reached for both solutions with double shots of (2 x 10 ml) in two different areas on the body: 100% mortality occurred within 12-24 h, which is similar or faster compared with other current injection methods. Multiple immune measures suggested that death was very likely caused by pH stress from the acidic solutions rather than a bacterial infection. Contagion to either conspecifics or a variety of other reef species was not observed, even at COTS densities 15 times higher than the highest naturally reported. 10 to 20 I lime juice/vinegar could kill up to a thousand COTS at a cost of less than 0.05 USD per specimen; no permits or special handling procedures are required. We conclude that injections of lime juice and vinegar offer great advantages when compared to current best practises and constitute a cheap and natural option for all reefs affected by COTS.","[Moutardier, Gregoire; Dumas, Pascal] IRD, UMR ENTROPIE 9220, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Moutardier, Gregoire; Gereva, Sompert; Ham, Jayven; Kaku, Rocky; Dumas, Pascal] Fisheries Dept Vanuatu, Port Vila, Vanuatu; [Mills, Suzanne C.; Adjeroud, Mehdi; Beldade, Ricardo; Dumas, Pascal] Lab Excellence Corail, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Mills, Suzanne C.; Beldade, Ricardo] UPVD, CRIOBE, USR 3278, CNRS,EPHE, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Beldade, Ricardo] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal; [Adjeroud, Mehdi] Univ Perpignan, IRD, UMR ENTROPIE 9220, F-66860 Perpignan, France",8,10.1371/journal.pone.0137605,2015

On Pacific coral reefs, predation by the crown-of-thorns sea star, Acanthaster planci, is associated with broad-scale losses of coral cover and increases of macroalgal cover. Macroalgal blooms increase coral macroalgal competition and can generate further coral decline. However, using a combination of manipulative field experiments and observations, we demonstrate that macroalgae, such as Sargassum polycystum, produce associational refuges for corals and dramatically reduce their consumption by Acanthaster. Thus, as Acanthaster densities increase, macroalgae can become coral mutualists, despite being competitors that significantly suppress coral growth. Field feeding experiments revealed that the protective effects of macroalgae were strong enough to cause Acanthaster to consume low-preference corals instead of high-preference corals surrounded by macroalgae. This highlights the context-dependent nature of coral-algal interactions when consumers are common. Macroalgal creation of associational refuges from Acanthaster predation may have important implications for the structure, function and resilience of reef communities subject to an increasing number of biotic disturbances.","[Hay, Mark E.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; Georgia Inst Technol, Aquat Chem Ecol Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",11,10.1098/rspb.2015.0714,2015

Crustaceans were present within the guts of 93 % of the 30 wrasse genera investigated. We found a distinct division between micro- and macro-crustacean predators: wrasses <80 mm standard length (SL) were predominantly micro-crustacean feeders, while wrasses >90 mm SL displayed a predominantly macro-Crustacea diet. Notably, micro-crustacean predators tended to specialise on certain crustacean taxa, whereas macro-crustacean predators consumed mostly brachyurans.

Generally, coral reefs shelter more invertebrate prey but also harbor more predators compared to vegetated areas. To avoid predation, many juvenile fish may select lower-risk vegetated areas rather than coral reefs. Very little information is known about habitat selection by juvenile fish if coral reefs have similar predation rates as vegetated areas. In this study, we quantified the density, diet, survival rate, and food availability of four reef fish species (Lethrinus harak, L. obsoletus, Lutjanus gibbus, and Parupeneus indicus) as well as predator and competitor density within a low-predation lagoon containing bare sand, coral reefs, and seagrass beds. The results showed that the two lethrinids used seagrass beds as primary habitats as small juveniles. Large juveniles of L. obsoletus (5 cm total length after dietary shift) and most juvenile L. gibbus preferred coral reefs. P. indicus were dietary generalists in most habitats. Overall, these instances of ontogenetic habitat selection may be related to variations in diet in each species. We also found that predation rates were extremely low (<30 %) in both coral and seagrass habitats and that coral reefs sheltered higher invertebrate prey densities (80 ind m(-2)) than did seagrass beds (30 ind m(-2)) and bare sand (<10 ind m(-2)). We hypothesized that competition is a factor potentially affecting habitat selection by juvenile reef fish, as more competitor fish inhabited coral reefs.

We investigate how changing the release interval affects the connectivity networks of three Caribbean species with low- to high-dispersal potential and swimming behavior.

In this study, we compare the ability of three simple metrics (average individual fish weight, fish density, and fish biomass) derived from the parrotfish assemblage and from an assemblage of highly valued commercial fish species to track changes in fishing pressure at spatial scales relevant to small Caribbean islands. Between June and August 2011, we conducted five consecutive visual fish surveys at six reefs <= 10 km apart along the west coast of Barbados, representing a spatial gradient in fishing pressure. We used these data to identify the fish metrics most strongly correlated with fishing pressure and describe their functional relationship with fishing pressure. Overall, average individual parrotfish weight and biomass and density of commercial fish species were the metrics most strongly correlated with fishing pressure, although for the latter two, such correlations depended on the range of fish body sizes analyzed. Fishing pressure accounted for most of the variability in all correlated fish metrics (R-adj(2) >= 0.75). However, functional relationships with fishing pressure differed qualitatively between metrics. In particular, average individual parrotfish weight was the metric most sensitive to incremental changes in fishing pressure.

Residency index to the study site ranged from 0.05 to 0.97, with a mean residency (+/- SD) of 0.57 +/- 0.26, but most individuals were detected at or near their tagging reef. Clear seasonal patterns were apparent, with fewer individuals detected between September and February. A large proportion of the tagged population (> 71 %) moved regularly between reefs. Silvertip sharks were detected less during daytime and exhibited a strong diel pattern in depth use, which may be a strategy for optimizing energetic budgets and foraging opportunities. This study provides the first detailed examination of the spatial ecology and behavior of silvertip sharks on coral reefs. Silvertip sharks remained resident at coral reef habitats over long periods, but our results also suggest this species may have more complex movement patterns and use larger areas of the GBR than common reef shark species. Our findings highlight the need to further understand the movement ecology of silvertip sharks at different spatial and temporal scales, which is critical for developing effective management approaches.","[Espinoza, Mario; Heupel, Michelle.

It feeds mainly on blood-sucking gnathiid isopods and also on the epidermal mucus of client fish; the nutritional quality of these foods, however, is unknown. The epidermal mucus of reef fish contains ultraviolet (UV)-absorbing compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids, MAAs), which are only obtained via the diet; nevertheless, while La. dimidiatus has high amounts of MAAs in its mucus, their source is unknown. Therefore, the energetic value (calories and protein estimated using carbon and nitrogen) and MAA level in gnathiids and mucus from several clients [parrotfishes, wrasses (Labridae), and a snapper (Lutjanidae)] were determined. The energetic value of mucus and gnathiids varied among fishes. Overall, carbon, nitrogen, calories, and protein per dry weight were higher in the mucus of most client species compared to gnathiids. Thus, depending on the client species, mucus may be energetically more advantageous for cleaner wrasse to feed on than gnathiids. UV absorbance, a confirmed proxy for MAA levels, indicated high MAA levels in mucus, whereas gnathiids had no detectable MAAs. This suggests that La. dimidiatus obtain MAAs from mucus but not from gnathiids. Hence, in addition to energy, the mucus of some clients also provides La. dimidiatus with the added bonus of UV-absorbing compounds. This may explain why cleaner fish prefer to feed on mucus over gnathiid isopods. The likely costs and benefits to clients of the removal of UV protecting mucus and parasitic gnathiids, respectively, and the variation in benefits gained by cleaner fish from feeding on these foods may explain some variation in cooperation levels in cleaning interactions.","[Eckes, Maxi; Dove, Sophie; Grutter, Alexandra S.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Dove, Sophie] Univ Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Siebeck, Ulrike E.] Univ Queensland, Sensory Neurobiol Grp, Sch Biomed Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Siebeck, Ulrike E.] Univ Queensland, Global Change Inst, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Siebeck, Ulrike E.] Univ Queensland, Visual Neuroethol Grp, SBMS, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia",9,10.1007/s00338-015-1313-z,2015

In this paper, I present in situ measurements of waves, currents, and turbulence to study the vertical structure of turbulence within a depression (curved channel) that is surrounded by coral reef colonies on a fringing reef in Hobihu, Nan-Wan Bay, southern Taiwan. Turbulence was measured using a dual-velocimetry technique, and wave bias contamination in the turbulence is controlled using ogive curve testing of the turbulent shear stress (TSS). The observed turbulent dissipation rate (epsilon) is approximately five times greater than simultaneous observations over the nearby sandy bottom site, which indicates stronger mixing within the coral reef than on sandy bottoms. The low ratio of the TSS to the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and sweeping events indicate that energetic momentum is transported downward into the depression of the coral reef canopies. The observed value of epsilon exceeds the shear production rate, which suggests that transport terms or other source terms might be important. Direct evaluation of the transport terms suggests that vertical turbulent transport and advection are significant mechanisms that diffuse and convect the TKE downward into the depression. The observed TSS can be described well by the Prandtl-von Karman eddy viscosity model and a two-equation turbulence model, which suggests that it is possible to develop a physically based model to quantify nutrient uptake and mass transfer in coral reefs under complex wave-current coastal flows.","Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Hydrol & Ocean Sci, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan",1,10.1007/s00338-015-1304-0,2015

It appears to have limited dispersal potential, but, paradoxically, it is widespread over much of the 2000 km of Mexican Pacific waters, suggesting mechanisms of long-distance dissemination. Despite its ecological importance, nothing is known about its patterns of genetic structure and connectivity in space and time. In this study, we assess levels of genetic structure and test the hypothesis of limited dispersal and isolation by distance among coral reef systems in the Mexican Pacific. Genetic diversity levels were consistently low in DNA sequences from two mitochondrial genes and one nuclear gene; however, they revealed strong and significant genetic differentiation throughout the study region. Patterns of genetic differentiation from the slow-evolving mitochondrial, but not the nuclear, genes were geographic scale dependent. We found higher mitochondrial genetic similarity among localities at 10-100s km than at larger scales (100-1000s km). However, all samples were genetically differentiated at the nuclear locus, which is inconsistent with frequent long-distance dispersal. Significant isolation by distance is consistent with life history traits shared by boring sponges: a short larval period and larval philopatric behavior. The patterns of genetic differentiation in C. vermifera concur with those found in other sympatric coral species, and suggest the influence of community-wide ecological and genetic mechanisms on the genetic makeup of coral reef species in the Mexican Pacific. Fixed genetic differences suggest that the southern population of Oaxaca may be experiencing incipient speciation.","[Leon-Pech, M.

Many species of cryptofauna have seemingly obligate associations with live coral and are therefore considered to be very vulnerable to coral mortality. Here we report the unanticipated prevalence of obligate coral-dwelling decapod crustaceans on dead colonies of branching corals in the Chagos Archipelago (British Indian Ocean Territory) in the central Indian Ocean. A total of 205 obligate coral-dwelling decapods, including Trapezia crabs, were recorded from 43 (out of 54) dead coral colonies of Acropora and Pocillopora collected across five different atolls. Trapezia individuals found on dead corals were mainly juveniles, and the few adults were almost exclusively male. Among the shrimps (Pontoniinae), however, it was predominantly adult females found on dead corals. Obligate coral-dwelling species that typically occur only on live Pocillopora hosts (e.g., Trapezia spp.) were recorded on dead Acropora. These findings suggests that these obligate coral-dwelling decapods are not simply persisting on coral hosts that have died, but may be explicitly recruiting to or moving to dead coral hosts at certain stages in their life cycle. Variation in the abundance of live coral among sites had no affect on the presence or abundance of obligate coral-dwelling decapods on dead corals. This study shows that habitat associations of obligate coral-dwelling organisms, and their reliance on different habitat types, are complex and further work is required to establish their vulnerability to widespread habitat degradation on coral reefs.","[Head, Catherine E.

A mesocosm experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of water acidification on a phytal meiofauna community from a coral reef. Community samples collected from the coral reef subtidal zone (Recife de Fora Municipal Marine Park, Porto Seguro, Bahia, Brazil), using artificial substrate units, were exposed to a control pH (ambient seawater) and to three levels of seawater acidification (pH reductions of 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 units below ambient) and collected after 15 and 30 d. After 30 d of exposure, major changes in the structure of the meiofauna community were observed in response to reduced pH. The major meiofauna groups showed divergent responses to acidification. Harpacticoida and Polychaeta densities did not show significant differences due to pH. Nematoda, Ostracoda, Turbellaria, and Tardigrada exhibited their highest densities in low-pH treatments (especially at the pH reduction of 0.6 units, pH 7.5), while harpacticoid nauplii were strongly negatively affected by low pH. This community-based mesocosm study supports previous suggestions that ocean acidification induces important changes in the structure of marine benthic communities. Considering the importance of meiofauna in the food web of coral reef ecosystems, the results presented here demonstrate that the trophic functioning of coral reefs is seriously threatened by ocean acidification.","[Sarmento, V.

Although many researchers have tested the impact of sedimentation on coral reef ecosystems in both the laboratory and the field and some have measured the impact of suspended sediment on the photosynthetic response of corals, there has yet to be a detailed investigation on how properties of the sediment itself can affect light availability for photosynthesis. We show that finer-grained and darker-colored sediment at higher suspended-sediment concentrations attenuates photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) significantly more than coarser, lighter-colored sediment at lower concentrations and provide PAR attenuation coefficients for various grain sizes, colors, and suspended-sediment concentrations that are needed for biophysical modeling. Because finer-grained sediment particles settle more slowly and are more susceptible to resuspension, they remain in the water column longer, thus causing greater net impact by reducing light essential for photosynthesis over a greater duration. This indicates that coral reef monitoring studies investigating sediment impacts should concentrate on measuring fine-grained lateritic and volcanic soils, as opposed to coarser-grained siliceous and carbonate sediment. Similarly, coastal restoration efforts and engineering solutions addressing long-term coral reef ecosystem health should focus on preferentially retaining those fine-grained soils rather than coarse silt and sand particles.","[Storlazzi, Curt D.; Norris, Ben K.; Rosenberger, Kurt J.] US Geol Survey, Pacific Coastal & Marine Sci Ctr, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA",29,10.1007/s00338-015-1268-0,2015

We present results from a high-resolution (sub-hourly to sub-daily) hydrodynamic and biogeochemical study, along with a coupled long-term (several months) hydrodynamic study, conducted on the back reefs of Ofu, American Samoa. During the high-resolution study, mean temperature was 29.0 degrees C with maximum temperatures near 32 degrees C. Dissolved oxygen concentrations spanned 32-178 % saturation, and pH(T) spanned the range from 7.80 to 8.39 with diel ranges reaching 0.58 units. Empirical cumulative distribution functions reveal that pH(T) was between 8.0 and 8.2 during only 30 % of the observational period, with approximately even distribution of the remaining 70 % of the time between pH(T) values less than 8.0 and greater than 8.2. Thermal and biogeochemical variability in the back reefs is partially controlled by tidal modulation of wave-driven flow, which isolates the back reefs at low tide and brings offshore water into the back reefs at high tide. The ratio of net community calcification to net community production was 0.15 +/- 0.01, indicating that metabolism on the back reef was dominated by primary production and respiration. Similar to other back reef systems, the back reefs of Ofu are carbon sinks during the daytime. Shallow back reefs like those in Ofu may provide insights for how coral communities respond to extreme temperatures and acidification and are deserving of continued attention.","[Koweek, David A.; Dunbar, Robert B.; Mucciarone, David A.] Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Monismith, Stephen G.; Woodson, C.

Here we performed advanced microbial taxonomies combined with both genome-based and classical approaches for new agarolytic vibrio isolates to describe not only a novel Vibrio species but also a member of a new Vibrio clade. Two novel vibrio strains (Vibrio astriarenae sp. nov. C7(T) and C20) showing agarolytic, halophilic and fermentative metabolic activity were isolated from a seawater sample collected in a coral reef in Okinawa. Intraspecific similarities of the isolates were identical in both sequences on the 16S rRNA and pyrH genes, but the closest relatives on the molecular phylogenetic trees on the basis of 16S rRNA and pyrH gene sequences were V. hangzhouensis JCM 15146(T) (97.8% similarity) and V. agarivorans CECT 5085(T) (97.3% similarity), respectively. Further multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) on the basis of 8 protein coding genes (ftsZ, gapA, gyrB, mreB, pyrH, recA, rpoA, and topA) obtained by the genome sequences clearly showed the V. astriarenae strain C7(T) and C20 formed a distinct new clade protruded next to V. agarivorans CECT 5085(T). The singleton V. agarivorans has never been included in previous MLSA of Vibrionaceae due to the lack of some gene sequences. Now the gene sequences are completed and analysis of 100 taxa in total provided a clear picture describing the association of V. agarivorans into pre-existing concatenated network tree and concluded its relationship to our vibrio strains. Experimental DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) data showed that the strains C7(T) and C20 were conspecific but were separated from all of the other Vibrio species related on the basis of both 16S rRNA and pyrH gene phylogenies (e.g., V. agarivorans CECT 5085(T), V. hangzhouensis JCM 15146(T) V. maritimus LMG 25439(T), and V. variabilis LMG 25438(T)). In silico DDH data also supported the genomic relationship.

Because of their bipartite life history, larvae of coastal species have to head back to the shore at the end of their pelagic episode, to settle. These settlement-stage larvae are known to display strong sensory and motile abilities, but most work has been focused on tropical, insular environments and on the influence of coast-related cues on orientation. In this study we quantified the in situ orientation behavior of settlement- stage larvae in a temperate region, with a continuous coast and a dominant along-shore current, and inspected both coast-dependent and independent cues. We tested six species: one Pomacentridae, Chromis chromis, and five Sparidae, Boops boops, Diplodus annularis, Oblada melanura, Spicara smaris and Spondyliosoma cantharus. Over 85% of larvae were highly capable of keeping a bearing, which is comparable to the orientation abilities of tropical species. Sun-related cues influenced the precision of bearing-keeping at individual level. Three species, out of the four tested in sufficient numbers, oriented significantly relative to the sun position.

Numerous species of Indo-pacific origin have colonized the Mediterranean in recent times, including tropical symbiont-bearing foraminifera. Among these is the species Pararotalia calcariformata. Unlike other invasive foraminifera, this species was discovered only two decades ago and is restricted to the eastern Mediterranean coast. Combining ecological, genetic and physiological observations, we attempt to explain the recent invasion of this species in the Mediterranean Sea. Using morphological and genetic data, we confirm the species attribution to P. calcariformata McCulloch 1977 and identify its symbionts as a consortium of diatom species dominated by Minutocellus polymorphus. We document photosynthetic activity of its endosymbionts using Pulse Amplitude Modulated Fluorometry and test the effects of elevated temperatures on growth rates of asexual offspring. The culturing of asexual offspring for 120 days shows a 30-day period of rapid growth followed by a period of slower growth. A subsequent 48-day temperature sensitivity experiment indicates a similar developmental pathway and high growth rate at 28 degrees C, whereas an almost complete inhibition of growth was observed at 20 degrees C and 35 degrees C. This indicates that the offspring of this species may have lower tolerance to cold temperatures than what would be expected for species native to the Mediterranean. We expand this hypothesis by applying a Species Distribution Model (SDM) based on modern occurrences in the Mediterranean using three environmental variables: irradiance, turbidity and yearly minimum temperature. The model reproduces the observed restricted distribution and indicates that the range of the species will drastically expand westwards under future global change scenarios. We conclude that P. calcariformata established a population in the Levant because of the recent warming in the region. In line with observations from other groups of organisms, our results indicate that continued warming of the eastern Mediterranean will facilitate the invasion of more tropical marine taxa into the Mediterranean, disturbing local biodiversity and ecosystem structure.","[Schmidt, Christiane; Morard, Raphael; Kucera, Michal] Univ Bremen, Ctr Marine Environm Sci, MARUM, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Almogi-Labin, Ahuva] Geol Survey Israel, IL-95501 Jerusalem, Israel; [Weinmann, Anna E.] Univ Georgia, Dept Geol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Weinmann, Anna E.] Univ Bonn, Steinmann Inst Geol Mineral & Paleontol, Bonn, Germany; [Titelboim, Danna; Abramovich, Sigal] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Geol & Environm Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel",15,10.1371/journal.pone.0132917,2015

However, it remains a challenge to explain what social complexity exactly is and what the best corresponding measures of brain anatomy are. Absolute and relative size of the brain and of the neocortex have often been used as a proxy to predict cognitive performance. Here, we apply the logic of the social brain hypothesis to marine cleaning mutualism involving the genus Labroides. These wrasses remove ectoparasites from 'client' reef fish. Conflict occurs as wrasse prefer client mucus over ectoparasites, where mucus feeding constitutes cheating. As a result of this conflict, cleaner wrasse show remarkable Machiavellian-like behaviour. Using own data as well as available data from the literature, we investigated whether the general brain anatomy of Labroides provides any indication that their Machiavellian behaviour is associated with a more complex brain. Neither data set provided evidence for an increased encephalisation index compared to other wrasse species. Published data on relative sizes of brain parts in 25 species of the order Perciformes suggests that only the diencephalon is relatively enlarged in Labroides dimidiatus. This part contains various nuclei of the social decision making network. In conclusion, gross brain anatomy yields little evidence for the hypothesis that strategic behaviour in cleaning selects for larger brains, while future research should focus on more detailed aspects like the sizes of specific nuclei as well as their cryoarchitectonic structure and connectivity.","[Chojnacka, Dominika; Barski, Jaroslaw Jerzy] Med Univ Silesia, Ctr Med Expt, PL-40752 Katowice, Poland; [Chojnacka, Dominika] Univ Wroclaw, Dept Zool, PL-50335 Wroclaw, Poland; [Isler, Karin] Univ Zurich, Anthropol Inst & Museum, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Barski, Jaroslaw Jerzy] Med Univ Silesia, Dept Physiol, PL-40752 Katowice, Poland; [Bshary, Redouan] Univ Neuchatel, Inst Biol, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland",4,10.1371/journal.pone.0135373,2015

The field of seascape genetics seeks to incorporate environmental variables and processes into analyses of population genetic data to improve our understanding of forces driving genetic divergence in the marine environment. Information about barriers to gene flow (such as ocean currents) is used to define a resistance surface to predict the spatial genetic structure of populations and explain deviations from the widely applied isolation-by-distance model. The majority of seascape approaches to date have been applied to linear coastal systems or at large spatial scales (more than 250 km), with very few applied to complex systems at regional spatial scales (less than 100 km). Here, we apply a seascape genetics approach to a peripheral population of the broadcast-spawning coral Acropora spicifera across the Houtman Abrolhos Islands, a high-latitude complex coral reef system off the central coast of Western Australia. We coupled population genetic data from a panel of microsatellite DNA markers with a biophysical dispersal model to test whether oceanographic processes could explain patterns of genetic divergence. We identified significant variation in allele frequencies over distances of less than 10 km, with significant differentiation occurring between adjacent sites but not between the most geographically distant ones. Recruitment probabilities between sites based on simulated larval dispersal were projected into a measure of resistance to connectivity that was significantly correlated with patterns of genetic divergence, demonstrating that patterns of spatial genetic structure are a function of restrictions to gene flow imposed by oceanographic currents. This study advances our understanding of the role of larval dispersal on the fine-scale genetic structure of coral populations across a complex island system and applies a methodological framework that can be tailored to suit a variety of marine organisms with a range of life-history characteristics.","[Thomas, Luke; Kendrick, Gary A.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, UWA Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Kennington, W.

However, the mechanisms by which dissolved inorganic nutrients, and especially nitrogen forms (ammonium versus nitrate) can disturb the association between corals and their symbiotic algae are subject to controversial debate. Here, we investigated the coral response to varying N:P ratios, with nitrate or ammonium as a nitrogen source. We showed significant differences in the carbon acquisition by the symbionts and its allocation within the symbiosis according to nutrient abundance, type and stoichiometry. In particular, under low phosphate concentration (0.05 mu M), a 3 mu M nitrate enrichment induced a significant decrease in carbon fixation rate and low values of carbon translocation, compared with control conditions (N : P = 0.5 : 0.05), while these processes were significantly enhanced when nitrate was replaced by ammonium. A combined enrichment in ammonium and phosphorus (N: P = 3 : 1) induced a shift in nutrient allocation to the symbionts, at the detriment of the host. Altogether, these results shed light into the effect of nutrient enrichment on reef corals. More broadly, they improve our understanding of the consequences of nutrient loading on reef ecosystems, which is urgently required to refine risk management strategies.","[Ezzat, Leila; Grover, Renaud; Ferrier-Pages, Christine] Ctr Sci Monaco, Marine Dept, MC-98000 Monaco, Monaco; [Maguer, Jean-Francois] Univ Inst Europeen Mer, LEMAR, UMR UBO CNRS IRD 6539, F-29280 Plouzane, France",16,10.1098/rspb.2015.0610,2015

In response, place-based strategies involve communities and resource users in management have proliferated. Here, we present a transferable community-based approach to assess the social and ecological factors affecting resource sustainability and food security in a small-scale, coral reef fishery. Our results show that this small-scale fishery provides large-scale benefits to communities, including 7,353 +/- 1547 kg yr(-1) (mean +/- SE) of seafood per year, equating to >30,000 meals with an economic value of $78,432. The vast majority of the catch is used for subsistence, contributing to community food security: 58% is kept, 33.5% is given away, and 8.5% is sold. Our spatial analysis assesses the geographic distribution of community beneficiaries from the fishery (the ""food shed"" for the fishery), and we document that 20% of seafood procured from the fishery is used for sociocultural events that are important for social cohesion. This approach provides a method for assessing social, economic, and cultural values provided by small-scale food systems, as well as important contributions to food security, with significant implications for conservation and management. This interdisciplinary effort aims to demonstrate a transferable participatory research approach useful for resource-dependent communities as they cope with socioeconomic, cultural, and environmental change.","[Kittinger, John N.; Teneva, Lida T.] Conservat Int, Betty & Gordon Moore Ctr Sci & Oceans, Honolulu, HI 96825 USA; [Kittinger, John N.; Kittinger, Daniela S.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Ocean Solut, Stanford Woods Inst Environm, Monterey, CA USA; [Koike, Haruko; Stamoulis, Kostantinos A.; Friedlander, Alan M.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Biol, Fisheries Ecol Res Lab, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Oleson, Kirsten L.

Although previously viewed as a reflex reaction controlled by the autonomic nervous system, the escape responses of individuals when repeatedly startled are highly variable in their characteristics, suggesting some behavioural mediation of the response. Previous studies have shown that fishes are able to learn from past experiences, but few studies have assessed how past experience with predators affect the fast-start response. Here we determined whether prior experience with the smell or sight of a predator (the Dottyback, Pseudochromis fuscus) affected the escape response of juveniles of the Spiny Chromis (Acanthochromis polyacanthus). Results show that individuals exposed to any of the predator cues prior to being startled exhibited a stronger escape response (i.e., reduced latency, increased escape distance, mean response speed, maximum response speed and maximum acceleration) when compared with controls. This study demonstrates the plasticity of escape responses and highlights the potential for naive reef fish to take into account both visual and olfactory threat cues simultaneously to optimise the amplitude of their kinematic responses to perceived risk.","[Ramasamy, Ryan A.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",12,10.1371/journal.pone.0132790,2015

Here, we test the patterns reported in previous studies by examining population structure over a range of spatial scales in Forsterygion lapillum and at regional scales in F. capito using microsatellites. Samples were collected between 2000 and 2009, and between 35A degrees 56'S and 46A degrees 36'S. The microsatellite findings differ from previous mtDNA results in several key respects. First, there is no support for a genetically distinct population at Banks Peninsula, as was seen with mtDNA. Second, in contrast to mtDNA, the two triplefin species exhibited very similar patterns of population structuring at regional scales (10(2)-10(3) km), suggesting that year-round spawning only in F. lapillum does not have a significant effect on population connectivity. Third, while there is evidence of isolation by distance in both species, there are no clear phylogeographic breaks, and far less structure is evident than in the mtDNA data. Further, we found a lack of structure over local scales in F. lapillum, suggesting extensive gene flow over tens of kilometres. Our findings suggest a pattern of stepping-stone dispersal and contiguous gene flow, sometimes over large distances, supporting the hypothesis that factors other than geographic isolation, such as ecological speciation with gene flow, have been important in the evolution of this group.","[Rabone, M.; Lavery, S.

In European waters the most extensive reefs are found at depths of 300 - 500 m on the continental margin. In Norwegian waters many of these reefs are located in areas of interest for oil and gas exploration and production. In this study drilling was carried out in the Morvin drill field in proximity to a number of small Lophelia pertusa coral reefs (closest reefs 100 m upstream and 350 m downstream of point of waste drill material release). In a novel monitoring study, ROV video surveys of 9 reefs were conducted prior, during, immediately after and > 1 year after drilling operations. Behavior of coral polyps inhabiting reefs exposed to differing concentrations of drill cuttings and drilling fluids (waste drilling material) were compared. Levels of expected exposure to these waste materials were determined for each reef by modelling drill cutting transport following release, using accurate in-situ hydrodynamic data collected during the drilling period and drill cutting discharge data as parameters of a dispersal model. The presence / absence of associate reef species (Acesta excavata, Paragorgia arborea and Primnoa resedaeformis) were also determined from each survey video. There were no significant differences in Lophelia pertusa polyp behavior in corals modelled to have been exposed to pulses of > 25 ppm drill cutting material and those modelled to be exposed to negligible concentrations of material. From the video data collected, there were no observed degradations of reef structure over time, nor reductions of associate fauna abundance, regardless of modelled exposure concentration at any of the surveyed reefs. This study focused exclusively on adult fauna, and did not assess the potential hazard posed by waste drilling material to coral or other larvae. Video data was collected by various ROV's, using different camera and lighting setups throughout the survey campaign, making comparison of observations prior, during and post drilling problematic. A standardization of video monitoring in future monitoring campaigns is recommended.","Jacobs Univ Bremen, Oceanlab, D-28759 Bremen, Germany",11,10.1371/journal.pone.0134076,2015

Although tourism is an important economic vehicle for the host country, its continued growth has led to on-going concerns about its environmental sustainability. Coastal and marine tourism can directly affect the environment through direct and indirect tourist activities. For these reasons tourism sector needs practical actions of sustainability. Several studies have shown how education minimizes the impact on and is proactive for, preserving the natural resources. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of a citizen science program to improve the environmental education of the volunteers, by means of questionnaires provided to participants to a volunteer-based Red Sea coral reef monitoring program (STEproject). Fifteen multiple-choice questions evaluated the level of knowledge on the basic coral reef biology and ecology and the awareness on the impact of human behaviour on the environment. Volunteers filled in questionnaires twice, once at the beginning, before being involved in the project and again at the end of their stay, after several days participation in the program. We found that the participation in STEproject significantly increased both the knowledge of coral reef biology and ecology and the awareness of human behavioural impacts on the environment, but was more effective on the former. We also detected that tourists with a higher education level have a higher initial level of environmental education than less educated people and that the project was more effective on divers than snorkelers.

Coral reefs can be divided in continental (i.e., reefs that develop on the continental shelf, including siliciclastic reefs) and oceanic (i.e., far off the continental shelf, usually on volcanic substratum); whether or not these habitat differences impose community-wide ecological divergence or species exclusion/coexistence with evolutionary consequences, is unknown. Methods Studying Caribbean octocorals as model system, we determined the phylogenetic community structure in a coral reef community, making emphasis on species coexistence evidenced on trait evolution and environmental feedbacks. Forty-nine species represented in five families constituted the species pool from which a phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using mtDNA. We included data from 11 localities in the Western Caribbean (Colombia) including most reef types. To test diversity-environment and phenotype-environment relationships, phylogenetic community structure and trait evolution we carried out comparative analyses implementing ecological and evolutionary approaches. Results Phylogenetic inferences suggest clustering of oceanic reefs (e.g., atolls) contrasting with phylogenetic overdispersion of continental reefs (e.g., reefs banks). Additionally, atolls and barrier reefs had the highest species diversity (Shannon index) whereas phylogenetic diversity was higher in reef banks. The discriminant component analysis supported this differentiation between oceanic and continental reefs, where continental octocoral species tend to have greater calyx apertures, thicker branches, prominent calyces and azooxanthellate species. This analysis also indicated a clear separation between the slope and the remaining habitats, caused by the presence or absence of Symbiodinium. K statistic analysis showed that this trait is conserved as well as the branch shape. Discussion There was strong octocoral community structure with opposite diversity and composition patterns between oceanic and continental reefs. Even habitats with similar depths and overall environmental conditions did not share similar communities between oceanic and continental reefs. This indicates a strong regional influence over the local communities, probably due to water transparency differences between major reef types, i.e., oceanic vs. continental shelf-neritic. This was supported by contrasting patterns found in morphology, composition and evolutionary history of the species between atolls and reef banks.","[Velasquez, Johanna; Sanchez, Juan A.] Univ Los Andes, Fac Ciencias, Lab Biol Mol Marina BIOMMAR, Dept Ciencias Biol, Bogota 111711, Colombia",4,10.1371/journal.pone.0129609,2015

On coral reefs, macroalgal outbreaks are one of the most widely documented signs of degradation. This study simulated local-scale degradation on a healthy coral reef to determine how resident taxa, with the potential to reverse algal outbreaks, respond. We utilized a combination of acoustic and video monitoring to quantify changes in the movements and densities, respectively, of coral reef herbivores following a simulated algal outbreak. We found an unprecedented accumulation of functionally important herbivorous taxa in response to algal increases. Herbivore densities increased by 267% where algae were present. The increase in herbivore densities was driven primarily by an accumulation of the browsing taxa Naso unicornis and Kyphosus vaigiensis, two species which are known to be important in removing macroalgae and which may be capable of reversing algal outbreaks. However, resident individuals at the site of algal increase exhibited no change in their movements. Instead, analysis of the size classes of the responding individuals indicates that large functionally-important nonresident individuals changed their movement patterns to move in and feed on the algae. This suggests that local-scale reef processes may not be sufficient to mitigate the effects of local degradation and highlights the importance of mobile links and cross-scale interactions.","[Welsh, Justin Q.] MSci Pty Ltd, Perth, WA, Australia; [Welsh, Justin Q.; Bellwood, David R.] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Welsh, Justin Q.; Bellwood, David R.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",5,10.1371/journal.pone.0132895,2015

Likewise, projections for many subsistence fisheries in the tropics indicate a dramatic decline is looming in the coming decades. In the Pacific Islands coastal fisheries provide basic subsistence needs for millions of people. A decline in fish catch would therefore have profound impacts on the health and livelihoods of these coastal communities. Given the decrease in local catch rates reported for many coastal communities in the Pacific, it is important to understand if fishers have responded to ecological change (either by expanding their fishing range and/or increasing their fishing effort), and if so, to evaluate the costs or benefits of these responses. We compare data from fish catches in 1995 and 2011 from a rural coastal community in Solomon Islands to examine the potentially changing coastal reef fishery at these time points. In particular we found changes in preferred fishing locations, fishing methodology and catch composition between these data sets. The results indicate that despite changes in catch rates (catch per unit effort) between data collected in 2011 and 16 years previously, the study community was able to increase gross catches through visiting fishing sites further away, diversifying fishing methods and targeting pelagic species through trolling. Such insight into local-scale responses to changing resources and/or fisheries development will help scientists and policy makers throughout the Pacific region in managing the region's fisheries in the future.","[Albert, Simon; Fisher, Paul L.] Univ Queensland, Sch Civil Engn, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Aswani, Shankar] Rhodes Univ, Dept Anthropol, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa; [Aswani, Shankar] Rhodes Univ, Dept Ichthyol & Fisheries Sci, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa; [Albert, Joelle] WorldFish, Honiara, Solomon Islands",14,10.1371/journal.pone.0130800,2015

Ocean acidification may also impair an organism's ability to process environmental and biological cues. These counteracting impacts make it challenging to predict how acidification will alter species interactions and community structure. To examine effects of acidification on consumptive and behavioural interactions between mud crabs (Panopeus herbstii) and oysters (Crassostrea virginica), oysters were reared with and without caged crabs for 71 days at three pCO(2) levels. During subsequent predation trials, acidification reduced prey consumption, handling time and duration of unsuccessful predation attempt. These negative effects of ocean acidification on crab foraging behaviour more than offset any benefit to crabs resulting from a reduction in the net rate of oyster calcification.

Sampling included different reef locations (fringing, intermediate and barrier reef), different associated ecosystems (mangroves and seagrass beds) and rivers. In total, 30 taxa of macrophytes, plus pools of particulate and sedimentary OM (POM and SOM) were sampled. Isotopic signatures (C and N) of each OM sources was characterized and the composition of OM pools assessed. In addition, spatial and seasonal variations of reef OM sources were examined. Mangroves isotopic signatures were the most C-depleted (-30.17 +/- 0.41 parts per thousand) and seagrass signatures were the most C-enriched (-4.36 +/- 0.72 parts per thousand). Trichodesmium spp. had the most N-depleted signatures (-0.14 +/- 0.03 parts per thousand) whereas mangroves had the most N-enriched signatures (6.47 +/- 0.41 parts per thousand). The composition of POM and SOM varied along a coast-to-barrier reef gradient. River POM and marine POM contributed equally to coastal POM, whereas marine POM represented 90% of the POM on barrier reefs, compared to 10% river POM. The relative importance of river POM, marine POM and mangroves to the SOM pool decreased from fringing to barrier reefs. Conversely, the relative importance of seagrass, Trichodesmium spp. and macroalgae increased along this gradient. Overall, spatial fluctuations in POM and SOM were much greater than in primary producers. Seasonal fluctuations were low for all OM sources. Our results demonstrated that a large variety of OM sources sustain coral reefs, varying in their origin, composition and role and suggest that delta C-13 was a more useful fingerprint than delta N-15 in this endeavour. This study also suggested substantial OM exchanges and trophic connections between coral reefs and surrounding ecosystems.

The activities required to harness the full potential of an EAFM as an adaptation to climate change and ocean acidification are also described, including: provision of the necessary expertise to inform all stakeholders about the risks to fish habitats, fish stocks and catches due to climate change; promotion of trans-disciplinary collaboration; facilitating the participation of all key stakeholders; monitoring the wider fisheries system for climate impacts; and enhancing resources and capacity to implement an EAFM. By channeling some of the resources available to the Asia-Pacific region to adapt to climate change into an EAFM, developing countries will not only build resilience to the ecological and fisheries effects of climate change, they will also help address the habitat degradation and overfishing presently reducing the productivity of coastal fisheries.

In this study, algal assemblages, in the presence and absence of farming Pomacentrus wardi were exposed to two combinations of SW temperature and pCO2 levels projected for the austral spring of 2100 (the B1 ""reduced"" and the A1FI ""business-as-usual"" CO2 emission scenarios) at Heron Island (GBR, Australia). These assemblages were dominated by the presence of red algae and non-epiphytic cyanobacteria, i.e. cyanobacteria that grow attached to the substrate rather than on filamentous algae. The endpoint algal composition was mostly controlled by the presence/absence of farming damselfish, despite a large variability found between the algal assemblages of individual fish. Different scenarios appeared to be responsible for a mild, species specific change in community composition, observable in some brown and green algae, but only in the absence of farming fish. Farming fish appeared unaffected by the conditions to which they were exposed. Algal biomass reductions were found under ""reduced"" CO2 emission, but not ""business-as-usual"" scenarios. This suggests that action taken to limit CO2 emissions may, if the majority of algae behave similarly across all seasons, reduce the potential for phase shifts that lead to algal dominated communities. At the same time the availability of food resources to damselfish and other herbivores would be smaller under ""reduced"" emission scenarios.","[Bender, Dorothea; Kline, David; Diaz-Pulido, Guillermo; Dove, Sophie] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Bender, Dorothea; Kline, David; Diaz-Pulido, Guillermo; Dove, Sophie] Univ Queensland, Global Change Inst, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Bender, Dorothea; Diaz-Pulido, Guillermo; Dove, Sophie] Univ Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Champ, Connor Michael] Univ Queensland, Queensland Brain Inst, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Diaz-Pulido, Guillermo] Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Diaz-Pulido, Guillermo] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",5,10.1371/journal.pone.0131442,2015

Levins's loop analysis was used as a methodological framework for assessing the local stability (considered as a component of sustainability) of the modeled management interventions represented by various scenarios. The results provided by models of different complexity (models 1 through 4) showed that a reduction of coral species cover would drive the system to unstable states. In the absence of the alien lionfish, the simultaneous fishing of large benthic epifaunal species, adult herbivorous fish and adult carnivorous fish could be sustainable only if the coral species present high levels of cover (models 2 and 3). Once the lionfish is added to the simulations (models 4 and 5), the analysis suggests that although the exploitation or removal of lionfish from shallow waters may be locally stable, it remains necessary to implement additional and concurrent human interventions that increase the holistic sustainability of the control strategy. The supplementary interventions would require the implementation of programs for: (1) the restoration of corals for increasing their cover, (2) the exploitation or removal of lionfish from deeper waters (decreasing the chance of source/sink meta-population dynamics) and (3) the implementation of bans and re-stocking programs for carnivorous fishes (such as grouper) that increase the predation and competition pressure on lionfish (i.e. biological control). An effective control management for the alien lionfish at Chinchorro bank should not be optimized for a single action plan: instead, we should investigate the concurrent implementation of multiple strategies.","[Ortiz, Marco] Univ Antofagasta, Fac Recursos Mar, Inst Antofagasta, Inst Invest Oceanol, Antofagasta, Chile; [Rodriguez-Zaragoza, Fabin] Univ Guadalajara, Lab Ecosistemas Marinos & Acuicultura, Dept Ecol, Ctr Univ Ciencias Biol & Agr, Zapopan 45110, Jalisco, Mexico; [Hermosillo-Nunez, Brenda] Univ Antofagasta, Programa Doctorado Ciencias Aplicadas, Menc Sistemas Marinos Costeros, Fac Recursos Mar, Antofagasta, Chile; [Jordan, Ferenc] Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Ecol Res, Budapest, Hungary; [Jordan, Ferenc] Microsoft Res COSBI, Rovereto, Italy",2,10.1371/journal.pone.0130261,2015

We found that representatives of many scleractinian species are brightly fluorescent at depths of 50-60 m at the Interuniversity Institute for Marine Sciences (IUI) reef in Eilat, Israel. Some of these fluorescent species have distribution maxima at mesophotic depths (40-100 m). Several individuals from these depths displayed yellow or orange-red fluorescence, the latter being essentially absent in corals from the shallowest parts of this reef. We demonstrate experimentally that in some cases the production of fluorescent pigments is independent of the exposure to light; while in others, the fluorescence signature is altered or lost when the animals are kept in darkness. Furthermore, we show that green-to-red photoconversion of fluorescent pigments mediated by short-wavelength light can occur also at depths where ultraviolet wavelengths are absent from the underwater light field. Intraspecific colour polymorphisms regarding the colour of the tissue fluorescence, common among shallow water corals, were also observed for mesophotic species. Our results suggest that fluorescent pigments in mesophotic reefs fulfil a distinct biological function and offer promising application potential for coral-reef monitoring and biomedical imaging.","[Eyal, Gal; Grinblat, Mila; Ben-Zvi, Or; Loya, Yossi] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Eyal, Gal; Shaked, Yonathan; Tamir, Raz] Interuniv Inst Marine Sci Eilat, Elat, Israel; [Wiedenmann, Joerg; D'Angelo, Cecilia] Univ Southampton, Coral Reef Lab, NOCS, Southampton, Hants, England; [Wiedenmann, Joerg] Univ Southampton, Inst Life Sci IFLS, Southampton, Hants, England; [Kramarsky-Winter, Esti] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Biotechnol Engn, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Treibitz, Tali] Univ Haifa, Charney Sch Marine Sci, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel; [Smith, Tyler B.] Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, St Thomas, VI USA; [Harii, Saki] Univ Ryukyus, Motobu, Okinawa, Japan; [Denis, Vianney] Acad Sinica, Biodivers Res Ctr, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Noyes, Tim] Bermuda Inst Ocean Sci, St Georges, Bermuda; [Tamir, Raz] Bar Ilan Univ, Fac Life Sci, Ramat Gan, Israel",20,10.1371/journal.pone.0128697,2015

While this premise is generally accepted, management interventions are complicated because the contributions from individual stressors are difficult to distinguish. The present study examined the extent to which fishing pressure and pollution predicted progress towards the Micronesia Challenge, an international conservation strategy initiated by the political leaders of 6 nations to conserve at least 30% of marine resources by 2020. The analyses were rooted in a defined measure of coral-reef-ecosystem condition, comprised of biological metrics that described functional processes on coral reefs. We report that only 42% of the major reef habitats exceeded the ecosystem-condition threshold established by the Micronesia Challenge. Fishing pressure acting alone on outer reefs, or in combination with pollution in some lagoons, best predicted both the decline and variance in ecosystem condition. High variances among ecosystem-condition scores reflected the large gaps between the best and worst reefs, and suggested that the current scores were unlikely to remain stable through time because of low redundancy. Accounting for the presence of marine protected area (MPA) networks in statistical models did little to improve the models' predictive capabilities, suggesting limited efficacy of MPAs when grouped together across the region. Yet, localized benefits of MPAs existed and are expected to increase over time. Sensitivity analyses suggested that (i) grazing by large herbivores, (ii) high functional diversity of herbivores, and (iii) high predator biomass were most sensitive to fishing pressure, and were required for high ecosystem-condition scores. Linking comprehensive fisheries management policies with these sensitive metrics, and targeting the management of pollution, will strengthen the Micronesia Challenge and preserve ecosystem services that coral reefs provide to societies in the face of climate change.","[Houk, Peter; Camacho, Rodney; McLean, Matthew] Univ Guam, Marine Lab, UOG Stn, Mangilao, GU 96923 USA; [Maxin, Selino; Anson, Jorg; Joseph, Eugene] Conservat Soc Pohnpei, Kolonia, Pohnpei State, Micronesia; [Nedlic, Osamu; Luckymis, Marston] Kosrae Conservat & Safety Org, Lelu, Kosrae State, Micronesia; [Adams, Katrina] Kosrae Village Resort, Malem, Kosrae State, Micronesia; [Hess, Don] Coll Marshall Isl, Majuro, Marshall Island; [Kabua, Emma] Marshall Islands Marine Resources Author, Majuro, Marshall Island; [Yalon, Anthony; Buthung, Eva] Yap Community Act Program, Colonia, Yap State, Micronesia; [Graham, Curtis] Chuuk Marine Resources Dept, Weno, Yap State, Micronesia; [Taylor, Brett] James Cook Univ, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [van Woesik, Robert] Florida Inst Technol, Dept Biol Sci, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA",17,10.1371/journal.pone.0130823,2015

However, escalating stressful conditions enable some symbionts to thrive as opportunists. We present evidence that a stress-tolerant ""zooxanthella"" from the Indo-Pacific Ocean, Symbiodinium trenchii, has rapidly spread to coral communities across the Greater Caribbean. In marked contrast to populations from the Indo-Pacific, Atlantic populations of S. trenchii contained exceptionally low genetic diversity, including several widespread and genetically similar clones. Colonies with this symbiont tolerate temperatures 1-2 degrees C higher than other host-symbiont combinations; however, calcification by hosts harboring S. trenchii is reduced by nearly half, compared with those harboring natives, and suggests that these new symbioses are maladapted. Unforeseen opportunism and geographical expansion by invasive mutualistic microbes could profoundly influence the response of reef coral symbioses to major environmental perturbations but may ultimately compromise ecosystem stability and function.","[Pettay, D.

Increasing sea surface temperatures and thermal stress create environmental limits at low latitudes, and decreasing aragonite saturation state creates environmental limits at high latitudes. This study examines the response of unique coral reef habitats to climate change in the remote Pacific, using the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Earth System Model version 1 alongside the species distribution algorithm Maxent. Narrow ranges of physicochemical variables are used to define unique coral habitats and their performance is tested in future climate scenarios. General loss of coral reef habitat is expected in future climate scenarios and has been shown in previous studies. This study found exactly that for most of the predominant physico-chemical environments. However, certain coral reef habitats considered marginal today at high latitude, along the equator and in the eastern tropical Pacific were found to be quite robust in climate change scenarios. Furthermore, an environmental coral reef refuge previously identified in the central south Pacific near French Polynesia was further reinforced. Studying the response of specific habitats showed that the prevailing conditions of this refuge during the 20th century shift to a new set of conditions, more characteristic of higher latitude coral reefs in the 20th century, in future climate scenarios projected to 2100.","Naval Res Lab, Remote Sensing Div, Washington, DC 20375 USA",8,10.1371/journal.pone.0128875,2015

Diel ranges in temperature and carbonate chemistry parameters coupled with seasonal changes in the mean conditions define periods during the year when a reef habitat is exposed to anomalous thermal and/or pH exposure. Anomalous conditions are defined as values that exceed an empirically estimated threshold for each variable. We present a 200-day time series from June through December 2010 of carbonate chemistry and environmental parameters measured on the Heron Island reef flat. These data reveal that aragonite saturation state, pH, and pCO(2) were primarily modulated by biologically-driven changes in dissolved organic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA), rather than salinity and temperature. The largest diel temperature ranges occurred in austral spring, in October (1.5 - 6.6 degrees C) and lowest diel ranges (0.9 - 3.2 degrees C) were observed in July, at the peak of winter. We observed large diel total pH variability, with a maximum range of 7.7 - 8.5 total pH units, with minimum diel average pH values occurring during spring and maximum during fall. As with many other reefs, the nighttime pH minima on the reef flat were far lower than pH values predicted for the open ocean by 2100. DIC and TA both increased from June (end of Fall) to December (end of Spring). Using this high-resolution dataset, we developed exposure metrics of pH and temperature individually for intensity, duration, and severity of low pH and high temperature events, as well as a combined metric. Periods of anomalous temperature and pH exposure were asynchronous on the Heron Island reef flat, which underlines the importance of understanding the dynamics of co-occurrence of multiple stressors on coastal ecosystems.","[Kline, David I.; Mitchell, Brian Gregory] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Integrat Oceanog Div, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Kline, David I.; Dove, Sophie; Hoegh-Guldberg, Ove] Univ Queensland, Global Change Inst, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Kline, David I.; Miard, Thomas; Chai, Aaron; Dove, Sophie; Hoegh-Guldberg, Ove] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Coral Reef Ecosyst Lab, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Dove, Sophie; Hoegh-Guldberg, Ove] Univ Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Teneva, Lida; Schneider, Kenneth; Dunbar, Rob] Stanford Univ, Environm Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Teneva, Lida] Conservat Int, Betty & Gordon Moore Ctr Sci & Oceans, Honolulu, HI 96825 USA; [Schneider, Kenneth; Caldeira, Ken] Carnegie Inst, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA USA; [Hauri, Claudine] Univ Hawaii, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Hauri, Claudine] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Sch Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Inst Marine Sci, Fairbanks, AK USA; [Miard, Thomas] Inst Oceanog Paul Ricard, F-83140 Ile Des Embiez Le Brusc, Six Fours Les P, France; [Marker, Malcolm] Univ Queensland, Fac Engn Architecture & Informat Technol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Lazar, Boaz; Rivlin, Tanya] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, H Steinitz Marine Biol Lab, Interuniv Inst Marine Sci, Elat, Israel",23,10.1371/journal.pone.0127648,2015

Often trade-offs involve noneconomic and difficult-to-evaluate values, such as cultural identity, employment, the well-being of poor people, or particular species or ecosystem structures. Although trade-offs need to be considered for successful environmental management, they are often overlooked in favor of win-wins. Management and policy decisions demand approaches that can explicitly acknowledge and evaluate diverse trade-offs. We identified a diversity of apparent trade-offs in a small-scale tropical fishery when ecological simulations were integrated with participatory assessments of social-ecological system structure and stakeholders' well-being. Despite an apparent win-win between conservation and profitability at the aggregate scale, food production, employment, and well-being of marginalized stakeholders were differentially influenced by management decisions leading to trade-offs. Some of these trade-offs were suggested to be ""taboo"" trade-offs between morally incommensurable values, such as between profits and the well-being of marginalized women. These were not previously recognized as management issues. Stakeholders explored and deliberated over trade-offs supported by an interactive ""toy model"" representing key system trade-offs, alongside qualitative narrative scenarios of the future. The concept of taboo trade-offs suggests that psychological bias and social sensitivity may exclude key issues from decision making, which can result in policies that are difficult to implement. Our participatory modeling and scenarios approach has the potential to increase awareness of such trade-offs, promote discussion of what is acceptable, and potentially identify and reduce obstacles to management compliance.","[Daw, Tim M.; Galafassi, Diego; Peterson, Garry D.] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Daw, Tim M.] Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Coulthard, Sarah] Northumbria Univ, Dept Social Sci & Languages, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England; [Cheung, William W.

Investments are required to (1) identify the locations where FADs are likely to make the greatest contributions to the food security of rural (coastal) communities, and yield good catches near urban centres; (2) integrate the use of FADs with other livelihood options available to rural communities and remove any blockages preventing such communities from harnessing the full range of benefits from FADs; (3) assess whether exclusion zones for industrial fishing provide adequate access to tuna for small-scale-fishers; (4) determine if small-scale fishers are able to catch sufficient tuna to meet the protein needs of rural communities; (5) evaluate whether FADs add value to coral reef management initiatives; and (6) improve the design and placement of nearshore FADs.

Estimating these limits is a critical prerequisite for understanding the impacts of climate change on the biogeography of coral reefs. Here we used the diagnostic model ReefHab to determine the current environmental tolerance limits for coral reefs and the global distribution of potential coral reef habitats as a function of six factors: temperature, salinity, nitrate, phosphate, aragonite saturation state, and light. To determine these tolerance limits, we extracted maximum and minimum values of all environmental variables in corresponding locations where coral reefs are present. We found that the global, annually averaged tolerance limits for coral reefs are 21.7-29.6 degrees C for temperature, 28.7-40.4 psu for salinity, 4.51 mu mol L-1 for nitrate, 0.63 mu mol L-1 for phosphate, and 2.82 for aragonite saturation state. The averaged minimum light intensity in coral reefs is 450 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1). The global area of potential reef habitats calculated by the model is 330.5 x 10(3) km(2). Compared with previous studies, the tolerance limits for temperature, salinity, and nutrients have not changed much, whereas the minimum value of aragonite saturation in coral reef waters has decreased from 3.28 to 2.82. The potential reef habitat area calculated with ReefHab is about 121x10(3) km(2) larger than the area estimated from the charted reefs, suggesting that the growth potential of coral reefs is higher than currently observed.","[Guan, Yi; Hohn, Soenke; Merico, Agostino] Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Ecol, Syst Ecol, Bremen, Germany; [Merico, Agostino] Jacobs Univ Bremen, D-28759 Bremen, Germany",6,10.1371/journal.pone.0128831,2015

Purple urchins were less dense and more cryptic inside a local marine protected area (MPA) that contained high predator abundance than in nearby heavily fished areas, whereas red urchins rarely were found outside the MPA. Urchin proportional mortality was inversely density dependent during the day when sheephead were active, despite fish aggregations in plots of high urchin density, but was density independent during the night when lobsters were active. Urchin mortality was reduced under understory algal cover during the day, but not during the night. Examining whether urchin mortality from predation is density dependent and how habitat complexity influences this relationship is imperative because behavioral changes and increases in urchin populations can have vast ecological and economic consequences in kelp forest communities.","[Nichols, Kathryn D.; Hovel, Kevin A.] San Diego State, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Segui, Leah] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",4,10.1007/s00227-015-2664-2,2015

Over the past 15 yr, studies of larval dispersal in coral reef fishes have generated accumulating evidence of consistently high levels of self-recruitment and local retention at various spatial scales. These findings have, to a certain degree, created a paradigm shift toward the perception that large fractions of locally produced recruitment may be the rule rather than the exception. Here we examined the degree of localized settlement in an anemonefish, Amphiprion bicinctus, at a solitary coral reef in the central Red Sea by integrating estimates of self-recruitment obtained from genetic parentage analysis with predictions of local retention derived from a biophysical dispersal model parameterized with real-time physical forcing. Self-recruitment at the reef scale (c. 0.7 km(2)) was virtually absent during two consecutive January spawning events (1.4 % in 2012 and 0 % in 2013). Predicted levels of local retention at the reef scale varied temporally, but were comparatively low for both simulations (7 % in 2012 and 0 % in 2013). At the same time, the spatial scale of simulated dispersal was restricted to approximately 20 km from the source. Model predictions of reef-scale larval retention were highly dependent on biological parameters, underlining the need for further empirical validations of larval traits over a range of species. Overall, our findings present an urgent caution when assuming the potential for self-replenishment in small marine reserves.","[Nanninga, G. B.; Saenz-Agudelo, P.; Berumen, M.

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and microsatellite DNA (msatDNA) markers were used to estimate historic and contemporary gene flow to determine the level of population self-replenishment and to measure genetic and genotypic diversity among all four locations in the species range (south-west Pacific Ocean)-Middleton Reef (MR), Elizabeth Reef (ER), Lord Howe Island (LHI) and Norfolk Island (NI). MPAs exist at MR and LHI and are limited or non-existent at ER and NI, respectively. There was no obvious differentiation in mtDNA among locations, however, msatDNA revealed differentiation between the most peripheral (NI) and all remaining locations (MR, ER and LHI). Despite high mtDNA connectivity (M = 259-1,144), msatDNA connectivity was limited (M = 3-9) with high self-replenishment (68-93 %) at all locations. NI is the least connected and heavily reliant on self-replenishment, and the absence of MPAs at NI needs to be rectified to ensure the persistence of endemic species at this location. Other endemic fishes exhibit similar patterns of high self-replenishment across the four locations, indicating that a single spatial management approach consisting of a MPA network protecting part of each location could provide reasonable protection for these species. Thus, the existing network of MPAs at this endemic hotspot appears adequate at some locations, but not at all.","[van der Meer, M.

We re-assessed broad-scale population connectivity with a focus on the 18 coral reef hot spots in the Intra-American Seas described in Roberts (Science 278:1454-1457, 1997), by including seasonal and inter-annual variability in potential larval dispersal. While overall dispersal patterns were in agreement with previous findings, further statistical analyses show that dispersal patterns driven by mean circulation initially described by Roberts (Science 278:1454-1457, 1997) can significantly underestimate particle connectivity envelopes. The results from this study indicate that seasonal and inter-annual variability in circulation are crucial in modulating both dispersal distance and directional anisotropy of virtual larvae over most coral reef sites and that certain larval hotspots are likely more strongly connected than originally thought. Improved larval dispersal transport envelopes can enhance the accuracy of probability estimates which, in turn, may help to explain episodic larval settlement in certain times and places, and guide spatial management such as marine protected areas.","[Qian, H.; Li, Y.; He, R.; Eggleston, D.

Mapping of the coral reef at Darwin, herein Wellington Reef, shows it presently to be the largest known structural reef in the Galapagos. It consists of numerous 1- to 3-m-high Porites framework towers or stacks and overlies a carbonate (coral/calcareous sediments) basement. Pre-disturbance Wellington Reef was constructed chiefly by Porites lobata and Pocillopora elegans, and Wenman coral cover was dominated by Pavona clavus and Porites lobata. Subsequent surveys in 2012 have demonstrated robust recovery in spite of ENSO thermal shock events, involving both high and low stressful temperatures that have caused tissue bleaching and mortality. No losses of coral species have been observed. Radiocarbon dating of 1- to 3-m-high poritid framework stacks, from their peaks to bases, revealed modern ages of up to 690 yr. Incremental stack growth rates ranged from 0.15-0.39 to 1.04-2.40 cm yr(-1). The former are equivalent to framework accretion rates of 1.5-3.9 m Kyr(-1), the latter to coral skeletal growth rates of 1.0-2.4 cm yr(-1). Coral recovery in the central and southern Galapagos has been nonexistent to low compared with the northern islands, due chiefly to much higher population densities and destructive grazing pressure of the echinoid Eucidaris galapagensis. Thus, coral reef resistance to ENSO perturbations and recovery potential in the Galapagos are influenced by echinoid bioerosion that varies significantly among islands.","[Glynn, Peter W.] Univ Miami, Dept Marine Biol & Ecol, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Riegl, Bernhard; Purkis, Samuel; Kerr, Jeremy M.] Nova SE Univ, Oceanog Ctr, Natl Coral Reef Inst, Dania, FL 33004 USA; [Smith, Tyler B.] Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, St Thomas, VI 00802 USA",28,10.1007/s00338-015-1280-4,2015

Octocorals deposit high-magnesium calcite in their skeletons, and according to different models, they could be more susceptible to the depletion of carbonate ions than either calcite or aragonite-depositing organisms. This study investigated the response of the gorgonian coral Eunicea fusca to a range of CO2 concentrations from 285 to 4,568 ppm (pH range 8.1-7.1) over a 4-week period. Gorgonian growth and calcification were measured at each level of CO2 as linear extension rate and percent change in buoyant weight and calcein incorporation in individual sclerites, respectively. There was a significant negative relationship for calcification and CO2 concentration that was well explained by a linear model regression analysis for both buoyant weight and calcein staining. In general, growth and calcification did not stop in any of the concentrations of pCO(2); however, some of the octocoral fragments experienced negative calcification at undersaturated levels of calcium carbonate (> 4,500 ppm) suggesting possible dissolution effects. These results highlight the susceptibility of the gorgonian coral E. fusca to elevated levels of carbon dioxide but suggest that E. fusca could still survive well in mid-term ocean acidification conditions expected by the end of this century, which provides important information on the effects of ocean acidification on the dynamics of coral reef communities. Gorgonian corals can be expected to diversify and thrive in the Atlantic-Eastern Pacific; as scleractinian corals decline, it is likely to expect a shift in these reef communities from scleractinian coral dominated to octocoral/soft coral dominated under a ""business as usual"" scenario of CO2 emissions.","[Gomez, C.

Of particular concern have been temperature, ultraviolet radiation, and photosynthetically available radiation. Satellite observation systems allow synoptic-scale monitoring of coral environments that can be used to investigate the effects of such environmental parameters. Recent advancements in algorithm development for new satellite data products have made it possible to include light availability in such monitoring. Long-term satellite data (2000-2013), in combination with in situ bleaching surveys (N = 3,334; spanning 2003-2012), were used to identify the environmental factors contributing to bleaching of Florida reef tract corals. Stepwise multiple linear regression supports the conclusion that elevated sea surface temperature (SST; partial R (adj) (2) = 0.13; p < 0.001) and high visible light levels reaching the benthos (partial R (adj) (2) = 0.06; p < 0.001) each independently contributed to coral bleaching. The effect of SST was modulated by significant interactions with wind speed (partial R (adj) (2) = 0.03; p < 0.001) and ultraviolet benthic available light (partial R (adj) (2) = 0.01; p = 0.022). These relationships were combined via canonical analysis of principal coordinates to create a predictive model of coral reef bleaching for the region. This model predicted 'severe bleaching' and 'no bleaching' conditions with 69 and 57 % classification success, respectively. This was approximately 2.5 times greater than that predicted by chance and shows improvement over similar models created using only temperature data. The results enhance the understanding of the factors contributing to coral bleaching and allow for weekly assessment of historical and current bleaching stress.","[Barnes, Brian B.; Hallock, Pamela; Hu, Chuanmin; Muller-Karger, Frank] Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA; [Palandro, David] ExxonMobil Upstream Res Co, Houston, TX USA; [Walter, Cory] Mote Marine Lab, Trop Res Lab, Summerland, FL USA; [Zepp, Richard] US EPA, Natl Exposure Res Lab, Athens, GA USA",6,10.1007/s00338-015-1258-2,2015

The distribution of the affected species would then display a distinct pattern, with survivorship increasing at greater distance from the conspecific adult (negative density dependence), leaving a vacant area around the adult where other species can survive. The giant barrel sponge, Xestospongia muta, is an abundant and long-lived sponge on Caribbean coral reefs that is actively grazed by sponge-eating fishes and is susceptible to disease. We tested the Janzen-Connell hypothesis on barrel sponges on Conch Reef, Florida, by examining their distribution as a function of size using spatial point pattern analyses. Clark and Evans tests and a series of Ripley's K function analyses revealed no consistent distribution pattern, with most analyses resulting in a random pattern of sponge distribution. While predation by sponge-eating fishes has recently been discovered to structure sponge communities on reefs across the Caribbean, these top-down effects do not translate to spatial distributions of X. muta that support Janzen-Connell predictions.","[Deignan, Lindsey K.; Pawlik, Joseph R.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol & Marine Biol, Ctr Marine Sci, Wilmington, NC 28409 USA",2,10.1007/s00338-014-1255-x,2015

The Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA) includes extensive submerged reefs that do not approach sea level and are within depths that support many coral reef taxa that also occur in shallow water. However, the composition of benthic communities on submerged reefs in the GBRWHA is virtually unknown. We examined spatial patterns in benthic community composition on 13 submerged reefs in the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR) at depths of 10-30 m. We show that benthic communities on submerged reefs include similar species groups to those on neighbouring emergent reefs. The spatial distribution of species groups was well explained by depth and cross-shelf gradients that are well-known determinants of community composition on emergent reefs. Many equivalent species groups occurred at greater depths on submerged reefs, likely due to variability in the hydrodynamic environment among reef morphologies. Hard coral cover and species richness were lowest at the shallowest depth (6 m) on emergent reefs and were consistently higher on submerged reefs for any given depth. These results suggest that disturbances are less frequent on submerged reefs, but evidence that a severe tropical cyclone in 2011 caused significant damage to shallow regions of more exposed submerged reefs demonstrates that they are not immune. Our results confirm that submerged reefs in the central GBR support extensive and diverse coral assemblages that deserve greater attention in ecosystem assessments and management decisions.","[Roberts, T.

Crustose coralline algae (CCA) are important contributors to reef calcium carbonate and can facilitate coral recruitment. Despite the importance of CCA, little is known about species-level distribution, abundance, and diversity, and how these vary across the continental shelf and key habitat zones within the GBR. We quantified CCA species distributions using line transects (n = 127) at 17 sites in the northern and central regions of the GBR, distributed among inner-, mid-, and outer-shelf regions. At each site, we identified CCA along replicate transects in three habitat zones: reef flat, reef crest, and reef slope. Taxonomically, CCA species are challenging to identify (especially in the field), and there is considerable disagreement in approach. We used published, anatomically based taxonomic schemes for consistent identification. We identified 30 CCA species among 12 genera; the most abundant species were Porolithon onkodes, Paragoniolithon conicum (sensu Adey), Neogoniolithon fosliei, and Hydrolithon reinboldii. Significant cross-shelf differences were observed in CCA community structure and CCA abundance, with inner-shelf reefs exhibiting lower CCA abundance than outer-shelf reefs. Shelf position, habitat zone, latitude, depth, and the interaction of shelf position and habitat were all significantly associated with variation in composition of CCA communities. Collectively, shelf position, habitat, and their interaction contributed to 22.6 % of the variation in coralline communities. Compared to mid- and outer-shelf sites, inner-shelf sites exhibited lower relative abundances of N. fosliei and Lithophyllum species. Reef crest habitats exhibited greater abundance of N. fosliei than reef flat and reef slope habitats. Reef slope habitats exhibited lower abundance of P. onkodes, but greater abundance of Neogoniolithon clavycymosum than reef crest and reef slope habitats. These findings provide important data on CCA distribution within the GBR and reinforce the fundamental role of cross-shelf variation and diverse habitat zones as contributors to the biodiversity of the GBR.","[Dean, Angela J.; Tager, Danika; Pandolfi, John M.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Marine Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Dean, Angela J.] Univ Queensland, Queensland Brain Inst, CoralWatch, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Steneck, Robert S.] Univ Maine, Darling Marine Ctr, Sch Marine Sci, Walpole, ME 04573 USA; [Pandolfi, John M.] Univ Queensland, ARC, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Pandolfi, John M.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia",13,10.1007/s00338-015-1263-5,2015

We used assays of six common macroalgae (Acanthophora spicifera, Caulerpa taxifolia, Galaxaura rugosa, Laurencia sp. Sargassum sp., and Turbinaria ornata) and remote underwater video cameras to quantify herbivory in two habitats (reef crest and slope) across multiple sites on Orpheus Island, Great Barrier Reef. Rates of herbivory varied among macroalgal taxa, habitats, and sites. Reductions in algal biomass were greatest for Sargassum sp. (36 % 4 h(-1)), intermediate for A. spicifera, Laurencia sp., C. taxifolia, and T. ornata (17-33 % 4 h(-1)) and lowest for G. rugosa (6 % 4 h(-1)). Overall, rates of herbivory were generally greater on the reef crest (30 % 4 h(-1)) than the reef slope (21 % 4 h(-1)). This difference in rates of herbivory coincided with a marked shift in the dominant herbivores between habitats. Kyphosus vaigiensis, despite only feeding on three species of macroalgae (Sargassum sp., T. ornata, and A. spicifera), was responsible for 34 % of all bites recorded on the reef crest yet did not take a single bite from algae on the reef slope. In contrast, Siganus doliatus took bites on every species of algae in both habitats, accounting for 40 % of bites on the reef crest and 74 % of all bites recorded on the reef slope. This difference in the number of macroalgal species targeted by herbivores and the habitat/s in which they feed adds another dimension of complexity to our understanding of coral reef herbivore dynamics.","[Loffler, Zoe; Bellwood, David R.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Bellwood, David R.; Hoey, Andrew S.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",10,10.1007/s00338-015-1265-3,2015

Baseline grazing assays using algae collected on a fringing reef in Moorea, French Polynesia, revealed that herbivore preferences among three common species ranked Padina boryana > Sargassum mangarevense a parts per thousand << Amansia rhodantha. Comparing grazing preferences between individual thalli of the same species collected < 15 m apart revealed that consumption of intertidal S. mangarevense was nearly six times greater than for conspecifics collected from the adjacent subtidal reef flat. The same trend occurred for P. boryana but was not significant. This demonstrated that algal palatability can vary on a very small spatial scale, presenting a potential trap for the unwary when setting up experiments; we encourage researchers to consider this potential complication in experimental studies of herbivory.","[Keeley, Kathryn N.; Stroh, Jolie D.; Tran, Diem Samantha C.; Fong, Peggy] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Fong, Caitlin R.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",4,10.1007/s00338-015-1274-2,2015

Based on multiple regression analysis, we tested the contribution of several attributes (colony height, width, and area, fractal dimension as a measure of colony complexity, lacunarity as a measure of the heterogeneity, and ""colonial"" epibiont cover) to abundance and taxonomic richness of associated assemblages. The results highlight the variation in the response of epifaunal assemblages to the gorgonian colony characteristics. The nature and intensity of the relationships were gorgonian species-dependent and varied from one taxonomic group to another. For both gorgonian species analyzed, the strongest predictor of species richness and abundance of the epifaunal assemblages was ""colonial"" epibiont cover, possibly due to a trophic effect (direct or indirect enhancement of food availability) combined with the surface available for colonization (species-area effect). Although structural complexity is usually indicated as the main driver for rich and abundant coral-associated assemblages, no significant relationship was observed between fractal dimension and the community descriptors; lacunarity, which reflects the sizes of the inter-branch spaces, was only linked to taxonomic richness in the assemblages associated with Leptogorgia lusitanica. The validity of the paradigm that structural complexity enhances biodiversity may be scale-dependent. In the case of gorgonians, the effect of complexity at the ""garden"" level may be more relevant than at the individual colony level.

This is particularly relevant for defining what factors are driving the presence, location, and movements of individuals. The long-term movement and space use patterns of grey reef sharks, Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, were examined on a whole of reef scale in the southern Great Barrier Reef to define whether movement and activity space varied through time. Twenty-nine C. amblyrhynchos were tracked for over 2 years to define movement patterns. All individuals showed high residency within the study site, but also had high roaming indices. This indicated that individuals remained in the region and used all of the monitored habitat (i.e., the entire reef perimeter). Use of space was consistent through time with high reuse of areas most of the year. Therefore, individuals maintained discrete home ranges, but undertook broader movements around the reef at times. Mature males showed greatest variation in movement with larger activity spaces and movement into new regions during the mating season (August-September). Depth use patterns also differed, suggesting behaviour or resource requirements varied between sexes. Examination of the long-term, reef-scale movements of C. amblyrhynchos has revealed that reproductive activity may play a key role in space use and activity patterns. It was unclear whether mating behaviour or an increased need for food to sustain reproductive activity and development played a greater role in these patterns. Reef shark movement patterns are becoming more clearly defined, but research is still required to fully understand the biological drivers for the observed patterns.","[Heupel, M.

There are two principle explanations for this behaviour: avoidance of predation or avoidance of solar irradiance. This study sought supporting evidence to distinguish between these two explanations by examining the usage of tabular structures on a shallow mid-shelf reef of the Great Barrier Reef at midday and sunset. If predation avoidance is most important, usage should increase towards sunset; conversely, if avoidance of solar radiation is most important, more fishes should use cover at midday. Underwater video observations revealed that tabular structures were extensively used by large reef fishes at midday, being characterised by numerous species, especially Lutjanidae and Haemulidae. In contrast, at sunset, tabular structures were used by significantly fewer large reef fishes, being characterised mostly by species of unicornfish (Naso spp.). Resident times of fishes using tabular structures were also significantly longer at midday (28:06 +/- A 5:55 min) than at sunset (07:47 +/- A 2:19 min). The results suggest that the primary function of tabular structures for large reef fishes is the avoidance of solar irradiance. This suggestion is supported by the position of fishes when sheltering. The majority of large reef fishes were found to shelter under the lip of tabular structure, facing outwards. This behaviour is thought to allow protection from harmful downwelling UV-B irradiance while allowing the fish to retain photopic vision and survey more of the surrounding area. These findings help to explain the importance of tabular structures for large reef fishes on coral reefs, potentially providing a valuable energetic refuge from solar irradiance.","[Kerry, J.

Taxonomic assignment of 16S ribosomal RNA tag sequences estimated altogether 26 microbial groups, represented by bacterial (75.5%) and archaeal (22%) domains.

The Crenarchaeota microbes detected in three Atlantic Ocean sponges had a close similarity with Crenarchaeota from geographically separated subtidal Red Sea sponges. Our study showed that most of the microbial communities observed in sponges (73%) were also found in the surrounding ambient seawater suggesting possible environmental acquisition and/or horizontal transfer of microbes. Beyond the microbial diversity and community structure assessments (NMDS, ADONIS, ANOSIM), we explored the interactions between the microbial communities coexisting in sponges using the checkerboard score (C-score). Analyses of the microbial association pattern (co-occurrence) among intertidal sympatric sponges revealed the random association of microbes, favoring the hypothesis that the sponge-in-habiting microbes are recruited from the habitat mostly by chance or influenced by environmental factors to benefit the hosts.","[Alex, Anoop; Antunes, Agostinho] Univ Porto, Interdisciplinary Ctr Marine & Environm Res, CIIMAR CIMAR, P-4050123 Oporto, Portugal; [Alex, Anoop; Antunes, Agostinho] Univ Porto, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, P-4169007 Oporto, Portugal",15,10.1371/journal.pone.0127455,2015

Although corals in Singapore persist in one the world's most anthropogenically impacted reef systems, our understanding of the role of coral settlement in the persistence of coral communities in Singapore remains limited. Spatial and temporal patterns of coral settlement were examined at 7 sites in the southern islands of Singapore, using settlement tiles deployed and collected every 3 months from 2011 to 2013. Settlement occurred year round, but varied significantly across time and space. Annual coral settlement was low (similar to 54.72 spat m(-2) yr(-1)) relative to other equatorial regions, but there was evidence of temporal variation in settlement rates. Peak settlement occurred between March-May and September-November, coinciding with annual coral spawning periods (March-April and October), while the lowest settlement occurred from December-February during the northeast monsoon. A period of high settlement was also observed between June and August in the first year (2011/12), possibly due to some species spawning outside predicted spawning periods, larvae settling from other locations or extended larval settlement competency periods. Settlement rates varied significantly among sites, but spatial variation was relatively consistent between years, suggesting the strong effects of local coral assemblages or environmental conditions. Pocilloporidae were the most abundant coral spat (83.6%), while Poritidae comprised only 6% of the spat, and Acroporidae <1%. Other, unidentifiable families represented 10% of the coral spat. These results indicate that current settlement patterns are reinforcing the local adult assemblage structure ('others'; i.e. sediment-tolerant coral taxa) in Singapore, but that the replenishment capacity of Singapore's reefs appears relatively constrained, which could lead to less resilient reefs.","[Bauman, Andrew G.; Guest, James R.; Steinberg, Peter D.] Nanyang Technol Univ, Nanyang Environm & Water Res Inst, Adv Environm Biotechnol Ctr, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Guest, James R.; Steinberg, Peter D.] Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Guest, James R.; Steinberg, Peter D.] Univ New S Wales, Ctr Marine Bioinnovat, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Dunshea, Glenn] Ecol Marine Serv, Burnett Heads, Qld, Australia; [Low, Jeffery] Natl Pk Board, Natl Biodivers Ctr, Singapore, Singapore; [Todd, Peter A.] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, Expt Marine Ecol Lab, Singapore 117548, Singapore",15,10.1371/journal.pone.0127874,2015

Coral reefs support upwards of one third of all marine species of fish, so the loss of coral habitat may have substantial consequences to local fish diversity. We posit that the effects of habitat degradation will be most severe in coral regions with highest biodiversity of fishes due to greater specialization by fishes for particular coral habitats. Our novel approach to this important but untested hypothesis was to conduct the same field experiment at three geographic locations across the Indo-Pacific biodiversity gradient (Papua New Guinea; Great Barrier Reef, Australia; French Polynesia). Specifically, we experimentally explored whether the response of local fish communities to identical changes in diversity of habitat-providing corals was independent of the size of the regional species pool of fishes. We found that the proportional reduction (sensitivity) in fish biodiversity to loss of coral diversity was greater for regions with larger background species pools, reflecting variation in the degree of habitat specialization of fishes across the Indo-Pacific diversity gradient. This result implies that habitat-associated fish in diversity hotspots are at greater risk of local extinction to a given loss of habitat diversity compared to regions with lower species richness. This mechanism, related to the positive relationship between habitat specialization and regional biodiversity, and the elevated extinction risk this poses for biodiversity hotspots, may apply to species in other types of ecosystems.","[Holbrook, Sally J.; Schmitt, Russell J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Holbrook, Sally J.; Schmitt, Russell J.; Brooks, Andrew J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Coastal Res Ctr, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Messmer, Vanessa; Srinivasan, Maya; Munday, Philip L.; Jones, Geoffrey P.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Australian Res Council, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Srinivasan, Maya; Munday, Philip L.; Jones, Geoffrey P.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",12,10.1371/journal.pone.0124054,2015

However, the endosymbiotic phase within Symbiodinium life history is inherently tied to a more cryptic free-living (ex hospite) phase that remains largely unexplored. Here we show that free-living Symbiodinium spp. in culture commonly form calcifying bacterial-algal communities that produce aragonitic spherulites and encase the dinoflagellates as endolithic cells. This process is driven by Symbiodinium photosynthesis but occurs only in partnership with bacteria. Our findings not only place dinoflagellates on the map of microbial-algal organomineralization processes but also point toward an endolithic phase in the Symbiodinium life history, a phenomenon that may provide new perspectives on the biology and ecology of Symbiodinium spp. and the evolutionary history of the coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis.","[Frommlet, Joerg C.; Sousa, Maria L.; Alves, Artur; Serodio, Joao] Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Frommlet, Joerg C.; Sousa, Maria L.; Alves, Artur; Serodio, Joao] Univ Aveiro, Ctr Environm & Marine Studies CESAM, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Vieira, Sandra I.] Univ Aveiro, Autonomous Sect Hlth Sci, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Vieira, Sandra I.] Univ Aveiro, Ctr Cell Biol, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Vieira, Sandra I.] Univ Aveiro, Inst Biomed, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Suggett, David J.] Univ Technol Sydney, Funct Plant Biol & Climate Change Cluster, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",8,10.1073/pnas.1420991112,2015

Here, we report for the first time the bacterial diversity of two cohabiting sponges, viz. Cinachyra cavernosa and Haliclona pigmentifera, as well as that in the ambient water from the coral reef ecosystems of the Gulf of Mannar, located along the southeast coast of India. Two hundred and fifty two clones in the 16S rRNA gene library of these sponges were grouped into eight distinct phyla, of which four belonged to the core group that are associated only with sponges. Phylogenetic analysis of the core bacteria showed close affinity to other sponge-associated bacteria from different geographical locations. gamma-Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes and Deferribacter were the core groups in C. cavernosa while beta and delta-Proteobacteria performed this role in H. pigmentifera. We observed greater OTU diversity for C. cavernosa (H-I 2.07) compared to H. pigmentifera (H-I 1.97). UniFrac analysis confirmed the difference in bacterial diversity of the two sponge species and also between the sponges and the reef water (p<0.001).

However, reserves designed to rebuild profits in the long-term may cause short-term losses-a serious issue in regions where fisheries are key for food security. We examine the tension between the long-term benefits of reserves and short-term losses, using a multispecies model of coral reef fisheries. Reserves designed to maximize long-term profits caused significant short-term losses. We model several policy solutions, where we incrementally increased either: the number of months per year that the reserve is closed to fishing; the size of the reserve; or the number species protected within the reserve. Protecting species sequentially, starting with the most valued species, provided the best outcome in the short-term with the most rapid recovery of profits. Solving the dilemma of meeting short-and long-term goals will ultimately improve the effectiveness of marine reserves for managing fisheries and conserving ecosystems.","[Brown, Christopher J.] Univ Queensland, Global Change Inst, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Brown, Christopher J.; Abdullah, Sabah; Mumby, Peter J.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia",13,10.1111/conl.12124,2015

Here, we explore interactions between sampling effort, sampling design, and the presence of spatial genetic structure (SGS) on the ability to effectively characterize genetic diversity on a coral reef. To do this, we take our dataset of 2352 genotypes (78 unique multi-locus genotypes) of the coral, Pocillopora damicornis, collected from June 2007 to October 2009, a dataset of near-exhaustive sampling of a single patch reef in KAne'ohe Bay, Hawai'i (21A degrees 27.462N, 157A degrees 48.405W), and subsample from it using three different strategies: (1) random sampling from throughout the reef; (2) saturation sampling all corals from within a pre-defined area of the reef, avoiding the reef's edge; and (3) sampling all nearest neighbors of a randomly chosen coral while allowing for the inclusion of the reef's edge. Our results demonstrate appreciable variation (e.g., 0.35-0.46) in estimates of observed heterozygosity (H (O)) using a typical sample size of 50 and that in the presence of SGS, non-random sampling schemes can give biased estimates of genetic diversity. Furthermore, our results indicate that over 1000 samples (i.e., similar to 40 % of the total number of colonies) are required to reveal the true pattern of spatial genetic structure at our site. We also demonstrate by rarefaction analysis that the bias in estimating clonal richness (i.e., the proportion of unique genotypes in a given sampling area relative to the total number of samples surveyed) for small sample numbers is due to the predominance of clones (i.e., high level of clonality) and not skew in genet frequency distribution. Overall, we argue that: (1) consideration of sampling design is important in population genetic studies, particularly since non-random sampling in the presence of SGS can give biased estimates of genetic diversity and (2) intense to near-exhaustive sampling schemes may be important for characterizing genetic diversity in highly clonal populations.","[Gorospe, Kelvin D.; Donahue, Megan J.; Karl, Stephen A.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA",4,10.1007/s00227-015-2634-8,2015

Such transitions can occur either smoothly or in an abrupt and catastrophic fashion. Important examples of the latter can be found in ecology, climate sciences, and economics, to name a few, where regime shifts have catastrophic consequences that are mostly irreversible (e.g., desertification, coral reef collapses, and market crashes). Predicting and preventing these abrupt transitions remains a challenging and important task. Usually, simple deterministic equations are used to model and rationalize these complex situations. However, stochastic effects might have a profound effect. Here we use 1D and 2D spatially explicit models to show that intrinsic (demographic) stochasticity can alter deterministic predictions dramatically, especially in the presence of other realistic features such as limited mobility or spatial heterogeneity. In particular, these ingredients can alter the possibility of catastrophic shifts by giving rise to much smoother and easily reversible continuous ones. The ideas presented here can help further understand catastrophic shifts and contribute to the discussion about the possibility of preventing such shifts to minimize their disruptive ecological, economic, and societal consequences.","[Martin, Paula Villa; Munoz, Miguel A.] Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Electmagnetismo & Fis Mat, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Bonachela, Juan A.; Levin, Simon A.] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Munoz, Miguel A.] Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Inst Carlos Fis Teor & Computac, E-18071 Granada, Spain",35,10.1073/pnas.1414708112,2015

The consequences of this trend for reef-associated communities are currently unclear, but expected to be profound. Here, we assess whether changes in fish assemblages have been non-random over several decades of declining reef structure. More specifically, we predicted that species that depend exclusively on coral reef habitat (i.e., habitat specialists) should be at a disadvantage compared to those that use a broader array of habitats (i.e., habitat generalists). Analysing 3727 abundance trends of 161 Caribbean reef-fishes, surveyed between 1980 and 2006, we found that the trends of habitat-generalists and habitat-specialists differed markedly. The abundance of specialists started to decline in the mid-1980s, reaching a low of similar to 60% of the 1980 baseline by the mid-1990s. Both the average and the variation in abundance of specialists have increased since the early 2000s, although the average is still well below the baseline level of 1980. This modest recovery occurred despite no clear evidence of a regional recovery in coral reef habitat quality in the Caribbean during the 2000s. In contrast, the abundance of generalist fishes remained relatively stable over the same three decades. Few specialist species are fished, thus their population declines are most likely linked to habitat degradation. These results mirror the observed trends of replacement of specialists by generalists, observed in terrestrial taxa across the globe. A significant challenge that arises from our findings is now to investigate if, and how, such community-level changes in fish populations affect ecosystem function.","[Alvarez-Filip, Lorenzo] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Unidad Acad Sistemas Arrecifales, Puerto Morelos, Quintana Roo, Mexico; [Alvarez-Filip, Lorenzo; Paddack, Michelle J.; Cote, Isabelle M.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Paddack, Michelle J.] Santa Barbara City Coll, Dept Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93109 USA; [Ben Collen] UCL, Ctr Biodivers & Environm Res, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Robertson, D.

The eight available mitogenomes of anemonefishes were used to reconstruct the molecular phylogenetic tree; six were obtained from this study (Amphiprion clarkii, A. frenatus, A. percula, A. perideraion, A. polymnus and Premnas biaculeatus) and two from GenBank (A. bicinctus and A. ocellaris). The seven Amphiprion species represent all four subgenera and P. biaculeatus is the only species from Premnas. The eight mitogenomes of anemonefishes encoded 13 protein-coding genes, two rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes and two main non-coding regions, with the gene arrangement and translation direction basically identical to other typical vertebrate mitogenomes. Among the 13 protein-coding genes, A. ocellaris (AP006017) and A. percula (KJ174497) had the same length in ND5 with 1,866 bp, which were three nucleotides less than the other six anemonefishes. Both structures of ND5, however, could translate to amino acid successfully. Only four mitogenomes had the tandem repeats in D-loop; the tandem repeats were located in downstream after Conserved Sequence Block rather than the upstream and repeated in a simply way. The phylogenetic utility was tested with Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood methods using all 13 protein-coding genes. The results strongly supported that the subfamily Amphiprioninae was monophyletic and P. biaculeatus should be assigned to the genus Amphiprion. Premnas biaculeatus with the percula complex were revealed to be the ancient anemonefish species. The tree forms of ND1, COIII, ND4, Cytb, Cytb+ 12S rRNA, Cytb+ and Cytb+ COI+ 12S rRNA were similar to that 13 protein-coding genes, therefore, we suggested that the suitable single mitochondrial gene for phylogenetic analysis of anemonefishes maybe Cytb. Additional mitogenomes of anemonefishes with a combination of nuclear markers will be useful to substantiate these conclusions in future studies.","[Li, Jianlong; Liu, Min] Xiamen Univ, Coll Ocean & Earth Sci, State Key Lab Marine Environm Sci, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xiao] Guangxi Acad Sci, Guangxi Mangrove Res Ctr, Guangxi Key Lab Mangrove Conservat & Utilizat, Beihai, Guangxi, Peoples R China; [Kang, Bin] Jimei Univ, Coll Fisheries, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China",2,10.1371/journal.pone.0123894,2015

It is likely that projected ocean acidification levels will aggravate coral reef health. We first investigated how ocean acidification interacts with one near shore locally abundant metal on the physiology of two major reef-building corals: Stylophora pistillata and Acropora muricata. Two pH levels (pH(T) 8.02; pCO(2) 366 mu atm and pH(T) 7.75; pCO(2) 1140 mu atm) and two cobalt concentrations (natural, 0.03 mu g L-1 and polluted, 0.2 mu g L-1) were tested during five weeks in aquaria. We found that, for both species, cobalt input decreased significantly their growth rates by 28% while it stimulated their photosystem II, with higher values of rETR(max) (relative Electron Transport Rate). Elevated pCO(2) levels acted differently on the coral rETR(max) values and did not affect their growth rates. No consistent interaction was found between pCO(2) levels and cobalt concentrations. We also measured in situ the effect of higher cobalt concentrations (1.06 +/- 0.16 mu g L-1) on A. muricata using benthic chamber experiments. At this elevated concentration, cobalt decreased simultaneously coral growth and photosynthetic rates, indicating that the toxic threshold for this pollutant has been reached for both host cells and zooxanthellae. Our results from both aquaria and in situ experiments, suggest that these coral species are not particularly sensitive to high pCO(2) conditions but they are to ecologically relevant cobalt concentrations. Our study reveals that some reefs may be yet subjected to deleterious pollution levels, and even if no interaction between pCO(2) levels and cobalt concentration has been found, it is likely that coral metabolism will be weakened if they are subjected to additional threats such as temperature increase, other heavy metals, and eutrophication.","[Biscere, Tom; Rodolfo-Metalpa, Riccardo; Houlbreque, Fanny] ENTROPIE UMR9220, Inst Rech Dev, Lab Excellence CORAIL, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia; [Lorrain, Anne] IRD Noumea, IRD R LEMAR 195, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia; [Chauvaud, Laurent; Thebault, Julien; Clavier, Jacques] Univ Brest, Inst Univ Europeen Mer, CNRS IRD UBO UMR6539, Lab Sci Environm Marin, F-29280 Plouzane, France",11,10.1371/journal.pone.0122898,2015

Consistent with previous smaller-scale studies, our results show sharp declines in reef fish biomass at relatively low human population density, followed by more gradual declines as human population density increased further. Adjusting for other factors, the highest levels of oceanic productivity among our study locations were associated with more than double the biomass of reef fishes (including similar to 4 times the biomass of planktivores and piscivores) compared to islands with lowest oceanic productivity.

Larvae were unable to swim at against a minimum current speed of < 0.5 cm s(-1) until 10 dph (7 mm TL), after which U (crit) significantly increased with increasing TL until the onset of metamorphosis and subsequent settlement. Mean (+/- SD) U (crit) was 0.38(0.35), 1.59(0.54), 2.27(0.49) and 2.99(0.37) cm s(-1) for stage I (6.61 +/- A 2.64 mm TL), stage II (7.75 +/- A 0.60 mm TL), stage III (9.10 +/- A 1.00 mm TL) and stage IV (11.59 +/- A 0.85 mm TL) larvae, respectively. Larval TL, DW, DNA content, RNA content and U (crit) significantly increased, whereas sRD significantly declined as larvae developed from stage I to V. Although inter-individual differences in U (crit) (coefficient of variation, CV = 33 %) were as large as those in biochemical and morphological condition (CV's of 21-42 %), differences in U (crit) were not significantly related to those in nutritional condition and larvae with lower DNA/DW had also better swimming abilities. These estimates should be useful to ongoing efforts to create individual-based models of the transport, foraging and growth of plaice larvae in the North Sea.","[Silva, Luis; Garrido, Susana] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal; [Moyano, Marta; Illing, Bjoern; Peck, Myron A.] Univ Hamburg, Inst Hydrobiol & Fisheries Sci, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany; [Faria, Ana M.] Inst Super Psicol Aplicada, Ecoethol Res Unit, P-1149041 Lisbon, Portugal; [Garrido, Susana] IPMA, P-1449006 Lisbon, Portugal",2,10.1007/s00227-015-2621-0,2015

We collected 214 invasive red lionfish samples from nine countries and territories, including seven unpublished locations. To more comprehensively evaluate connectivity, we compiled our d-loop sequence data with 846 published sequences, resulting in 1,060 samples from 14 locations. We found low nucleotide diversity (pi = 0.003) and moderate haplotype diversity (h = 0.59). Using haplotype population pairwise I broken vertical bar (ST) tests, we analyzed possible phylogeographic breaks that were previously proposed based on other reef organisms. We found support for the Bahamas/Turks/Caicos versus Caribbean break (I broken vertical bar (ST) = 0.12) but not for the Northwestern Caribbean, Eastern Caribbean, or US East Coast versus Bahamas breaks. The Northern Region had higher variation and more haplotypes, supporting introductions of at least five haplotypes to the region. Our wide-ranging samples showed that a lower-frequency haplotype in the Northern Region dominated the Southern Region and suggested multiple introductions, possibly to the south. We tested multiple scenarios of phylogeographic structure with analyses of molecular variance and found support for a Northern and Southern Region split at the Bahamas/Turks/Caicos versus Caribbean break (percentage of variation among regions = 8.49 %). We found that Puerto Rico clustered with the Southern Region more strongly than with the Northern Region, as opposed to previous reports. We also found the rare haplotype H03 for the first time in the southern Caribbean (Panama), indicating that either secondary releases occurred or that the low-frequency haplotypes have had time to disperse to extreme southern Caribbean locations.","[Butterfield, John S.

Although bleaching leaves the coral skeleton visible under its transparent tissue, not all white coral colonies display this feature. This raises the question as to whether all 'white'-shaded colonies are indeed bleached. Within this context, Montastraea cavernosa colonies of different colour types (dark brown, light brown, bleached and white) were sampled for photobiological evaluation. Here, we show that, while the conventional spectral reflectance techniques failed to discriminate white from bleached colonies, chlorophyll fluorescence, photosynthetic pigment profile and Symbiodinium density enabled a clear distinction between these shades. Subsequently, video transects from reef monitoring surveys at Todos os Santos Bay (Brazil) revealed that the proportion of bleached and white colonies is similar, thus suggesting that current coral reef surveys may be overestimating the bleaching of M. cavernosa by nearly twofold.","[Cruz, Igor C.

Shallow coral reefs provide food and shelter for highly diverse fish assemblages but are increasingly modified by anthropogenic activities. We hypothesized that the introduction of seaweed farms into degraded shallow coral reefs had potential to generate ecological benefits for fish by adding structural complexity and a possible food source. We conducted 210 transects at 14 locations, with sampling stratified across seaweed farms and sites adjacent to and distant from farms. At a seascape scale, locations were classified by their level of exposure to human disturbance. We compared sites where (1) marine protected areas (MPAs) were established, (2) neither MPAs nor blast fishing was present (hence ""unprotected""), and (3) blast fishing occurred. We observed 80,186 fish representing 148 species from 38 families. The negative effects of seaweed farms on fish assemblages appeared stronger in the absence of blast fishing and were strongest when MPAs were present, likely reflecting the positive influence of the MPAs on fish within them. Species differentiating fish assemblages with respect to seaweed farming and disturbance were typically small but also included two key target species. The propensity for seaweed farms to increase fish diversity, abundance, and biomass is limited and may reduce MPA benefits. We suggest that careful consideration be given to the placement of seaweed farms relative to MPAs.","[Hehre, E.

Therefore, it can be difficult to identify morphological and/or physiological traits responsible for enhancing performance in a given habitat. In fishes, differences in swimming performance across water flow gradients are related to morphological variation among and within species. However, physiological traits related to performance have been less well studied. We experimentally reared juvenile damselfish, Acanthochromis polyacanthus, under different water flow regimes to test 1) whether aspects of swimming physiology and morphology show plastic responses to water flow, 2) whether trait divergence correlates with swimming performance and 3) whether flow environment relates to performance differences observed in wild fish. We found that maximum metabolic rate, aerobic scope and blood haematocrit were higher in wave-reared fish compared to fish reared in low water flow. However, pectoral fin shape, which tends to correlate with sustained swimming performance, did not differ between rearing treatments or collection sites. Maximum metabolic rate was the best overall predictor of individual swimming performance; fin shape and fish total length were 3.3 and 3.7 times less likely than maximum metabolic rate to explain differences in critical swimming speed. Performance differences induced in fish reared in different flow environments were less pronounced than in wild fish but similar in direction. Our results suggest that exposure to water motion induces plastic physiological changes which enhance swimming performance in A. polyacanthus. Thus, functional relationships between fish morphology and performance across flow habitats should also consider differences in physiology.","[Binning, Sandra A.; Roche, Dominique G.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Div Evolut Ecol & Genet, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Binning, Sandra A.; Roche, Dominique G.] Australian Natl Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Binning, Sandra A.; Ros, Albert F.

The popularization of SCUBA diving has added a new dimension to human impacts in aquatic systems and, although individual-level impacts have been identified, cumulative effects on ecosystem function and community-wide responses are unclear. In principle, habituation may mitigate the consequences of human presence on the biology of an individual and allow the quick resumption of its ecological roles, but this has not been documented in aquatic systems. Here, we investigate the short-term impact of human presence and the long-term habituation potential of reef-fish communities to recreational SCUBA divers by studying symbiotic cleaning interactions on coral reefs with differing levels of historical contact with divers. We show that incidences of human contact result in a smaller decline in ecosystem function and more rapid resumption of baseline services on a reef in Utila, Honduras that has heavy historical levels of SCUBA diver presence, compared to an un-dived reef site in the Cayos Cochinos Marine Protected Area (CCMPA). Nonetheless, despite the generally smaller change in ecosystem function and decades of regular contact with divers, cleaning behavior is suppressed by >50% at Utila when divers are present. We hypothesize that community-wide habituation of reef fish is not fully achievable and may be biologically restricted to only partial habituation. Differential responses to human presence impacts the interpretation and execution of behavioral research where SCUBA is the predominant means of data collection, and provides an important rationale for future research investigating the interplay between human presence, ecosystem function, and community structure on coral reefs.","[Titus, Benjamin M.; Daly, Marymegan] Ohio State Univ, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Titus, Benjamin M.; Exton, Dan A.] Operat Wallacea, Spilsby, Lincs, England",13,10.1371/journal.pone.0119645,2015

Environmental variability is important to characterize because it can amplify or dampen the biological consequences of global change, depending on the functional relationship between mean temperature or pH and organismal traits. Here, we characterize the spatiotemporal variability of pH, temperature, and salinity at fringing reefs in Moorea, French Polynesia and Nanwan Bay, Taiwan using advanced time series analysis, including wavelet analysis, and infer their potential impact on the persistence and stability of coral populations. Our results demonstrate that both the mean and variance of pH and temperature differed significantly between sites in Moorea and Taiwan. Seawater temperature at the Moorea site passed the local bleaching threshold several times within the similar to 45 day deployment while aragonite saturation state at the Taiwan site was often below commonly observed levels for coral reefs. Our results showcase how a better understanding of the differences in environmental conditions between sites can (1) provide an important frame of reference for designing laboratory experiments to study the effects of environmental variability, (2) identify the proximity of current environmental conditions to predicted biological thresholds for the coral reef, and (3) help predict when the temporal variability and mean of environmental conditions will interact synergistically or antagonistically to alter the abundance and stability of marine populations experiencing climate change.","[Rivest, Emily B.] Univ Calif Davis, Bodega Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA; [Gouhier, Tarik C.] Northeastern Univ, Ctr Marine Sci, Nahant, MA 01908 USA",9,10.1371/journal.pone.0121742,2015

However, current studies of territorial grazer effects on corals have focused on back-reef habitats. Territorial damselfishes occur in distinct behavioural guilds ranging from indeterminate territorial grazers with thin algal turfs and low rates of territorial aggression to intensive territorial grazers with thick turfs and high rates of aggression. To determine the impact of territorial grazers on the establishment of juvenile corals, we surveyed the reef crest habitat of Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef, using fixed transects to assess the effects of indeterminate and intensive territorial grazers on juvenile coral abundance and taxonomic composition. In addition, the turnover of territorial pomacentrids was monitored as well as the effects of turnover on juvenile coral assemblages. Intensive territorial grazers were associated with a significantly lower juvenile coral abundance (34 % decrease), but neither intensive nor indeterminate grazer territories impacted juvenile coral taxonomic composition. Over the course of 1 yr, there was a high rate of territorial turnover (39.7 %). Turnover from control plots to intensive damselfish territories was accompanied by a 44 % decrease in juvenile corals; conversely, turnover from intensive damselfish territories to control plots coincided with a 48 % increase in juvenile corals. These findings reveal two main conclusions. Firstly, the association between damselfish territories and the abundance and spatial turnover of juvenile corals strongly implies that territorial grazers have a negative effect on juvenile coral populations. Secondly, the unexpectedly high temporal turnover of damselfish territories indicates that damselfish-coral-algae linkages are highly dynamic, may be extensively influenced by local-scale effects, and have the potential to impact the structure of coral assemblages on coral reef fronts.","[Casey, J.

These differences in coral density decreased as coral size increased. Direct farming effects of the damselfish and indirect inhibitory effects from higher algal densities inside territories are both thought to be potentially responsible for the results attained herein.

We exclude data for the large-scale tuna fleets, which have largely foreign beneficial ownership, even when flying Pacific flags. However, we recognize the considerable financial contributions derived from foreign access or charter fees for Pacific host countries. The reconstructions for the 25 entities from 1950 to 2010 suggested that total domestic catches were 2.5 times the data reported to FAO. This discrepancy was largest in early periods (1950: 6.4 times), while for 2010, total catches were 1.7 times the reported data. There was a significant difference in trend between reported and reconstructed catches since 2000, with reconstructed catches declining strongly since their peak in 2000. Total catches increased from 110,000 t yr(-1) in 1950 (of which 17,400 t were reported) to a peak of over 250,000 t yr(-1) in 2000, before declining to around 200,000 t yr(-1) by 2010. This decrease is driven by a declining artisanal (small-scale commercial) catch, which was not compensated for by increasing domestic industrial (large-scale commercial) catches. The artisanal fisheries appear to be declining from a peak of 97,000 t yr(-1) in 1992 to less than 50,000 t yr(-1) by 2010. However, total catches were dominated by subsistence (small-scale, non-commercial) fisheries, which accounted for 69 % of total catches, with the majority missing from the reported data. Artisanal catches accounted for 22 %, while truly domestic industrial fisheries accounted for only 6 % of total catches. The smallest component is the recreational (small-scale, non-commercial and largely for leisure) sector (2 %), which, although small in catch, is likely of economic importance in some areas due to its direct link to tourism income.","[Zeller, D.; Harper, S.; Zylich, K.; Pauly, D.] Univ British Columbia, Fisheries Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",53,10.1007/s00338-014-1219-1,2015

The reduced consumption of Acanthophora was related to 53-85 % reductions in the feeding rates of two herbivorous fish species, Kyphosus vaigiensis and Siganus doliatus. Neither Acanthophora nor Sargassum were afforded protection when paired with the brown macroalga Turbinaria.

The reef accreted up to 3.75 m of vertical framework with accretion rates that averaged 2.53 m kyr(-1). The reef was composed of a nearly even mixture of Acropora palmata and massive corals. In many cases, cores show an upward transition from massives to A. palmata and may indicate local dominance by this species prior to reef demise. Quantitative macroscopic analyses of reef clasts for various taphonomic and diagenetic features did not correlate well with depth/environmental-related trends established in other studies. The mixed coral framestone reef lacks a classical Caribbean reef zonation and is best described as an immature reef and/or a series of fused patch reefs; a pattern that is evident in both cores and reef morphology. This is in stark contrast to the older and deeper outer reef of the SE Florida continental reef tract. Accretion of the outer reef lasted from 10,695-8,000 Cal BP and resulted in a larger and better developed structure that achieved a distinct reef zonation. The discrepancies in overall reef morphology and size as well as the causes of reef terminations remain elusive without further study, yet they likely point to different climatic/environmental conditions during their respective accretion histories.","[Stathakopoulos, A.; Riegl, B.

We investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of diseases affecting CCA along the south coast of Cura double dagger ao, southern Caribbean. Two syndromes were detected: the Coralline White Band Syndrome (CWBS) previously described and the Coralline White Patch Disease (CWPD) reported here for the first time. Diseases were present at all six study sites, and our results did not reveal a relationship between disease occurrence and human influence. Both diseases were more prevalent on the shallower reef flat than on the deeper reef slope, and during the warm/rainy season than during the cold/dry season. The patterns observed were consistent with a positive link between temperature and disease occurrence. Reef flat communities were dominated by Neogoniolithon mamillare and Paragoniolithon solubile, whereas deeper habitats were dominated by Hydrolithon boergesenii. Diseases affected all the species encountered, and no preferable host was detected. There was a significant relationship between both disease occurrences and CCA cover. Monitoring of affected patches revealed that 90 % of lesions in CWBS increased in size, whereas 88 % of CWPD lesions regenerated over time. CWBS linear progression rate did not vary between seasons or species and ranged from 0.15 to 0.36 cm month(-1), which is in the same order of magnitude as rates previously documented. We conclude that diseases have the potential to cause major loss in CCA cover, particularly in shallow waters. As CCA play a key role in reef ecosystems, our study suggests that the emergence of diseases affecting these algae may pose a real threat to coral reef ecosystems. The levels of disease reported here will provide a much-needed local baseline allowing future comparisons.","[Quere, G.] Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Ecol ZMT, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Quere, G.; Nugues, M.

Here, we present the first account of the annual reproductive cycle of the pantropical sea urchin Echinometra sp. from the Gulf of Aqaba/Eilat (Red Sea) and explore some of the main environmental variables that drive echinoid reproduction. Monthly measurements of gonado-somatic indexes and histological observations of 20 specimens revealed a single seasonal reproductive cycle, with gametogenesis in males and females being highly synchronized. Gametogenesis commenced in June and peak spawning occurred between September and October. Gonado-somatic indexes were significantly correlated with seawater temperatures but not with photoperiod. The latter cycle lagged behind the gonado-somatic cycle by two months, suggesting that the onset of gametogenesis corresponds to shortening day length, while spawning may be driven by warming seawater temperatures. Gonads remained quiescent throughout the winter and spring (January through May) when temperatures were at their lowest. Chlorophyll-a concentrations increased significantly in the months following spawning (October through January). These high concentrations are indicative of high phytoplankton abundance and may reflect the increase in food availability for the developing larvae. Of the external test dimensions, length presented the highest correlation to body weight, indicating length as the best predictor for body size in Echinometra. Neither sexual dimorphism nor size differences between males and females were detected, and the sex ratios were approximately 1:1 in three distant Echinometra populations. Environmentally regulated reproduction, as occurs in sea urchins, might face severe outcomes due to anthropogenic disturbances to the marine environment. Consequently, there is a need to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms that drive and regulate this process in broadcast-spawning species.","[Bronstein, Omri; Loya, Yossi] Tel Aviv Univ, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",8,10.1007/s00338-014-1209-3,2015

This is particularly important in rapidly developing, land-scarce nations (such as Singapore) that require targeted conservation efforts. Sixty percentage of Singapore's coral cover has been lost over the past five decades, and with further coastal reclamation underway, it is imperative to understand the effects of development on coral connectivity. In this study, we used seven microsatellite markers, of which six are newly described here, to investigate the genetic diversity and connectivity of the massive hard coral Platygyra sinensis at nine sites in Singapore and three in the nearby Indonesian island of Bintan. Our results show that P. sinensis currently retains large effective population sizes, high genetic diversity, as well as high connectivity among sites within each locality, which suggest that these populations have good potential for continued survival provided that there are no island-wide disturbances. However, the Singapore Strait appears to be a mild barrier to gene flow, which may lead to an increased reliance on self-seeding at either location. We suggest some directions for their management based on these potential population boundaries, which can help pave the path for marine conservation planning in Singapore.","[Tay, Y.

Locations separated by up to 1,700 km lacked genetic differentiation, confirming the ability for long-range dispersal. However, significant differentiation was detected among other regions. Samples from Utila, Honduras showed the greatest differentiation, suggesting that the circulation of the Mesoamerican gyre could be a significant factor restricting gene flow in this region. Demographic analyses provided strong evidence for a population expansion, possibly out of Florida, through the Caribbean, and into Honduras, which commenced in the early Pleistocene. However, the presence of a clade of rare haplotypes, which split much earlier (mid-Pliocene), indicates that O. suensonii persisted long before its recent expansion, suggesting a cyclic history of population contraction and expansion. Finally, patterns of gene flow are not concordant with contemporary surface currents; rather, they reflect historical movements possibly linked with changes in circulation during periods of Pleistocene climate change.","[Richards, V.

Strong correlations between the delta N-15 of skeletal organic material and that of coral tissue in two scleractinian corals (Porites lutea and Favia stelligera) across a tropical coral reef flat support the use of CS-delta N-15 in reconstructing coral biomass delta N-15 changes. However, we observed a consistent and species-specific offset between the coral tissue delta N-15 and the skeletal CS-delta N-15. As such, the CS-delta N-15 is not an absolute measure of tissue delta N-15. The CS-delta N-15 of both coral species and three species of macroalgae increased across the reef flat in response to a natural gradient in water column delta N-15. There was an apparent dampening of the water column delta N-15 gradient recorded in the coral tissue delta N-15 and the CS-delta N-15, possibly caused by shifting trophic status of corals across the reef flat. The CS-delta N-15 therefore appears to robustly reflect the delta N-15 of the coral tissue, and the coral system is responsive to the delta N-15 of the water column N pools. The distortion of the true water column delta N-15 by corals requires further investigation and is an important consideration for the use of coral skeletons in temporal reconstructions of water column delta N-15.","[Erler, Dirk V.; Scheffers, Sander R.; Shepherd, Benjamin O.] So Cross Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Lismore, NSW 2480, Australia; [Wang, Xingchen T.; Sigman, Daniel M.] Princeton Univ, Dept Geosci, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA",6,10.1007/s00338-014-1215-5,2015

We present high-resolution estimates of net community calcification (NCC) and net community production (NCP) from Palmyra Atoll, an uninhabited, near-pristine coral reef ecosystem in the central Pacific. In August-October 2012, we employed a combination of Lagrangian and Eulerian frameworks to establish high spatial (similar to 2.5 km(2)) and temporal (hourly) resolution coral community metabolic estimates. Lagrangian drifts, all conducted during daylight hours, resulted in NCC estimates of -51 to 116 mmol C m(-2) h(-1), although most NCC estimates were in the range of 0-40 mmol C m(-2) h(-1). Lagrangian drift NCP estimates ranged from -7 to 67 mmol C m(-2) h(-1). In the Eulerian setup, we present carbonate system parameters (dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, pH, and pCO(2)) at sub-hourly resolution through several day-night cycles and provide hourly NCC and NCP rate estimates. We compared diel cycles of all four carbonate system parameters to the offshore surface water (0-50 m depth) and show large departures from offshore surface water chemistry. Hourly Eulerian estimates of NCC aggregated over the entire study ranged from 14 to 53 mmol C m(-2) h(-1), showed substantial variability during daylight hours, and exhibited a diel cycle with elevated NCC in the afternoons and depressed, but positive, NCC at night. The Eulerian NCP range was very high (-55 to 177 mmol C m(-2) h(-1)) and exhibited strong variability during daylight hours. Principal components analysis revealed that NCC and NCP were most closely aligned with diel cycle forcing, whereas the NCC/NCP ratio was most closely aligned with reef community composition. Our analysis demonstrates that ecological community composition is the primary determinant of coral reef biogeochemistry on a near-pristine reef and that reef biogeochemistry is likely to be responsive to human behaviors that alter community composition.","[Koweek, David; Dunbar, Robert B.; Mucciarone, David; Teneva, Lida] Stanford Univ, Dept Environm Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Rogers, Justin S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Williams, Gareth J.; Price, Nichole] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Ctr Marine Biodivers & Conservat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",16,10.1007/s00338-014-1217-3,2015

This study assessed public understanding of OA and how social and demographic factors influence the public's concern for OA. The analysis was based on 311 questionnaires from full-time Alaska residents. The results showed that most Alaskans self-reported to have a basic awareness of OA, and subsequently were able to recognize that CO2 emissions related to human activity are the dominant driver of changing ocean conditions. However, there was a low recognition of how natural variability in the marine environment affects OA, and most respondents were not very confident in their understanding of OA-related science. Moreover, even though many communities in Alaska are reliant on commercial and subsistence fishing activities, the respondents had a low awareness of fisheries-related OA risk. Given the ongoing debate associated with climate change research, evaluating CO2 mitigation efforts through the perspective of OA could give individuals an unbiased way to assess the pros and cons of more intensive efforts to curb CO2 emissions. Furthermore, using OA communication to enhance the understanding of how natural variability influences OA around the state and the potential economic implications for Alaska fisheries would help residents and stakeholders make informed decisions when considering fisheries management plans, food security, and job diversity as OA intensifies. Solidifying the understanding that any reduction in pH and intensification of OA can have implications for marine species that are irreversible on human timescales will reinforce not only that OA is an immediate concern, but also the importance of taking action now.

Factors such as competition, habitat availability, and male characteristics can influence an individual's ability to establish and maintain a territory. The risk of predation can have an important influence on feeding and reproduction; however, few have studied its effect on territoriality. We investigated territoriality in a haremic, polygynous species of coral reef herbivore, Sparisoma aurofrenatum (redband parrotfish), across eight reefs in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary that were either protected or unprotected from fishing of piscivorous fishes. We examined how territory size and quality varied with reef protection status, competition, predation risk, and male size. We then determined how territory size and quality influenced harem size and female size to understand the effect of territoriality on reproductive potential. We found that protected reefs trended towards having more large predatory fishes and that territories there were smaller but had greater algal nutritional quality relative to unprotected reefs. Our data suggest that even though males in protected sites have smaller territories, which support fewer females, they may improve their reproductive potential by choosing nutritionally rich areas, which support larger females. Thus, reef protection appears to shape the trade-off that herbivorous fishes make between territory size and quality. Furthermore, we provide evidence that males in unprotected sites, which are generally less complex than protected sites, choose territories with higher structural complexity, suggesting the importance of this type of habitat for feeding and reproduction in S. aurofrenatum. Our work argues that the loss of corals and the resulting decline in structural complexity, as well as management efforts to protect reefs, could alter the territory dynamics and reproductive potential of important herbivorous fish species.","[Catano, Laura B.; Gunn, Bridgette K.; Kelley, Megan C.; Burkepile, Deron E.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Marine Sci Program, North Miami, FL 33027 USA",9,10.1371/journal.pone.0118764,2015

Despite these benefits, genetic manipulations are rarely considered for noncommercial purposes, such as conservation and restoration initiatives. Over the last century, humans have driven global climate change through industrialization and the release of increasing amounts of CO2, resulting in shifts in ocean temperature, ocean chemistry, and sea level, as well as increasing frequency of storms, all of which can profoundly impact marine ecosystems. Coral reefs are highly diverse ecosystems that have suffered massive declines in health and abundance as a result of these and other direct anthropogenic disturbances. There is great concern that the high rates, magnitudes, and complexity of environmental change are overwhelming the intrinsic capacity of corals to adapt and survive. Although it is important to address the root causes of changing climate, it is also prudent to explore the potential to augment the capacity of reef organisms to tolerate stress and to facilitate recovery after disturbances. Here, we review the risks and benefits of the improvement of natural and commercial stocks in noncoral reef systems and advocate a series of experiments to determine the feasibility of developing coral stocks with enhanced stress tolerance through the acceleration of naturally occurring processes, an approach known as (human)-assisted evolution, while at the same time initiating a public dialogue on the risks and benefits of this approach.","[van Oppen, Madeleine J.

Defining which habitat-linked cues are implicated in sessile invertebrate larval settlement has largely concentrated on chemical cues which are thought to signal optimal habitat. There has been less effort establishing physical settlement cues, including the role of surface microtopography. This laboratory based study tested whether surface microtopography alone (without chemical cues) plays an important contributing role in the settlement of larvae of coral reef sessile invertebrates. We measured settlement to tiles, engineered with surface microtopography (holes) that closely matched the sizes (width) of larvae of a range of corals and sponges, in addition to surfaces with holes that were markedly larger than larvae. Larvae from two species of scleractinian corals (Acropora millepora and Ctenactis crassa) and three species of coral reef sponges (Luffariella variabilis, Carteriospongia foliascens and Ircinia sp.,) were used in experiments. L. variabilis, A. millepora and C. crassa showed markedly higher settlement to surface microtopography that closely matched their larval width. C. foliascens and Ircinia sp., showed no specificity to surface microtopography, settling just as often to microtopography as to flat surfaces. The findings of this study question the sole reliance on chemical based larval settlement cues, previously established for some coral and sponge species, and demonstrate that specific physical cues (surface complexity) can also play an important role in larval settlement of coral reef sessile invertebrates.","[Whalan, Steve] So Cross Univ, Marine Ecol Res Ctr, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Lismore, NSW 2480, Australia; [Wahab, Muhammad A.

Therefore, understanding how the behaviour and spatial ecology of a species differs across reef habitats is essential for developing sound conservation approaches. The present study examined the residency, movement and activity space of grey reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) in the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR). An array of 56 acoustic receivers covering 17 semi-isolated coral reefs across 150 km was used to monitor shark movements. Forty C. amblyrhynchos were tagged with acoustic transmitters and monitored from 251 to 821 days. Most sharks were detected on a single reef; however, some individuals (4 females; 10 males) moved to up to five reefs. Residency index ranged from 0.02 to 1.0, with a mean +/- A SD of 0.78 +/- A 0.26. Mixed-effect models showed that weekly and monthly residency was mainly influenced by shark size, with little or no effect of environmental parameters. Although C. amblyrhynchos were present year-round, juvenile sharks had lower residency to their tagging reef than adults. In addition, mature females were detected less between November and mid-February, which coincides with reported parturition in the central GBR. Long-term monitoring data revealed that C. amblyrhynchos exhibited high residency to their tagging reef, and therefore, even in systems with semi-isolated reefs such as the GBR, this species may benefit from spatial management approaches at the reef level. However, behavioural differences between sexes and life-stages of C. amblyrhynchos reported in this study suggest marine reserves may provide lower protection relative to more remote and isolated coral reefs.","[Espinoza, Mario; Heupel, Michelle.

We examined the influence of water flow, a pervasive feature of reefs that is known to affect both coral and algal physiology, on massive Porites-algal interactions at different spatial and temporal scales with two types of algal competitors. Outcomes of coral-algal interactions were influenced by both water flow and algal type. Algal turfs outcompeted corals more frequently in low flow conditions, where microbial concentrations were higher, than in higher flow areas. Turbinaria ornata outcompeted massive Porites more often in higher flow and consistently was associated with lower microbial concentrations.

To date, our understanding of the range and importance of factors limiting knowledge exchange between scientists and decision-makers is based primarily on the perceptions of decision-makers, while the perceptions of scientists have been largely overlooked. This study addresses this knowledge gap by quantitatively assessing the perceptions of scientists, represented by a sample of 78 Australian marine scientists, regarding (i) the role and importance of engaging with environmental decision-makers on a personal level, (ii) the role and importance of engaging with environmental decision-makers at the institutional level, (iii) current barriers to engaging with environmental decision-makers and (iv) options for overcoming barriers to engaging with environmental decision-makers. Survey results suggest that Australian marine scientists feel that they have an obligation to engage decision-makers in their science, and that engaging with and communicating to environmental decision-makers is important on a personal level. This study also identifies a range of barriers that impede engagement activities, including inadequate measures of science impact that do not account for engagement activities, a lack of organisational support for engagement activities, insufficient time to conduct engagement activities in addition to other responsibilities and a lack of funding to support engagement activities. To overcome these barriers, participants identified the need for institutional innovation by research institutions, research funders and decision-making agencies alike to promote a culture whereby knowledge exchange activities are legitimised as core business for research scientists, and recognised and rewarded appropriately.

Studies on the causes, effects and consequences of phase shifts on reef fish communities have only been considered for coral-to-macroalgae shifts. Therefore, there is a large information gap regarding the consequences of novel phase shifts and how these kinds of phase shifts impact on fish assemblages. This study aimed to compare the fish assemblages on reefs under normal conditions (relatively high cover of corals) to those which have shifted to a dominance of the zoantharian Palythoa cf. variabilis on coral reefs in Todos os Santos Bay (TSB), Brazilian eastern coast. We examined eight reefs, where we estimated cover of corals and P. cf. variabilis and coral reef fish richness, abundance and body size. Fish richness differed significantly between normal reefs (48 species) and phase-shift reefs (38 species), a 20% reduction in species. However there was no difference in fish abundance between normal and phase shift reefs. One fish species, Chaetodon striatus, was significantly less abundant on normal reefs. The differences in fish assemblages between different reef phases was due to differences in trophic groups of fish; on normal reefs carnivorous fishes were more abundant, while on phase shift reefs mobile invertivores dominated.","[Cruz, Igor C.

This phenotype appears to be highly plastic and present in individuals experiencing high-risk environments, but rarer in those experiencing low-risk environments. Despite the appeal of this strategy as a 'solution' for prey naivety, we lack evidence that this strategy provides any fitness benefit to prey. Here, we compare the relative effect of environmental risk (high versus low) and predator-recognition training (predator-naive versus predator-experienced individuals) on the survival of juvenile fish in the wild. We found that juveniles raised in high-risk conditions survived better than those raised in low-risk conditions, providing the first empirical evidence that environmental risk, in the absence of any predator-specific information, affects the way naive prey survive in a novel environment. Both risk level and experience affected survival; however, the two factors did not interact, indicating that the information provided by both factors did not interfere or enhance each other. From a mechanistic viewpoint, this indicates that the combination of the two factors may increase the intensity, and hence efficacy, of prey evasion strategies, or that both factors provide qualitatively separate benefits that would result in an additive survival success.","[Ferrari, Maud C.

While satellite sensing of SST has proved a reliable predictor of coral bleaching at the regional scale, there are large deviations in bleaching severity and mortality on the local scale that are poorly understood. Here, we show that internal waves play a major role in explaining local coral bleaching and mortality patterns in the Andaman Sea. Despite a severe region-wide SST anomaly in May 2010, frequent upslope intrusions of cold sub-pycnocline waters due to breaking large-amplitude internal waves (LAIW) mitigated coral bleaching and mortality in shallow waters. In LAIW-sheltered waters, by contrast, bleaching-susceptible species suffered severe bleaching and total mortality. These findings suggest that LAIW benefit coral reefs during thermal stress and provide local refugia for bleaching-susceptible corals. LAIW are ubiquitous in tropical stratified waters and their swash zones may thus be important conservation areas for the maintenance of coral diversity in a warming climate. Taking LAIW into account can significantly improve coral bleaching predictions and provide a valuable tool for coral reef conservation and management.","[Wall, M.; Putchim, L.; Schmidt, G.

Most studies, however, present co-management as the sharing of power between resource users and centralised government, and do not explicitly consider the role of a more diverse set of stakeholders, or what roles different stakeholder types are best positioned to perform. This paper contributes to our understanding of stakeholder diversity by determining, through surveys with 133 fishery stakeholders in Solomon Islands, which stakeholder types are perceived as most suited to particular co-management roles, and which stakeholder types should be collaborating to increase fishery stocks. The effect of respondent socio-demographics, on perceived roles, is tested to explore the value of the role typology. Ten dominant roles were identified across seven stakeholder types, including collaboration and raising awareness, which were perceived to be dominantly the domain of auxiliary stakeholders that are not explicitly recognised in the co-management literature, including NGOs and church leaders. Of the socio-demographic variables tested, only site explained some of the variation in stakeholder roles perceived by respondents. The primary value of the typology lies in its potential to be used as a basis for dialogue on strengths and weaknesses of allocated roles for increasing fish stocks in existing co-management systems.

The use of ecologically and biologically significant areas (EBSAs) criteria to evaluate important areas enables the identification of effective and prioritized areas for ecosystem management. This includes strategic environmental assessment and discussions aimed at establishing protected marine areas based on scientific data. This paper reviews previous and current ideas as well as the methods used, for the identification of EBSAs. In particular, the following issues are addressed: problems associated with different types of marine ecosystems in the Japanese Archipelago, such as seagrass and seaweed beds, coral reefs, offshore pelagic plankton, and deep-sea benthic ecosystems; and problems associated with the integration of multiple criteria that are not totally exclusive. Several candidate variables accounting for each of the 7 criteria used to identify ecologically important areas are presented. Data availability is the most important criterion that allowed for the comprehensive evaluation of different types of ecosystems in the same localities. In particular, for coastal ecosystems such as seagrass, seaweed beds, and coral reefs, it is possible to carry out broad spatial comparisons using variables representing most of these 7 criteria. Regarding methods for the quantitative evaluation of each criterion and their integration, application of these methods to kelp forest ecosystems in Hokkaido, Northern Japan is presented as a case study.

Yet, this assumption has seldom been tested. In the past, the difficulties associated with following the fate of individual larvae through the pelagic phase have precluded such analyses. Here, we used field estimates of reproduction combined with DNA profiling of all members of a wild population of the panda anemonefish (Amphiprion polymnus) over two consecutive years to investigate (1) the predictors of egg production and (2) the predictors of the number of recruits produced. We found that across one and two life history transitions, female size was a significant predictor of egg production, and egg production was a significant predictor of the number of recruits produced (when controlling for farness) respectively. When looking across three life history transitions, we found that large females and couples where no male replacement occurred were more likely to produce at least one recruit that settled within the local population than small females or females where the original male died and was replaced. However, we found no evidence supporting the hypothesis that larger females contributed numerically more recruits than smaller ones to local replenishment. These findings provide the first support for the common assumption that egg production is correlated with recruit production. They also suggest that the duration of partnership in anemonefishes couples might be an important factor in their population dynamics.","[Saenz-Agudelo, Pablo; Planes, Serge] Univ Perpignan, USR Lab Excellence CORAIL 3278, CNRS EPHE, CRIOBE Ctr Biol & Ecol Trop & Mediterranneenne, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Saenz-Agudelo, Pablo] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Ciencias Ambientales & Evolut, Valdivia, Chile; [Jones, Geoffrey P.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Thorrold, Simon R.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Biol Dept MS 50, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",11,10.1007/s00227-014-2556-x,2015

Juveniles of some species show great flexibility in habitat use while other species rely heavily on a restricted number of juvenile habitats for protection and food. Considering the rapid degradation of coastal marine habitats worldwide, it is important to evaluate which species are more susceptible to loss of juvenile nursery habitats and how this differs across large biogeographic regions. Here we used a meta-analysis approach to investigate habitat use by juvenile reef fish species in tropical coastal ecosystems across the globe. Densities of juvenile fish species were compared among mangrove, seagrass and coral reef habitats. In the Caribbean, the majority of species showed significantly higher juvenile densities in mangroves as compared to seagrass beds and coral reefs, while for the Indo-Pacific region seagrass beds harbored the highest overall densities. Further analysis indicated that differences in tidal amplitude, irrespective of biogeographic region, appeared to be the major driver for this phenomenon. In addition, juvenile reef fish use of mangroves increased with increasing water salinity. In the Caribbean, species of specific families (e.g. Lutjanidae, Haemulidae) showed a higher reliance on mangroves or seagrass beds as juvenile habitats than other species, whereas in the Indo-Pacific family-specific trends of juvenile habitat utilization were less apparent. The findings of this study highlight the importance of incorporating region-specific tidal inundation regimes into marine spatial conservation planning and ecosystem based management. Furthermore, the significant role of water salinity and tidal access as drivers of mangrove fish habitat use implies that changes in seawater level and rainfall due to climate change may have important effects on how juvenile reef fish use nearshore seascapes in the future.","[Igulu, Mathias M.; Nagelkerken, Ivan; Dorenbosch, Martijn; Grol, Monique G.

This assumption is based on research from the terrestrial environment and theoretical evolutionary modelling. We test this assumption in the marine environment by analysing the mitochondrial genetic diversity of 33 coral reef fish species from five families sampled from Pacific Ocean archipelagos. Surprisingly, haplotype and nucleotide diversity did not differ significantly between endemic and widespread species. The probable explanation is that the effective population size of some widespread fishes locally is similar to that of many of the endemics. Connectivity across parts of the distribution of the widespread species is probably low, so widespread species can operate like endemics at the extreme or isolated parts of their range.

Ecosystem service assessments, intended to influence the decisions people make regarding their interactions with nature, need to understand how people benefit from different ecosystem services. A critical question is therefore, What determines the distribution of ecosystem service benefits between different sections of society? Here, we use an entitlements approach to examine how people perceive ecosystem service benefits across 28 coral reef fishing communities in four countries. In doing so, we quantitatively show that bundles of benefits are mediated by key access mechanisms (e.g., rights-based, economic, knowledge, social, and institutional). We find that specific access mechanisms influence which ecosystem services people prioritize. Social, institutional, and knowledge mechanisms are associated with the largest number and diversity of benefits. However, local context strongly determines whether specific access mechanisms enable or constrain benefits. Local ecological knowledge enabled people to prioritize a habitat benefit in Kenya, but constrained people from prioritizing the same benefit in Madagascar. Ecosystem service assessments, and their resultant policies, need to include the broad suite of access mechanisms that enable different people to benefit from a supply of ecosystem services.","[Hicks, Christina C.; Cinner, Joshua E.] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Hicks, Christina C.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Ocean Solut, Monterey, CA 93940 USA",34,10.1073/pnas.1413473111,2014

Recently, coral bleaching, which often results in mass mortality of corals and the collapse of coral reef ecosystems, has become an important issue around the world as coral reefs decrease in number year after year. To understand the mechanisms underlying coral bleaching, we maintained two species of scleractinian corals (Acroporidae) in aquaria under non-thermal stress (27 degrees C) and moderate thermal stress conditions (30 degrees C), and we compared the numbers and conditions of the expelled Symbiodinium from these corals. Under non-thermal stress conditions corals actively expel a degraded form of Symbiodinium, which are thought to be digested by their host coral. This response was also observed at 30 degrees C. However, while the expulsion rates of Symbiodinium cells remained constant, the proportion of degraded cells significantly increased at 30 degrees C. This result indicates that corals more actively digest and expel damaged Symbiodinium under thermal stress conditions, likely as a mechanism for coping with environmental change. However, the increase in digested Symbiodinium expulsion under thermal stress may not fully keep up with accumulation of the damaged cells. There are more photosynthetically damaged Symbiodinium upon prolonged exposure to thermal stress, and corals release them without digestion to prevent their accumulation. This response may be an adaptive strategy to moderate stress to ensure survival, but the accumulation of damaged Symbiodinium, which causes subsequent coral deterioration, may occur when the response cannot cope with the magnitude or duration of environmental stress, and this might be a possible mechanism underlying coral bleaching during prolonged moderate thermal stress.","[Fujise, Lisa; Liao, Lawrence M.; Koike, Kazuhiko] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Biosphere Sci, Higashihiroshima, Hiroshima 724, Japan; [Yamashita, Hiroshi; Suzuki, Go] Fisheries Res Agcy, Seikai Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Res Ctr Subtrop Fisheries, Ishigaki, Okinawa, Japan; [Sasaki, Kengo] Western Reg Ind Res Ctr, Higashihiroshima, Hiroshima, Japan",20,10.1371/journal.pone.0114321,2014

Plakortis sp. 1 from the Bahamas associates exclusively with Xestospongia deweerdtae which was originally described living freely on the deep fore-reef and caves of Jamaica. In addition, we found Plakortis sp. 2 from Puerto Rico which associates with both X. deweerdtae and a different Xestospongia sp. Sponge specimens were identified using cytochrome oxidase subunit 1, 28S rRNA and 18S rRNA gene sequence fragments, spicule analysis, and histological sections with SEM. Unlike previous sponge pairs, Xestospongia spp. not only grew as a thin veneer of tissue over the Plakortis host sponge but through the mesohyl, forming inner channels (0.1-1 cm) that may provide a benefit by facilitating more efficient water transport through the dense Plakortis tissue. Symbioses with both Plakortis spp. were documented from an early recruit stage through adulthood. Spicule measurements conducted on symbiotic versus free-living X. deweerdtae revealed significantly smaller spicule sizes for symbiotic individuals, suggesting a cost in terms of silicon availability, or a benefit in terms of a lower investment in skeleton synthesis for support. This study reveals new specialized symbiotic associations between distantly related sponge genera that likely represent an alternative strategy of adaptation for life in reef caves and mesophotic reefs.","[Vicente, Jan; Powell, Ryan J.; Hill, Russell T.] Univ Maryland, Inst Marine & Environm Technol, Ctr Environm Sci, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA; [Zea, Sven] Univ Nacl Colombia, INVEMAR, CECIMAR, Ctr Estudios Ciencias Mar, Rodadero Sur Playa Salgu, Santa Marta, Colombia; [Pawlik, Joseph R.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol & Marine Biol, Ctr Marine Sci, Wilmington, NC 28409 USA",7,10.1007/s00227-014-2546-z,2014

On coral reefs, particularly the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), little is known regarding the distribution of sharks across major reef habitat types. In this study, we surveyed shark populations across outer-shelf reefs of the GBR in order to determine the diversity, abundance, and distribution of reef sharks across three major coral reef habitats: (1) the reef slope, (2) the back reef and (3) the reef flat. Model selection revealed that habitat was the principal factor influencing shark distribution and abundance. Specifically, overall shark abundance and diversity were significantly higher on the reef slope (and to a lesser degree, the back reef) than the reef flat. This confirms that shark populations are not homogeneously distributed across coral reefs. Thus, the results presented herein have important implications for shark population assessments. In addition, our results highlight the potential importance of the reef slope, with high levels of live coral cover and structural complexity, for sustaining reef shark populations.

These results suggest that S. tubifer uses various environmental cues for homing and site fidelity; similar behaviors and cues might be used by larvae for recruitment to settlement sites and for the acquisition of luminous symbiotic bacteria.","[Gould, Alison L.; Dunlap, Paul V.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Harii, Saki] Univ Ryukyus, Trop Biosphere Res Ctr, Sesoko Stn, Motobu, Okinawa 9050227, Japan",7,10.1007/s00227-014-2554-z,2014

In particular, parrotfishes (Family Labridae) represent a ubiquitous and ecologically important group that is increasingly prevalent in commercial and artisanal fisheries worldwide. We used both fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data to examine the effect of life histories on vulnerability to overexploitation in parrotfishes. Vulnerability for each species was derived from independent measures associated with both temporal (20-year catch records) and spatial datasets. Most life-history traits examined were significant predictors of vulnerability across species, but their relative utility differed considerably. Length-based traits (e.g., lengths at maturity and sex change, maximum length) were generally superior to age-based traits (e.g., life span), but one age-based trait, age at female maturation, was the best predictor. The results suggest that easily derived metrics such as maximum length can be effective measures of sensitivity to exploitation when applied to phylogenetically related multispecies assemblages, but more holistic and comprehensive age-based demographic data should be sought, especially in data-deficient and heavily impacted regions. Given the increasing prevalence of parrotfishes in the global coral reef harvest, species-specific responses demonstrate the capacity for heavy fishing pressure to alter parrotfish assemblages considerably.","[Taylor, Brett M.; Russ, Garry R.; Choat, J.

During this period, a mass recruitment of age-0 C. striatus occurred in March 2002 with numbers reaching 22.9 recruits m(-2). This program provided an invaluable opportunity to (1) analyze the dynamics of a mass recruitment episode and to assess its significance with respect to more typical patterns of recruitment and (2) establish the pattern of recruit growth during their first year of life. Age-based analysis indicated that the mass recruitment generated about 90 % of annual recruitment, but recruit mortality was high; thus, most recruitment was provided by continuous settlement throughout the year. The mass event appeared to be a short-lived pulse with recruits residing on the reef an average of 14.1 d compared with 161.1 d for other recruits. Recruits grew rapidly, achieving 90 % of their adult size during their first year, and they formed their first otolith annulus after 1 yr, thereby providing a firm basis for otolith interpretation of fish ages during the early life history phase of this species. The extensive age-based documentation of their first year growth in this study validates the distinctive ""square"" growth pattern exhibited by acanthurids as described in the literature (i.e., long life span with rapid initial growth that quickly reaches an asymptotic size), and it demonstrates the impact that the presence of age-0 fish has when generating growth parameters for populations exhibiting square growth. We found that the parameters from the re-parameterized von Bertalanffy growth function have preferred characteristics when modeling square growth in fish and that fixing age-at-length zero to pelagic larval duration is a preferable method to constrain growth models when lacking age-0 fish.","[Trip, Elizabeth D.

However, the role of habitat degradation and resource specialisation in explaining local extinction is unknown. On coral reefs, coral bleaching is an increasingly frequent cause of coral mortality that can result in dramatic changes to coral community composition. Coral-associated fishes are often specialised on a limited suite of coral species and are therefore sensitive to these changes. This study documents the local extinction of a corallivorous reef fish, Oxymonacanthus longirostris, following a mass bleaching event that altered the species composition of associated coral communities. Local extinction only occurred on reefs that also completely lost a key prey species, Acropora millepora, even though coral cover remained high. In an experimental test, fish continued to select bleached A. millepora over the healthy, but less-preferred prey species that resisted bleaching. These results suggest that behavioural inflexibility may limit the ability of specialists to cope with even subtle changes to resource availability.","[Brooker, R. M.; Munday, P. L.; Brandl, S.

In the Caribbean, trophic subsidies from habitats adjacent to coral reefs support the diet of reef fishes, but it is not known whether similar trophic links occur on reefs in the Indo-Pacific. Here, we test whether reef fishes in inshore coral, mangrove, and seagrass habitats are supported by trophic links. We used carbon stable isotopes and mathematical mixing models to determine the minimum proportion of resources from mangrove or seagrass habitats in the diet of five fish species from coral reefs at varying distances (0-2,200 m) from these habitats in Moreton Bay, Queensland, eastern Australia. Of the fish species that are more abundant on reefs near to mangroves, Lutjanus russelli and Acanthopagrus australis showed no minimum use of diet sources from mangrove habitat. Siganus fuscescens utilized a minimum of 25-44 % mangrove sources and this contribution increased with the proximity of reefs to mangroves (R (2) = 0.91). Seagrass or reef flat sources contributed a minimum of 14-78 % to the diet of Diagramma labiosum, a species found in higher abundance on reefs near seagrass beds, but variation in diet among reefs was unrelated to seascape structure. Seagrass or reef flat sources also contributed a minimum of 8-55 % to a fish species found only on reefs (Pseudolabrus guentheri), indicating that detrital subsidies from these habitats may subsidize fish diet on reefs. These results suggest that carbon sources from multiple habitats contribute to the functioning of inshore coral reef ecosystems and that trophic connectivity between reefs and mangroves may enhance production of a functionally important herbivore.","[Davis, Jean P.; Pitt, Kylie A.; Olds, Andrew D.; Connolly, Rod M.] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst Coast & Estuaries, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia; [Davis, Jean P.; Pitt, Kylie A.; Olds, Andrew D.; Connolly, Rod M.] Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia; [Fry, Brian] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst Coast & Estuaries, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Fry, Brian] Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Olds, Andrew D.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Sci & Engn, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia",21,10.1007/s00338-014-1196-4,2014

Because coral reefs exist in environments commonly impacted by multiple stressors simultaneously, understanding their interactions is of particular importance. To evaluate the role of multiple stressors we experimentally manipulated three stressors (herbivore abundance, nutrient supply, and sediment loading) in plots on a natural reef in the Gulf of Panama in the Eastern Tropical Pacific. Monitoring of the benthic community (coral, macroalgae, algal turf, and crustose coralline algae) showed complex responses with all three stressors impacting the community, but at different times, in different combinations, and with varying effects on different community members. Reduction of top-down control in combination with sediment addition had the strongest effect on the community, and led to approximately three times greater algal biomass. Coral cover was reduced in all experimental units with a negative effect of nutrients over time and a synergistic interaction between herbivore exclosures and sediment addition. In contrast, nutrient and sediment additions interacted antagonistically in their impacts on crustose coralline algae and turf algae so that in combination the treatments limited each other's effects. Interactions between stressors and temporal variability indicated that, while each stressor had the potential to impact community structure, their combinations and the broader environmental conditions under which they acted strongly influenced their specific effects. Thus, it is critical to evaluate the effects of stressors on community dynamics not only independently but also under different combinations or environmental conditions to understand how those effects will be played out in more realistic scenarios.","[Muthukrishnan, Ranjan; Fong, Peggy] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Muthukrishnan, Ranjan] Univ Minnesota, Dept Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Minneapolis, MN USA",19,10.1007/s00338-014-1199-1,2014

In this study, we applied Calcein fluorescent dyes as time indicators within the skeleton of coral colonies (n = 3) of Porites astreoides and Diploria strigosa at three study sites distributed across the northern Bermuda coral reef platform. We evaluated the correlation between seasonal average growth rates based on coral density and extension rates with average temperature, light, and seawater Omega (arag) in an effort to decipher the relative importance of each parameter. The results show significant seasonal differences among coral calcification rates ranging from summer maximums of 243 +/- A 58 and 274 +/- A 57 mmol CaCO3 m(-2) d(-1) to winter minimums of 135 +/- A 39 and 101 +/- A 34 mmol CaCO3 m(-2) d(-1) for P. astreoides and D. strigosa, respectively. We also placed small coral colonies (n = 10) in transparent chambers and measured the instantaneous rate of calcification under light and dark treatments at the same study sites. The results showed that the skeletal growth of D. strigosa and P. astreoides, whether hourly or seasonal, was highly sensitive to Omega (arag). We believe this high sensitivity, however, is misleading, due to covariance between light and Omega (arag), with the former being the strongest driver of calcification variability. For the seasonal data, we assessed the impact that the observed seasonal differences in temperature (4.0 A degrees C), light (5.1 mol photons m(-2) d(-1)), and Omega (arag) (0.16 units) would have on coral growth rates based on established relationships derived from laboratory studies and found that they could account for approximately 44, 52, and 5 %, respectively, of the observed seasonal change of 81 +/- A 14 mmol CaCO3 m(-2) d(-1).

However, it is largely unknown (1) how much N-2 is actually fixed by turf communities and (2) which factors affect their N-2 fixation rates. Therefore, we compared N-2 fixation activity by turf communities at different depths and during day and night-time on a degraded versus a less degraded coral reef site on the island of Cura double dagger ao. N-2 fixation rates measured with the acetylene reduction assay were slightly higher in shallow (5-10-m depth) than in deep turf communities (30-m depth), and N-2 fixation rates during the daytime significantly exceeded those during the night. N-2 fixation rates by the turf communities did not differ between the degraded and less degraded reef. Both our study and a literature survey of earlier studies indicated that turf communities tend to have lower N-2 fixation rates than cyanobacterial mats. However, at least in our study area, turf communities were more abundant than cyanobacterial mats. Our results therefore suggest that turf communities play an important role in the nitrogen cycle of coral reefs. N-2 fixation by turfs may contribute to an undesirable positive feedback that promotes the proliferation of algal turf communities while accelerating coral reef degradation.","[den Haan, Joost; Visser, Petra M.; Ganase, Anjani E.; Stal, Lucas J.; Vermeij, Mark J.

While changes in the underwater light field and the ability to associate with different photosynthetic symbionts of the genus Symbiodinium explain some of the variation, the limits to physiological plasticity are unknown for most corals. In the central Red Sea, colonies of the branching coral Pocillopora verrucosa are most abundant in shallow high light environments and become less abundant in water depths below 10 m. To further understand what determines this narrow distribution, we conducted a cross-depths transplant experiment looking at physiological plasticity and acclimation in regard to depth. Colonies from 5, 10, and 20 m were collected, transplanted to all depths, and re-investigated after 30 and 210 d. All coral colonies transplanted downward from shallow to deep water displayed an increase in photosynthetic light-harvesting pigments, which resulted in higher photosynthetic efficiency. Shallow-water specimens transplanted to deeper water showed a significant decrease in total protein content after 30 and 210 d under low light conditions compared to specimens transplanted to shallow and medium depths. Stable isotope data suggest that heterotrophic input of carbon was not increased under low light, and consequently, decreasing protein levels were symptomatic of decreasing photosynthetic rates that could not be compensated for through higher light-harvesting efficiency. Our results provide insights into the physiological plasticity of P. verrucosa in changing light regimes and explain the observed depth distribution pattern. Despite its high abundance in shallow reef waters, P. verrucosa possesses limited heterotrophic acclimation potential, i.e., the ability to support its mainly photoautotrophic diet through heterotrophic feeding. We conclude that P. verrucosa might be a species vulnerable to sudden changes in underwater light fields resulting from processes such as increased turbidity caused by coastal development along the Saudi Arabian Red Sea coast.","[Ziegler, Maren; Buechel, Claudia] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Mol Biosci, Dept Biosci, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Ziegler, Maren] Senckenberg Res Inst, LOEWE Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Roder, Cornelia M.; Voolstra, Christian R.] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia",19,10.1007/s00338-014-1192-8,2014

We used micropredator attracting devices (MADs) and stable isotope analyses to provide insights into the distribution and diet of H. carunculata in a coral reef on Cura double dagger ao, southern Caribbean. MADs consisted of algal clumps inside accessible mesh nets which H. carunculata could use as refuge. To obtain indications on its distribution pattern, MADs filled with Halimeda opuntia were deployed in different reef habitats ranging from 0 to 16 m water depth. Fireworms were found inside MADs in all reef habitats, indicating that they have a widespread horizontal and vertical distribution, ranging from the shoreline to the deeper reef slope. On the reef crest, MADs were filled using different algal species and deployed on dead or live scleractinian corals. MADs hosted more fireworms when placed on live corals, regardless of algal species used, suggesting that algal-induced corallivory may be widespread. To test for food preferences, different food sources were added inside the MADs. Fireworms detected potential prey within 6 h and were significantly more attracted by decaying corals and raw fish than by live corals, hydrozoans, or gorgonians. Stable isotope analyses indicated detritus, macroalgae, and scleractinian corals as potential food sources and revealed an ontogenetic dietary shift toward enriched delta C-13 and delta N-15 values with increasing fireworm size, suggesting that large-sized individuals feed on food sources of higher trophic levels. Our findings highlight H. carunculata as a widespread, and omnivorous scavenger that has the potential to switch feeding toward weakened or stressed corals, thereby likely acting as a harmful corallivore on degraded reefs.","[Wolf, Alexander T.; Nugues, Maggy M.; Wild, Christian] Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Ecol ZMT, Coral Reef Ecol Grp CORE, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Nugues, Maggy M.] CNRS EPHE UPVD, Lab Excellence CORAIL, CRIOBE USR 3278, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Nugues, Maggy M.] Caribbean Res & Management Biodivers CARMABI, Willemstad, Curacao, Neth Antilles; [Wild, Christian] Univ Bremen, Fac Biol & Chem, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",9,10.1007/s00338-014-1184-8,2014

This is the first comprehensive, large-scale study, of the influence of an offshore reef system on wave climate and wave transmission. The focus was on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, utilizing a 16-yr record of wave height from seven satellite altimeters. Within the GBR matrix, the wave climate is not strongly dependent on reef matrix submergence. This suggests that after initial wave breaking at the seaward edge of the reef matrix, wave energy that penetrates the matrix has little depth modulation. There is no clear evidence to suggest that as reef matrix porosity (ratio of spaces between individual reefs to reef area) decreases, wave attenuation increases. This is because individual reefs cast a wave shadow much larger than the reef itself; thus, a matrix of isolated reefs is remarkably effective at attenuating wave energy. This weak dependence of transmitted wave energy on depth of reef submergence, and reef matrix porosity, is also evident in the lee of the GBR matrix. Here, wave conditions appear to be dependent largely on local wind speed, rather than wave conditions either seaward, or within the reef matrix. This is because the GBR matrix is a very effective wave absorber, irrespective of water depth and reef matrix porosity.","[Gallop, Shari L.; Haigh, Ivan D.] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; [Young, Ian R.; Ranasinghe, Roshanka] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Ranasinghe, Roshanka] UNESCO IHE, Dept Water Engn, NL-2601 DA Delft, Netherlands; [Ranasinghe, Roshanka] Deltares, Harbour Coastal & Ocean Engn, NL-2600 MH Delft, Netherlands; [Durrant, Tom H.] Bur Meteorol, Ctr Weather & Climate Res, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [Haigh, Ivan D.] Univ Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, Sch Civil Environm & Min Engn, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",11,10.1007/s00338-014-1205-7,2014

Current research points to the value of CWC as a habitat for commercially interesting species, which motivates management of these resources to include a more comprehensive set of mechanisms, such as placing incentives to encourage a change of gear from bottom trawling to less destructive methods in less densely covered CWC areas, and possibly a stronger focus on other benthic habitats that are equally or more valuable, such as sponges.

Due to their lower ambient temperatures, they are regarded as potential refugia for tropical species shifting poleward due to rising sea temperatures. However, acute warming events can cause rapid shifts in the composition of high-latitude reef communities, including range contractions of temperate macroalgae and bleaching-induced mortality in corals. While bleaching has been reported on numerous high-latitude reefs, post-bleaching trajectories of benthic communities are poorly described. Consequently, the longer-term effects of thermal anomalies on high-latitude reefs are difficult to predict. Here, we use an autonomous underwater vehicle to conduct repeated surveys of three 625 m(2) plots on a coral-dominated high-latitude reef in the Houtman Abrolhos Islands, Western Australia, over a four-year period spanning a large-magnitude thermal anomaly. Quantification of benthic communities revealed high coral cover (>70%, comprising three main morphospecies) prior to the bleaching event. Plating Montipora was most susceptible to bleaching, but in the plot where it was most abundant, coral cover did not change significantly because of post-bleaching increases in branching Acropora. In the other two plots, coral cover decreased while macroalgal cover increased markedly. Overall, coral cover declined from 73% to 59% over the course of the study, while macroalgal cover increased from 11% to 24%. The significant differences in impacts and post-bleaching trajectories among plots underline the importance of understanding the underlying causes of such variation to improve predictions of how climate change will affect reefs, especially at high-latitudes.","[Bridge, Tom C.

In this study, net community calcification and production were measured on a coral reef flat at One Tree Island, Great Barrier Reef, using Lagrangian flow respirometry and slack water methods. Net community calcification, daytime net photosynthesis and nighttime respiration were higher under the flow respirometry method, likely due to increased water flow relative to the slack water method. The two methods also varied in the degrees to which they were influenced by potential measurement uncertainties. The difference in the results from these two commonly used methods implies that some of the location-specific differences in coral reef community metabolism may be due to differences in measurement methods.","[Shaw, Emily C.; Phinn, Stuart R.] Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Tilbrook, Bronte] CSIRO, Oceans & Atmosphere Flagship, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Steven, Andy] CSIRO, Oceans & Atmosphere Flagship, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",9,10.1371/journal.pone.0112161,2014

Marine reserves are a popular tool for managing coastal ecosystems and resources yet surprisingly few studies have quantified the social-economic impacts of marine reserves on food security despite the critical importance of this outcome for fisheries management in developing countries. Here, I conducted semi-structured household surveys with 113 women heads-of-households to investigate the influence of two old, well-enforced, no-take marine reserves on food security in four coastal fishing communities in Kenya, East Africa. Multi-model information-theoretic inference and matching methods found that marine reserves did not influence household food security, as measured by protein consumption, diet diversity and food coping strategies. Instead, food security was strongly influenced by fishing livelihoods and household wealth: fishing families and wealthier households were more food secure than non-fishing and poorer households. These findings highlight the importance of complex social and economic landscapes of livelihoods, urbanization, power and gender dynamics that can drive the outcomes of marine conservation and management.","[Darling, Emily S.] Simon Fraser Univ, Earth Ocean Res Grp, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Darling, Emily S.] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Mombasa, Kenya",10,10.1371/journal.pone.0113614,2014

Traditionally, such estimates were based on rates of sedimentation measured with sediment traps or in deep sea cores. Here we estimated CaCO3 precipitation rates in the surface water of the Red Sea from total alkalinity depletion along their axial flow using the water flux in the straits of Bab el Mandeb. The relative contribution of coral reefs and open sea plankton were calculated by fitting a Rayleigh distillation model to the increase in the strontium to calcium ratio. We estimate the net amount of CaCO3 precipitated in the Red Sea to be 7.3 +/- 0.4.10(10) kg.y(-1) of which 80 +/- 5% is by pelagic calcareous plankton and 20 +/- 5% is by the flourishing coastal coral reefs. This estimate for pelagic calcification rate is up to 40% higher than published sedimentary CaCO3 accumulation rates for the region. The calcification rate of the Gulf of Aden was estimated by the Rayleigh model to be similar to 1/2 of the Red Sea, and in the northwestern Indian Ocean, it was smaller than our detection limit. The results of this study suggest that variations of major ions on a basin scale may potentially help in assessing long-term effects of ocean acidification on carbonate deposition by marine organisms.","[Steiner, Zvi; Erez, Jonathan; Katz, Amitai; Lazar, Boaz] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fredy & Nadine Herrmann Inst Earth Sci, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Steiner, Zvi; Erez, Jonathan; Lazar, Boaz] Interuniv Inst Marine Sci, IL-88103 Elat, Israel; [Shemesh, Aldo; Yam, Ruth] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel",9,10.1073/pnas.1414323111,2014

We found that extracellular gross photosynthetic O-2 evolution was unchanged under different spectral illumination, while the more red-weighted halogen lamp spectrum decreased PSII electron transport rates and there was a trend towards increased light-enhanced dark respiration rates under excess irradiance. The approach provided here allows for reconstructing and comparing intra-tissue coral light fields and other complex spectral compositions of incident irradiance.

We recorded seasonal changes in the structure of tropical macroalgae fields within the Ningaloo lagoon (Western Australia) and related this to the density, biomass and species richness of fishes that represent key processes: juveniles, predators of juveniles and herbivores. The extent and direction of seasonal changes in macroalgae were inconsistent among sites, creating a highly dynamic habitat matrix across time and space. Species richness and density of fishes were largely maintained where density of holdfasts from canopy-forming macroalgae and/or cover was high across seasons, but shifted markedly in areas of macroalgae habitat loss: suggesting stable habitat structure is critical for the persistence of macroalgae-associated fishes. Our results demonstrate that macroalgae fields that maintain high structural complexity across different seasons are more likely to preserve key ecological processes and therefore warrant greater conservation attention within a spatial management framework.","[Wilson, S.

This study documents the temporal periodicity of two common resident predators of juvenile reef fishes, Cephalopholis cyanostigma (rockcod) and Pseudochromis fuscus (dottyback) and compares these to the activity and foraging pattern of a common prey species, juvenile Pomacentrus moluccensis (lemon damselfish). Detailed observations of activity in the field and using 24 h infrared video in the laboratory revealed that the two predators had very different activity patterns. C. cyanostigma was active over the whole 24 h period, with a peak in feeding strikes at dusk and increased activity at both dawn and dusk, while P. fuscus was not active at night and had its highest strike rates at midday. The activity and foraging pattern of P. moluccensis directly opposes that of C. cyanostigma with individuals reducing strike rate and intraspecific aggression at both dawn and dusk, and reducing distance from shelter and boldness at dusk only. Juveniles examined were just outside the size-selection window of P. fuscus. We suggest that the relatively predictable diel behaviour of coral reef predators results from physiological factors such as visual sensory abilities, circadian rhythmicity, variation in hunting profitability, and predation risk at different times of the day. Our study suggests that the diel periodicity of P. moluccensis behaviour may represent a response to increased predation risk at times when both the ability to efficiently capture food and visually detect predators is reduced.","[McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",9,10.1371/journal.pone.0111723,2014

Here, we demonstrate how the farming damselfish Stegastes marginatus plays a dual role in benthic structuring by 1) contributing to persistence of the invasive macroalga Acanthophora spicifera within a Hawaiian marine protected area, where the macroalga occurred exclusively inside Stegastes territories, and 2) behaving as an opportunistic browser of the exotic alga outside their territorial borders. Greater than 50% of the biomass of tethered A. spicifera was consumed within one-hour when placed outside Stegastes territories, compared to <5% lost from tethers within territories or herbivore exclusion cages. In situ remote video revealed that tethered A. spicifera located outside territories was grazed primarily by the surgeonfish Acanthurus nigrofuscus (similar to 68% of total bites) and, surprisingly, by S. marginatus (similar to 27% of total bites) that left their territories to feed on this resource on 107 occasions during 400 min of filming. Further, for over half of those occurrences where S. marginatus grazed on the tethered macroalga outside of territories, they fed alongside conspecifics and other species, displaying little of the aggressiveness that characterizes this damselfish. These results show that S. marginatus plays a wider role in determining benthic assemblages than previously recognized, acting both as cultivators of a canopy-forming invasive macroalga within their territories, and as opportunistic browsers in neighboring sites. Consequently, S. marginatus can affect benthic species composition across their territory borders. These results provide a rare example of interspecific facilitation of an exotic alga by an indigenous marine fish. Accounting for fish behaviors more broadly is important to further our understanding of ecological processes that shape reef ecosystems to improve management of MPAs that often support extensive farming damselfish populations.","[Peyton, Kimberly A.; Valentino, Lauren M.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI USA; [Maruska, Karen P.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",2,10.1371/journal.pone.0109007,2014

This study examines asexual propagation as a method for culturing a geographically widespread and commonly traded species of host sea anemone, Entacmaea quadricolor. Two experiments were done: the first to establish whether size or colour morph influenced survival after cutting into halves or quarters; and the second to see whether feeding was needed to maximise survival and growth after cutting. Survival rates were high in both experiments, with 89.3 and 93.8% of the anemones cut in half, and 62.5 and 80.4% cut in quarters surviving in experiments 1 and 2, respectively. Anemones that were cut in half were larger in size, and healed and grew quicker than those cut in quarters. However, even though survival was lower when the individuals were cut in quarters, this treatment produced the greatest number of anemones. Feeding increased oral disc diameter growth and reduced wet weight loss, but did not significantly influence pedal disc diameter. Given that the anemones took up to 56 d to form an off-centre mouth, it is highly likely that feeding may have produced greater effect if the experiment was run for longer. This low technology method of propagation could be used to produce individuals throughout the year and the anemones could then be used to supply the aquarium trade or restock depleted habitats, thus supporting biodiversity conservation in coral reef areas.","[Scott, Anna] Southern Cross Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Natl Marine Sci Ctr, Coffs Harbour, NSW, Australia; Southern Cross Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Marine Ecol Res Ctr, Coffs Harbour, NSW, Australia",4,10.1371/journal.pone.0109566,2014

Cell proliferation was determined through the incorporation of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and measuring the percentage of BrdU-positive cells after 6 h of continuous labeling (10 h for Chondrosia reniformis). Apoptosis was identified using an antibody against active caspase-3. Cell loss through shedding was studied quantitatively by collecting and weighing sponge-expelled detritus and qualitatively by light microscopy of sponge tissue and detritus. All species investigated displayed substantial cell proliferation, predominantly in the choanoderm, but also in the mesohyl. The majority of coral reef species (five) showed between 16.1 +/- 15.9% and 19.0 +/- 2.0% choanocyte proliferation (mean +/- SD) after 6 h and the Mediterranean species, C. reniformis, showed 16.6 +/- 3.2% after 10 h BrdU-labeling. Monanchora arbuscula showed lower choanocyte proliferation (8.1 +/- 3.7%), whereas the mangrove species Mycale microsigmatosa showed relatively higher levels of choanocyte proliferation (70.5 +/- 6.6%). Choanocyte proliferation in Haliclona vansoesti was variable (2.8-73.1%). Apoptosis was negligible and not the primary mechanism of cell loss involved in cell turnover. All species investigated produced significant amounts of detritus (2.5-18% detritus bodyweight(-1) d(-1)) and cell shedding was observed in seven out of eight species. The amount of shed cells observed in histological sections may be related to differences in residence time of detritus within canals. Detritus production could not be directly linked to cell shedding due to the degraded nature of expelled cellular debris. We have demonstrated that under steady-state conditions, cell turnover through cell proliferation and cell shedding are common processes to maintain tissue homeostasis in a variety of sponge species from different ecosystems. Cell turnover is hypothesized to be the main underlying mechanism producing sponge-derived detritus, a major trophic resource transferred through sponges in benthic ecosystems, such as coral reefs.","[Alexander, Brittany E.; Liebrand, Kevin; van der Geest, Harm G.; Admiraal, Wim; de Goeij, Jasper M.] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Aquat Ecol & Ecotoxicol, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Alexander, Brittany E.; Osinga, Ronald; de Goeij, Jasper M.] Porifarma BV Poelbos 3, Ede, Netherlands; [Cleutjens, Jack P.

To evaluate the capacity of reef corals to persist over various time scales, we examined coral community dynamics in contemporary, fossil, and simulated future coral reef ecosystems. Based on studies between 1987 and 2012 at two locations in the Caribbean, and between 1981 and 2013 at five locations in the Indo-Pacific, we show that many coral genera declined in abundance, some showed no change in abundance, and a few coral genera increased in abundance. Whether the abundance of a genus declined, increased, or was conserved, was independent of coral family. An analysis of fossil-reef communities in the Caribbean revealed changes in numerical dominance and relative abundances of coral genera, and demonstrated that neither dominance nor taxon was associated with persistence. As coral family was a poor predictor of performance on contemporary reefs, a trait-based, dynamic, multi-patch model was developed to explore the phenotypic basis of ecological performance in a warmer future. Sensitivity analyses revealed that upon exposure to thermal stress, thermal tolerance, growth rate, and longevity were the most important predictors of coral persistence. Together, our results underscore the high variation in the rates and direction of change in coral abundances on contemporary and fossil reefs. Given this variation, it remains possible that coral reefs will be populated by a subset of the present coral fauna in a future that is warmer than the recent past.","[Edmunds, Peter J.; Carpenter, Robert C.; Jacobson, Lianne] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; [Adjeroud, Mehdi] Observ Oceanol Banyuls, Unite Rech CoReUs, Inst Rech Dev, Banyuls Sur Mer, France; [Adjeroud, Mehdi] Lab Excellence CORAIL, Perpignan, France; [Baskett, Marissa L.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Baums, Iliana B.] Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Budd, Ann F.] Univ Iowa, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Iowa City, IA USA; [Fabina, Nicholas S.] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Fan, Tung-Yung] Natl Museum Marine Biol & Aquarium, Checheng, Pingtung, Taiwan; [Franklin, Erik C.; Gates, Ruth D.] Univ Hawaii, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI USA; [Gross, Kevin] N Carolina State Univ, Biomath Program, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Han, Xueying] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Han, Xueying] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Coastal Res Ctr, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Han, Xueying; O'Leary, Jennifer K.] Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA USA; [Jacobson, Lianne] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL USA; [Klaus, James S.] Univ Miami, Dept Geol Sci, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [McClanahan, Tim R.] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Marine Program, Bronx, NY USA; [van Oppen, Madeleine J.

Despite being abundant on southwestern Atlantic reefs, sea urchin distributions, and their association with abiotic and biotic variables, are poorly known. In this study, sea urchin assemblages were surveyed in 2011 at multiple depths at eight sites in Arraial do Cabo (Brazil, 22A degrees 57'S/41A degrees 01'W), with sites split between a colder, more wave-exposed location, and a warmer, more sheltered location. The influence of this large-scale physical gradient, along with changes in depth and substrate complexity, on sea urchin densities was then investigated. Predator biomass was low and did not vary significantly among sites. Among the seven species recorded, Paracentrotus gaimardi, Echinometra lucunter and Arbacia lixula were dominant. Linear mixed-effects models indicated that location was important, with mid-sized P. gaimardi individuals and A. lixula more common at cooler, exposed sites and E. lucunter more abundant at warmer, sheltered sites. Sea urchin densities typically decreased with increasing depth, probably caused by changes in factors such as light, wave exposure, and sedimentation. Substrate complexity had a positive effect on the abundance of all species, presumably because of the increased availability of refuges. Physical gradients have important consequences for urchin distributions and their ecological functions at relatively small spatial scales on these reefs, and should be incorporated into herbivore monitoring programmes. Research is also required to examine how differential sea urchin distributions affect benthic dynamics.","[Cordeiro, C. A. M. M.; Ferreira, C. E.

Here, we examined the relative importance of local- and regional-scale factors structuring seagrass-associated fish assemblages, using a field survey in six seagrass (Thalassodendron ciliatum) areas around Unguja Island (Zanzibar, Tanzania). Fish density and assemblage structure were mostly affected by two regional-scale variables; distance to coral reefs, which positively affected fish density, and level of human development, which negatively affected fish density. On the local scale, seagrass biomass had a positive (but weaker) influence on fish density. However, the positive effect of seagrass biomass decreased with increasing level of human development. In summary, our results highlight the importance of assessing how multiple local and regional variables, alone and together, influence fish communities, in order to improve management of seagrass ecosystems and their services.","[Alonso Aller, Elisa; Gullstrom, Martin; Maarse, Floriaan K.

The BBD community is dominated by gliding, filamentous cyanobacteria with a highly diverse population of heterotrophic bacteria. Microbial interactions such as quorum sensing (QS) and antimicrobial production may be involved in BBD disease pathogenesis. In this study, BBD (whole community) samples, as well as 199 bacterial isolates from BBD, the surface mucopolysaccharide layer (SML) of apparently healthy corals, and SML of apparently healthy areas of BBD-infected corals were screened for the production of acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) and for autoinducer-2 (AI-2) activity using three bacterial reporter strains. AHLs were detected in all BBD (intact community) samples tested and in cultures of 5.5% of BBD bacterial isolates. Over half of a subset (153) of the isolates were positive for AI-2 activity. AHL-producing isolates were further analyzed using LC-MS/MS to determine AHL chemical structure and the concentration of (S)-4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD), the biosynthetic precursor of AI-2. C6-HSL was the most common AHL variant detected, followed by 3OC4-HSL. In addition to QS assays, 342 growth challenges were conducted among a subset of the isolates, with 27% of isolates eliciting growth inhibition and 2% growth stimulation. 24% of BBD isolates elicited growth inhibition as compared to 26% and 32% of the bacteria from the two SML sources. With one exception, only isolates that exhibited AI-2 activity or produced DPD inhibited growth of test strains. These findings demonstrate for the first time that AHLs are present in an active coral disease.

While environmental cycles and oceanography explain some patterns of replenishment, the role of other growth-related processes in influencing settlement and recruitment is less clear. Examination of a 65-mo. time series of recruitment of a common coral reef fish, Stegastes partitus, to the reefs of the upper Florida Keys revealed that during peak recruitment months, settlement stage larvae arriving during dark lunar phases grew faster as larvae and were larger at settlement compared to those settling during the light lunar phases. However, the strength and direction of early trait-mediated selective mortality also varied by settlement lunar phase such that the early life history traits of 2-4 week old recruit survivors that settled across the lunar cycle converged to more similar values. Similarly, within peak settlement periods, early life history traits of settling larvae and selective mortality of recruits varied by the magnitude of the settlement event: larvae settling in larger events had longer PLDs and consequently were larger at settlement than those settling in smaller pulses. Traits also varied by recruitment habitat: recruits surviving in live coral habitat (vs rubble) or areas with higher densities of adult conspecifics were those that were larger at settlement. Reef habitats, especially those with high densities of territorial conspecifics, are more challenging habitats for young fish to occupy and small settlers (due to lower larval growth and/or shorter PLDs) to these habitats have a lower chance of survival than they do in rubble habitats. Settling reef fish are not all equal and the time and location of settlement influences the likelihood that individuals will survive to contribute to the population.","[Rankin, Tauna L.; Sponaugle, Su] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Biol & Fisheries, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Rankin, Tauna L.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Off Habitat Conservat, Coral Reef Conservat Program, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Sponaugle, Su] Oregon State Univ, Hatfield Marine Sci Ctr, Dept Integrat Biol, Newport, OR 97365 USA",10,10.1371/journal.pone.0108871,2014

The aim of this paper is to conduct an ecosystem services valuation study for mangroves ecosystems, the results of which can be used to inform governance and management of mangroves. We used an expert-based participatory approach (the Delphi technique) to identify, categorize and rank the various ecosystem services provided by mangrove ecosystems at a global scale. Subsequently we looked for evidence in the existing ecosystem services literature for monetary valuations of these ecosystem service categories throughout the biogeographic distribution of mangroves. We then compared the relative ranking of ecosystem service categories between the monetary valuations and the expert based analysis. The experts identified 16 ecosystem service categories, six of which are not adequately represented in the literature. There was no significant correlation between the expert based valuation (the Delphi technique) and the economic valuation, indicating that the scope of valuation of ecosystem services needs to be broadened. Acknowledging this diversity in different valuation approaches, and developing methodological frameworks that foster the pluralism of values in ecosystem services research, are crucial for maintaining the credibility of ecosystem services valuation. To conclude, we use the findings of our dual approach to valuation to make recommendations on how to assess and manage the ecosystem services provided by mangrove ecosystems.","[Mukherjee, Nibedita; Huge, Jean; Dahdouh-Guebas, Farid] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Lab Syst Ecol & Resource Management, Brussels, Belgium; [Mukherjee, Nibedita; Koedam, Nico; Dahdouh-Guebas, Farid] Vrije Univ Brussel, Lab Plant Biol & Nat Management, Brussels, Belgium; [Sutherland, William J.; Dicks, Lynn] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Conservat Sci Grp, Cambridge, England; [Huge, Jean] Univ Ghent, Ctr Sustainable Dev, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",16,10.1371/journal.pone.0107706,2014

Measuring demographic connectivity between discreet populations remains a long-standing challenge for most marine organisms because it involves tracking the movement of pelagic larvae. Recent studies demonstrate local connectivity of reef fish populations via the dispersal of planktonic larvae, while biogeography indicates some larvae must disperse 100-1000 s kilometres. To date, empirical measures of long-distance dispersal are lacking and the full scale of dispersal is unknown. Here we provide the first measure of long-distance dispersal in a coral reef fish, the Omani clownfish Amphiprion omanensis, throughout its entire species range. Using genetic assignment tests we demonstrate bidirectional exchange of first generation migrants, with subsequent social and reproductive integration, between two populations separated by over 400 km. Immigration was 5.4% and 0.7% in each region, suggesting a biased southward exchange, and matched predictions from a physically-coupled dispersal model. This rare opportunity to measure long-distance dispersal demonstrates connectivity of isolated marine populations over distances of 100 s of kilometres and provides a unique insight into the processes of biogeography, speciation and adaptation.","[Simpson, Stephen D.] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter, Devon, England; [Harrison, Hugo B.] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Claereboudt, Michel R.] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Dept Marine Sci & Fisheries, Al Khoud, Oman; [Planes, Serge] Univ Perpignan, Ctr Biol & Ecol Trop & Mediterraneenne, F-66025 Perpignan, Pyrenees Orient, France; [Planes, Serge] Ctr Rech Insulaires & Observ Environm, Lab Excellence CORAIL, Moorea, Fr Polynesia",21,10.1371/journal.pone.0107610,2014

To date, this exchange has been assumed to be limited by molecular diffusion through an unstirred boundary layer extending 1-2 mm from the coral surface, with corals relying solely on external flow to overcome this limitation. Here, we present direct microscopic evidence that, instead, corals can actively enhance mass transport through strong vortical flows driven by motile epidermal cilia covering their entire surface. Ciliary beating produces quasi-steady arrays of counterrotating vortices that vigorously stir a layer of water extending up to 2 mm from the coral surface. We show that, under low ambient flow velocities, these vortices, rather than molecular diffusion, control the exchange of nutrients and oxygen between the coral and its environment, enhancing mass transfer rates by up to 400%. This ability of corals to stir their boundary layer changes the way that we perceive the microenvironment of coral surfaces, revealing an active mechanism complementing the passive enhancement of transport by ambient flow. These findings extend our understanding of mass transport processes in reef corals and may shed new light on the evolutionary success of corals and coral reefs.","[Shapiro, Orr H.; Fernandez, Vicente I.; Garren, Melissa; Guasto, Jeffrey S.; Debaillon-Vesque, Francois P.; Stocker, Roman] MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Shapiro, Orr H.; Kramarsky-Winter, Esti; Vardi, Assaf] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Plant Sci, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Guasto, Jeffrey S.] Tufts Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Debaillon-Vesque, Francois P.] Ecole Polytech, Dept Mech, F-91128 Palaiseau, France",41,10.1073/pnas.1323094111,2014

The present study examined shark distribution patterns, species-habitat associations, and marine reserve use with baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS) along the entire Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) over a ten year period. Overall, 21 species of sharks from five families and two orders were recorded. Grey reef Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, silvertip C. albimarginatus, tiger Galeocerdo cuvier, and sliteye Loxodon macrorhinus sharks were the most abundant species (>64% of shark abundances). Multivariate regression trees showed that hard coral cover produced the primary split separating shark assemblages. Four indicator species had consistently higher abundances and contributed to explaining most of the differences in shark assemblages: C. amblyrhynchos, C. albimarginatus, G. cuvier, and whitetip reef Triaenodon obesus sharks. Relative distance along the GBRMP had the greatest influence on shark occurrence and species richness, which increased at both ends of the sampling range (southern and northern sites) relative to intermediate latitudes. Hard coral cover and distance across the shelf were also important predictors of shark distribution. The relative abundance of sharks was significantly higher in non-fished sites, highlighting the conservation value and benefits of the GBRMP zoning. However, our results also showed that hard coral cover had a large effect on the abundance of reef-associated shark species, indicating that coral reef health may be important for the success of marine protected areas. Therefore, understanding shark distribution patterns, species-habitat associations, and the drivers responsible for those patterns is essential for developing sound management and conservation approaches.","[Espinoza, Mario; Heupel, Michelle R.; Tobin, Andrew J.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Espinoza, Mario; Heupel, Michelle R.; Tobin, Andrew J.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Espinoza, Mario] James Cook Univ, AIMS JCU, Australian Inst Marine Sci, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Cappo, Mike; Heupel, Michelle R.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia",36,10.1371/journal.pone.0106885,2014

Previous studies of the effect of OA on coral reef calcifiers have described a wide variety of outcomes for studies using comparable partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) ranges, suggesting that key questions remain unresolved. One unresolved hypothesis posits that heterogeneity in the response of reef calcifiers to high pCO(2) is a result of regional-scale variation in the responses to OA. To test this hypothesis, we incubated two coral taxa (Pocillopora damicornis and massive Porites) and two calcified algae (Porolithon onkodes and Halimeda macroloba) under 400, 700 and 1000 mu atm pCO(2) levels in experiments in Moorea (French Polynesia), Hawaii (USA) and Okinawa (Japan), where environmental conditions differ. Both corals and H. macroloba were insensitive to OA at all three locations, while the effects of OA on P. onkodes were location-specific. In Moorea and Hawaii, calcification of P. onkodes was depressed by high pCO(2), but for specimens in Okinawa, there was no effect of OA. Using a study of large geographical scale, we show that resistance to OA of some reef species is a constitutive character expressed across the Pacific.","[Comeau, S.; Carpenter, R. C.; Edmunds, P.

Symbiodinium photosynthesis fuels the growth of an array of marine invertebrates, including cnidarians such as scleractinian corals and octocorals (e.g., gorgonian and soft corals). Studies examining the symbioses between Caribbean gorgonian corals and Symbiodinium are sparse, even though gorgonian corals blanket the landscape of Caribbean coral reefs. The objective of this study was to compare photosynthetic characteristics of Symbiodinium in four common Caribbean gorgonian species: Pterogorgia anceps, Eunicea tourneforti, Pseudoplexaura porosa, and Pseudoplexaura wagenaari. Symbiodinium associated with these four species exhibited differences in Symbiodinium density, chlorophyll a per cell, light absorption by chlorophyll a, and rates of photosynthetic oxygen production. The two Pseudoplexaura species had higher Symbiodinium densities and chlorophyll a per Symbiodinium cell but lower chlorophyll a specific absorption compared to P. anceps and E. tourneforti. Consequently, P. porosa and P. wagenaari had the highest average photosynthetic rates per cm 2 but the lowest average photosynthetic rates per Symbiodinium cell or chlorophyll a. With the exception of Symbiodinium from E. tourneforti, isolated Symbiodinium did not photosynthesize at the same rate as Symbiodinium in hospite. Differences in Symbiodinium photosynthetic performance could not be attributed to Symbiodinium type. All P. anceps (n = 9) and P. wagenaari (n = 6) colonies, in addition to one E. tourneforti and three P. porosa colonies, associated with Symbiodinium type B1. The B1 Symbiodinium from these four gorgonian species did not cluster with lineages of B1 Symbiodinium from scleractinian corals. The remaining eight E. tourneforti colonies harbored Symbiodinium type B1L, while six P. porosa colonies harbored type B1i. Understanding the symbioses between gorgonian corals and Symbiodinium will aid in deciphering why gorgonian corals dominate many Caribbean reefs.","[Ramsby, Blake D.; Shirur, Kartick P.; Goulet, Tamar L.] Univ Mississippi, Dept Biol, University, MS 38677 USA; [Iglesias-Prieto, Roberto] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Unidad Acad Sistemas Arrecifales Puerto Morelos, Cancun, Mexico",5,10.1371/journal.pone.0106419,2014

To better understand Spangled Emperor movements and the adequacy of sanctuary zones within the Ningaloo Reef Marine Park for this species, 84 Spangled Emperor of a broad spectrum of maturity and sex were tagged using internal acoustic tags in a range of lagoon and reef slope habitats both inside and adjacent to the Mangrove Bay Sanctuary zone. Kernel Utilisation Distribution (KUD) was calculated for 39 resident individuals that were detected for more than 30 days. There was no relationship with fish size and movement or site fidelity. Average home range (95% KUD) for residents was 8.5 +/- 0.5 km(2) compared to average sanctuary zone size of 30 km(2). Calculated home range was stable over time resulting in resident animals tagged inside the sanctuary zone spending similar to 80% of time within the sanctuary boundaries. The number of fish remaining within the array of receivers declined steadily over time and after one year more than 60% of tagged fish had moved outside the sanctuary zone and also beyond the 28 km(2) array of receivers. Long term monitoring identified the importance of shifting home range and was essential for understanding overall residency within protected areas and also for identifying spawning related movements.

We investigated the importance of lagoons to the manta ray, Manta alfredi, a wide-ranging and vulnerable species in a less-disturbed atoll ecosystem. Lagoons are highly sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance and are known to be ecologically important to a wide variety of mobile species. We used a novel combination of research tools to examine the reliance of M. alfredi on lagoon habitats. Stable isotope analysis was used to assay the recent energetic importance of lagoons to M. alfredi; high-resolution tracking data provided information about how M. alfredi utilised lagoonal habitats over long and short time periods; acoustic cameras logged patterns of animal entrances and departures from lagoons; and photo identification/laser photogrammetry provided some insight into why they may be using this habitat. M. alfredi showed strong evidence of energetic dependence on lagoon resources during the course of the study and spent long periods of residence within lagoons or frequently transited into them from elsewhere. While within lagoons, they demonstrated affinities for particular structural features within this habitat and showed evidence of temporal patterning in habitat utilization. This work sheds light on how and why M. alfredi uses lagoons and raises questions about how this use may be altered in disturbed settings.

In this framework, we investigated the connectivity and genetic diversity variation among nine wild populations of the black-lipped pearl oyster, Pinctada margaritifera, throughout French Polynesia using ten microsatellite DNA markers. Despite the naturally fragmented habitat (South Pacific oceanic islands), we found high values of genetic diversity and population admixture, indicating connectivity at small and large spatial scales within sampled sites of the Tuamotu, and between the Society and Tuamotu Archipelagos. In the meantime, habitat geomorphology increased genetic drift in populations occurring in small, closed lagoons. Significant genetic structure not correlated to geographic distance was detected mainly between closed and open lagoons. The Marquesas Islands hosted the most divergent populations, likely a result of vicariance. Our results also highlight that migration patterns among lagoons are not symmetrical. Altogether, the general pattern of gene flow, nonsymmetrical migration rates among populations, absence of isolation by distance and absence of recent extinction events found in our study strongly suggest that P. margaritifera populations of French Polynesia follow an asymmetrical island model of dispersal.","[Lemer, Sarah; Planes, Serge] USR 3278 CNRS CRIOBE EPHE, Perpignan, France; [Lemer, Sarah; Planes, Serge] USR 3278 CNRS CRIOBE EPHE, Papetoai, Moorea, Fr Polynesia; [Lemer, Sarah; Planes, Serge] Lab Excellence CORAIL, Perpignan, France",9,10.1007/s00227-014-2484-9,2014

Since the efficacy of management approaches vary depending on the sedentary or mobile nature of the target species, presence, space use and depth utilisation were examined to understand the movement patterns of redthroat emperor Lethrinus miniatus. Sixty individuals were monitored for up to 12 months in an acoustic array comprising three coral reefs, and variation in space use and movement patterns was observed among 26 individuals. Half of the individuals were recorded only in proximity of one receiver along the reef edge, while the other half were detected at multiple receivers and used horizontal areas of approximately 4 km(2). Periods of non-detection and lower detection frequency at night (chi (1) (2) = 342.157, P < 0.001) indicated individuals may move away from the monitored reef edge to the adjacent sandy habitat, but most movements outside the array remain unknown. Long-distance movement was recorded for one individual, recaptured similar to 160 km from the release location. Generally, no trends in depth use were apparent, L. miniatus inhabited a variety of depths, which were not related to individual size or time of day, yet some effect of month was evident. Variation in movement among adult L. miniatus indicates that while some individuals undergo broader-scale movement, spatial closures that cover individual reefs (> 4 km(2)) could provide protection from fishing for the proportion of the population that displayed high site fidelity and moderate-sized activity spaces (over a period of up to 12 months).","[Currey, Leanne M.] James Cook Univ, AIMS JCU, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Currey, Leanne M.; Heupel, Michelle R.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Currey, Leanne M.; Heupel, Michelle R.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.; Williams, Ashley J.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Williams, Ashley J.] Secretariat Pacific Commun, Ocean Fisheries Programme, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia",16,10.1007/s00227-014-2497-4,2014

Although the EAM appears to be a relatively simple and consistent habitat, significant differences in cryptofaunal assemblages were found between locations. EAM assemblages from Orpheus Island were markedly different. This appears to be a function of the sediment profile characteristics (grain size > 60 A mu m) at Orpheus Island, as many cryptofaunal taxa displayed positive relationships with sediment volume. However, sediment volumes did not differ significantly between the three locations, highlighting the possibility of cyclonic activity affecting the sediment profile at Orpheus Island in the months preceding the study, in addition to the nutrient input from major terrigenous sources. The results of this study show that EAM cryptofaunal assemblages are not uniform across the Great Barrier Reef and suggest that dissolved nutrients, sediment loads and distance from river systems may be significant drivers of cryptobenthic faunal compositions.","[Kramer, M.

Underwater observations and experiments were conducted on a shallow fringing coral reef in Malaysia to examine whether predation risks affect diel activity, habitat use, and survival of the rhynchocinetid shrimp Cinetorhynchus hendersoni. The study site was within a protected area where predatory fish were abundant. Visual surveys and tethering experiments were conducted in April-May 2010 to compare the abundance of shrimps and predatory fishes and the relative predation intensity on shrimps during day and night. Shrimps were not seen during the day but came out of refuges at night, when the risk of being eaten was reduced. Shrimp preferences for substrata of different complexities and types were examined at night when they could be seen on the reef; complex substrata were preferred, while simple substrata were avoided. Shrimps were abundant on high-complexity columnar-foliate Porites rus, but tended to make little use of branching Acropora spp. Subsequent tethering experiments, conducted during daytime in June 2013, compared the relative mortality of shrimps on simple (sand-rubble, massive Porites spp.) and complex (P. rus, branching Acropora spp.) substrata under different predation risk scenarios (i.e., different tether lengths and exposure durations). The mortality of shrimps with short tethers (high risk) was high on all substrata while, under low and intermediate predation risks (long tethers), shrimp mortality was reduced on complex corals relative to that on sand-rubble or massive Porites spp. Overall, mortality was lowest on P. rus. Our study indicates that predation risks constrain shrimp activity and habitat choice, forcing them to hide deep inside complex substrata during the day. Such behavioural responses to predation risks and their consequences for the trophic role of invertebrate mesoconsumers warrant further investigation, especially in areas where predatory fishes have been overexploited.","[Ory, Nicolas C.; Duprey, Nicolas] Univ Hong Kong, Swire Inst Marine Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ory, Nicolas C.; Dudgeon, David; Duprey, Nicolas] Univ Hong Kong, Sch Biol Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Thiel, Martin] Univ Catolica Norte, Fac Ciencias Mar, Coquimbo, Chile; [Thiel, Martin] CEAZA, Coquimbo, Chile",5,10.1007/s00338-014-1163-0,2014

The leeward/west coast of the island of Hawai'i consists of the largest expanse of intact reefs in the Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI), yet little is known about the health of its coral communities. We measured prevalence of coral diseases and non-disease conditions at nine regions across two depths in the summer and winter months between 2010 and 2011. We also assessed long-term changes in coral cover (2003-2011). Mean prevalence of chronic diseases was 5-21 times greater than previously reported for the MHI. Coral health varied minimally across survey months with mild seasonality only detected in algal overgrowth (ALOG). Coral health varied considerably by depth and site, and was primarily driven by the most prevalent and common conditions: Porites growth anomalies (13.7 +/- A 0.82 %), Porites trematodiasis (9.5 +/- A 0.90 %), discoloration (5.6 +/- A 0.33 %), ALOG (9.9 +/- A 0.54 %), and gastropod predation (2.4 +/- A 0.23). While several conditions were significantly elevated in shallow zones, unique site x depth interactions suggest that specific site-level factors are driving prevalence. At the coast-wide level, percentage of coral cover did not change significantly between 2003 and 2011, but decreased significantly at two sites and increased at one site. Based on coral cover decline and high prevalence of certain coral health conditions, we identified four regions of concern (PuakAi, Mauna Lani, Ka'A << pA << lehu, and HAinaunau). The high spatial variation in coral health not only advances our understanding of coral disease ecology, but also supports reef resilience planning by identifying vulnerable areas that would benefit most from targeted conservation and management efforts.","[Couch, C.

The months of August through December are dominated by increased coral Ba/Ca values, corresponding to the rainy season. With river water enriched in barium related to nearshore seawater, coral Ba/Ca ratios are presented as a proxy for input of fine-grained terrigenous sediment to the nearshore environment. The century-long Ba/Ca coral record indicates that the Asan fore reef is within the zone of impact from discharged sediments transported from the Piti-Asan watershed and has experienced increased terrestrial sedimentation since the 1940s. This abrupt shift in sedimentation occurred at the same time as both the sudden denudation of the landscape by military ordinance and the immediate subsequent development of the Asan area through the end of the war, from 1944 through 1945. In response to rapid input of sediment, as determined from coral Ba/Ca values, coral growth rates were reduced for almost two decades, while calcification rates recovered much more quickly. Furthermore, coral luminescence is decoupled from the Ba/Ca record, which is consistent with degradation of soil organic matter through disturbance by forest fires, suggesting a potential index of fire history and degradation of soil organic matter. These patterns were not seen in the cores from nearby reefs associated with watersheds that have not undergone the same degree of landscape denudation. Taken together, these records provide a valuable tool for understanding the compounding effects of land-use change on coral reef health.","[Prouty, Nancy G.; Storlazzi, Curt D.] US Geol Survey, Pacific Sci Ctr, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [McCutcheon, Amanda L.; Jenson, John W.] Univ Guam, Water & Environm Res Inst Western Pacific, UOG Stn, Mangilao, GU 96923 USA; [McCutcheon, Amanda L.] US Natl Pk Serv War Pacific Natl Hist Pk, Hagatna, GU 96910 USA",7,10.1007/s00338-014-1166-x,2014

The effects of length and age on batch fecundity did not differ significantly between reserve and fished reefs in any region, but weight-specific fecundity was 100 % greater for large 2.0 kg females on reserve reefs compared with fished reefs in the central GBR.

The interaction between these stressors has been the subject of recent studies on reef organisms such as corals, bryozoa, molluscs, and crustose coralline algae. Here we investigated the combined effects of elevated sea surface temperatures and pCO(2) on two species of photosymbiont-bearing coral reef Foraminifera: Heterostegina depressa (hosting diatoms) and Marginopora vertebralis (hosting dinoflagellates). The effects of single and combined stressors were studied by monitoring survivorship, growth, and physiological parameters, such as respiration, photochemistry (pulse amplitude modulation fluorometry and oxygen production), and chl a content. Specimens were exposed in flow-through aquaria for up to seven weeks to combinations of two pCO(2) (similar to 790 and similar to 490 A mu atm) and two temperature (28 and 31 A degrees C) regimes. Elevated temperature had negative effects on the physiology of both species. Elevated pCO(2) had negative effects on growth and apparent photosynthetic rate in H.depressa but a positive effect on effective quantum yield. With increasing pCO(2), chl a content decreased in H. depressa and increased in M. vertebralis. The strongest stress responses were observed when the two stressors acted in combination. An interaction term was statistically significant in half of the measured parameters. Further exploration revealed that 75 % of these cases showed a synergistic (= larger than additive) interaction between the two stressors. These results indicate that negative physiological effects on photosymbiont-bearing coral reef Foraminifera are likely to be stronger under simultaneous acidification and temperature rise than what would be expected from the effect of each of the stressors individually.","[Schmidt, Christiane; Kucera, Michal] Univ Bremen, MARUM, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Uthicke, Sven] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia",22,10.1007/s00338-014-1151-4,2014

Mounting experimental evidence suggests that OA negatively impacts fundamental life functions of scleractinian corals, including growth and sexual reproduction. Although regeneration is regarded as a chief life function in scleractinian corals and essential to maintain the colony's integrity, the effect of OA on regeneration processes has not yet been investigated. To evaluate the effects of OA on regeneration, the common Indo-Pacific corals Porites sp., Favia favus, Acropora eurystoma, and Stylophora pistillata were inflicted with lesions (314-350 mm(2), depending on species) and incubated in different pCO(2): (1) ambient seawater (400 A mu atm, pH 8.1), (2) intermediate (1,800 A mu atm, pH 7.6), and (3) high (4,000 A mu atm, pH 7.3) for extended periods of time (60-120 d). While all coral species after 60 d had significantly higher tissue regeneration in ambient conditions as compared to the intermediate and high treatments, reduction in regeneration rate was more pronounced in the slow-growing massive Porites sp. and F. favus than the relatively fast-growing, branching S. pistillata and A. eurystoma. This coincided with reduced tissue biomass of Porites sp., F. favus, and A. eurystoma in higher pCO(2), but not in S. pistillata. Porites sp., F. favus, and S. pistillata also experienced a decrease in Symbiodinium density in higher pCO(2), while in A. eurystoma there was no change. We hypothesize that a lowered regenerative capacity under elevated pCO(2) may be related to resource trade-offs, energy cost of acid/base regulation, and/or decrease in total energy budget. This is the first study to demonstrate that elevated pCO(2) could have a compounding influence on coral regeneration following injury, potentially affecting the capacity of reef corals to recover following physical disturbance.","[Horwitz, Rael; Fine, Maoz] Bar Ilan Univ, Mina & Everard Goodman Fac Life Sci, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Horwitz, Rael; Fine, Maoz] Interuniv Inst Marine Sci, IL-88000 Elat, Israel",10,10.1007/s00338-014-1150-5,2014

This study aimed to simulate future water flow patterns and water surface heating in response to increased air temperature within a coral reef system in Bocas del Toro, Panama, located within the Caribbean Sea. Water flow and SST were modeled using the Delft3D-FLOWA (c) computer simulation package. Locally measured physical parameters, including bathymetry, astronomic tidal forcing, and coral habitat distribution were input into the model and water flow, and SST was simulated over a four-month period under present day, as well as projected warming scenarios in 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s. Changes in SST, and hence the thermal stress to corals, were quantified by degree heating weeks. Results showed that present-day reported bleaching sites were consistent with localized regions of continuous high SST. Regions with highest SST were located within shallow coastal sites adjacent to the mainland or within the interior of the bay, and characterized by low currents with high water retention times. Under projected increases in SSTs, shallow reef areas in low flow regions were found to be hot spots for future bleaching.","[Li, Angang; Reidenbach, Matthew A.] Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA",7,10.1007/s00338-014-1162-1,2014

Klein et al. integrate land-sea planning by optimising the design of Fiji's expanded protected area network to benefit coral reefs, while maintaining a terrestrial network that is representative of Fiji's various terrestrial ecosystems. They discuss the benefits of various spatial conservation models compared to a candidate protected area network proposed by Fiji's Protected Area Committee (FPAC), which is based on expert knowledge and a scoring system. This paper argues that their analyses are best interpreted as the FPAC network outperforming the models proposed by Klein et al. in protecting terrestrial biodiversity. The FPAC network performs better because it includes data that was not available for spatial modelling, especially the percentage of endemic species per ecosystem and the practicalities of protecting an area earmarked for conservation. This suggests that expert knowledge can be an important resource for conservation planning, especially in developing countries, and that spatial conservation planning should harness this knowledge.

To examine potential impacts on native reef fish communities, lionfish density and size distributions were estimated from fall 2010 to fall 2013 with a remotely operated vehicle at natural (n = 16) and artificial (n = 22) reef sites. Lionfish (n = 934) also were sampled via spearfishing to examine effects of habitat type, season, and fish size on their diet and trophic ecology. There was an exponential increase in lionfish density at both natural and artificial reefs over the study period. By fall 2013, mean lionfish density at artificial reefs (14.7 fish 100 m(-2)) was two orders of magnitude higher than at natural reefs (0.49 fish 100 m(-2)), and already was among the highest reported in the western Atlantic. Lionfish diet was significantly different among habitats, seasons, and size classes, with smaller (<250 mm total length) fish consuming more benthic invertebrates and the diet of lionfish sampled from artificial reefs being composed predominantly of non-reef associated prey. The ontogenetic shift in lionfish feeding ecology was consistent with delta N-15 values of white muscle tissue that were positively related to total length. Overall, diet results indicate lionfish are generalist mesopredators in the nGOM that become more piscivorous at larger size. However, lionfish diet was much more varied at artificial reef sites where they clearly were foraging on open substrates away from reef structure. These results have important implications for tracking the lionfish invasion in the nGOM, as well as estimating potential direct and indirect impacts on native reef fish communities in this region.","[Dahl, Kristen A.; Patterson, William F., III] Univ S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, Mobile, AL 36688 USA",33,10.1371/journal.pone.0105852,2014

This study examined coral reefs in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands across a 12-year period that included elevated Crown-of-Thorns Starfish densities (COTS) and tropical storms that were drivers of spatially-inconsistent disturbance and recovery patterns. At the island scale, disturbance impacts were highest on Saipan with reduced fish sizes, grazing urchins, and water quality, despite having a more favorable geological foundation for coral growth compared with Rota. However, individual drivers of reef dynamics were better quantified through site-level investigations that built upon island generalizations. While COTS densities were the strongest predictors of coral decline as expected, interactive terms that included wave exposure and size of the overall fish assemblages improved models (R-2 and AIC values). Both wave exposure and fish size diminished disturbance impacts and had negative associations with COTS. However, contrasting findings emerged when examining net ecological change across the 12-year period. Wave exposure had a ubiquitous, positive influence upon the net change in favorable benthic substrates (i.e. corals and other heavily calcifying substrates, R-2 = 0.17 for all reeftypes grouped), yet including interactive terms for herbivore size and grazing urchin densities, as well as stratifying by major reeftypes, substantially improved models (R-2 = 0.21 to 0.89, lower AIC scores). Net changes in coral assemblages (i.e., coral ordination scores) were more sensitive to herbivore size or the water quality proxy acting independently (R-2 = 0.28 to 0.44). We conclude that COTS densities were the strongest drivers of coral decline, however, net ecological change was most influenced by localized stressors, especially herbivore sizes and grazing urchin densities. Interestingly, fish size, rather than biomass, was consistently a better predictor, supporting allometric, size-and-function relationships of fish assemblages.

However, few empirical tests of this hypothesis exist. A central prediction, that the tempo of morphological evolution and ecological diversification should increase following decoupling events, remains inadequately tested. In damselfishes (Pomacentridae), a ceratomandibular ligament links the hyoid bar and lower jaws, coupling two main morphofunctional units directly involved in both feeding and sound production. Here, we test the decoupling hypothesis by examining the evolutionary consequences of the loss of the ceratomandibular ligament in multiple damselfish lineages. As predicted, we find that rates of morphological evolution of trophic structures increased following the loss of the ligament. However, this increase in evolutionary rate is not associated with an increase in trophic breadth, but rather with morphofunctional specialization for the capture of zooplanktonic prey. Lineages lacking the ceratomandibular ligament also shows different acoustic signals (i.e. higher variation of pulse periods) from others, resulting in an increase of the acoustic diversity across the family. Our results support the idea that trait decoupling can increase morphological and behavioural diversity through increased specialization rather than the generation of novel ecotypes.","[Frederich, Bruno; Olivier, Damien; Parmentier, Eric] Univ Liege, Lab Morphol Fonct & Evolut, Appl & Fundamental Fish Res Ctr, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Litsios, Glenn] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Litsios, Glenn] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Alfaro, Michael E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",17,10.1098/rspb.2014.1047,2014

Otolith elemental compositions allowed high discrimination of mangroves and reefs with 83.8% and 98.7% correct classification, respectively. Reefs were characterized by higher concentrations of Rb and Sr and mangroves by higher concentrations of Ba, Cr, Mn and Sn. All adult L. fulviflamma collected on reefs presented a mangrove signature during their juvenile stage with 85% inhabiting mangrove for their entire juvenile life (about 1 year). The analysis of 2942 UVC revealed that the species was absent from isolated islands of the New Caledonian archipelago where mangroves were absent. Furthermore, strong positive correlations existed between the abundance of L. fulviflamma and the area of mangrove (r = 0.84 for occurrence, 0.93 for density and 0.89 for biomass).

Marine reserves offer the opportunity to determine ecosystem-level effects of manipulated predator densities, while parallel monitoring of adjacent fished areas allows separating these effects from regional-scale change. Relationships between two measures of benthic habitat structure (reef architecture and topographic complexity) and key invertebrate species were followed over 17 years at fished and protected subtidal rocky reefs associated with two southern Australian marine reserves. Two commercially harvested species, the southern rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) and blacklip abalone (Haliotis rubra) were initially weakly associated with habitat structure across all fished and protected sites. The strength of association with habitat for both species increased markedly at protected sites 2 years after marine reserve declaration, and then gradually weakened over subsequent years. The increasing size of rock lobster within reserves apparently reduced their dependency on reef shelters as refuges from predation. Rising predation by fish and rock lobster in the reserves corresponded with weakening invertebrate-habitat relationships for H. rubra and sea urchins (Heliocidaris erythrogramma). These results emphasise that animal-habitat relationships are not necessarily stable through time and highlight the value of marine reserves as reference sites. Our work shows that fishery closures to enhance populations of commercially important and keystone species should be in areas with a range of habitat features to accommodate shifting ecological requirements with ontogenesis.","[Alexander, Timothy J.; Johnson, Craig R.; Barrett, Neville S.; Edgar, Graham J.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Alexander, Timothy J.] Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Div Aquat Ecol & Evolut, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Alexander, Timothy J.] EAWAG Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Fish Ecol & Evolut, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Biogeochem, CH-6047 Kastanienbaum, Switzerland; [Haddon, Malcolm] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Castray Esplanade, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia",2,10.1007/s00227-014-2462-2,2014

While the biological and physiological impacts of increased pCO(2) are well documented for many hermatypic corals, the potential effects on bioerosion processes remain largely unknown. Increases in pCO(2) are likely to modify the direct interactions between corals and bioeroders, such as excavating sponges, with broad implications for the balance between biologically mediated deposition and erosion of carbonate in reef communities. This study investigated the effects of three levels of CO2 (present-day, mid-century and end-of-century projections) on the direct interaction between a bioeroding sponge, Cliona varians, and a Caribbean coral, Porites furcata. Increased pCO(2) concentrations had no effect on the attachment rates of C. varians to the corals, and we observed no significant impact of pCO(2) on the survival of either the coral or sponges. However, exposure to end-of-century levels of CO2-dosing (similar to 750 mu atm) reduced calcification in P. furcata and led to a significant increase in sponge-mediated erosion of P. furcata. These findings demonstrate that pCO(2) can enhance erosional efficiency without impacting survival or competitive vigor in these two species. While few studies have considered the influence of pCO(2) on the competitive outcomes of interactions between corals and other reef organisms, our study suggests that assessing the impacts of changing pCO(2) on species interactions is crucial to adequately predict ecosystem-level responses in the future.","[Stubler, Amber D.; Furman, Bradley T.; Peterson, Bradley J.] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11946 USA",22,10.1007/s00227-014-2466-y,2014

Self-recruitment to this MPA ranged from 50-84%; within the entire 60 km study region, self-recruitment accounted for 45% of all individuals settling to study reefs. On biweekly time scales we observed directional variability in alongshore current data and larval dispersal trajectories; if viewed in isolation these data suggest the system behaves as a source-sink metapopulation. However aggregate biweekly data over two years reveal a reef network in which H. rubicundus behaves more like a well-mixed metapopulation. As one of the few empirical studies of population connectivity within a temperate open coast reef network, this work can inform the MPA design process, implementation of ecosystem based management plans, and facilitate conservation decisions.","[Cook, Geoffrey S.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Cook, Geoffrey S.] NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Parnell, P.

The marine fairy wrasse Cirrhilabrus solorensis displays prominent fluorescence in the deep red range (650-700 nm). This is remarkable because marine fishes are generally assumed to have poor sensitivity in this part of the visual spectrum. Here, we investigated whether C. solorensis males can perceive the fluorescence featured in this species by testing whether the presence or absence of red fluorescence affects male-male interactions under exclusive blue illumination. Given that males respond aggressively towards mirror-image stimuli, we quantified agonistic behaviour against mirrors covered with filters that did or did not absorb long (i.e. red) wavelengths. Males showed significantly fewer agonistic responses when their fluorescent signal was masked, independent of brightness differences. Our results unequivocally show that C. solorensis can see its deep red fluorescent coloration and that this pattern affects male-male interactions. This is the first study to demonstrate that deep red fluorescent body coloration can be perceived and has behavioural significance in a reef fish.","[Gerlach, Tobias; Sprenger, Dennis; Michiels, Nico K.] Univ Tubingen, Anim Evolutionary Ecol Grp, Fac Sci, Tubingen, Germany",18,10.1098/rspb.2014.0787,2014

Although geographical factors have been traditionally thought to promote speciation, recent studies have underscored the importance of ecological interactions as one of the main drivers of diversification. Here, we test if differences in species richness of closely related lineages match predictions based on the concept of density-dependent diversification. As radiation progresses, ecological niche-space would become increasingly saturated, resulting in fewer opportunities for speciation. To assess this hypothesis, we tested whether reef fish niche shifts toward usage of low-quality food resources (i.e. relatively low energy/protein per unit mass), such as algae, detritus, sponges and corals are accompanied by rapid net diversification. Using available molecular information, we reconstructed phylogenies of four major reef fish clades (Acanthuroidei, Chaetodontidae, Labridae and Pomacentridae) to estimate the timing of radiations of their subclades. We found that the evolution of species-rich clades was associated with a switch to low quality food in three of the four clades analyzed, which is consistent with a density-dependent model of diversification. We suggest that ecological opportunity may play an important role in understanding the diversification of reef-fish lineages.","[Lobato, Fabio L.; Siqueira, Alexandre C.; Liedke, Ana M.

While many water quality parameters have been proposed to contribute to reef declines, little evidence exists conclusively linking specific water quality parameters with increased disease prevalence in situ. Here we report evidence from in situ coral health surveys confirming that chronic exposure to dredging-associated sediment plumes significantly increase the prevalence of white syndromes, a devastating group of globally important coral diseases. Coral health surveys were conducted along a dredging-associated sediment plume gradient to assess the relationship between sedimentation, turbidity and coral health. Reefs exposed to the highest number of days under the sediment plume (296 to 347 days) had two-fold higher levels of disease, largely driven by a 2.5-fold increase in white syndromes, and a six-fold increase in other signs of compromised coral health relative to reefs with little or no plume exposure (0 to 9 days). Multivariate modeling and ordination incorporating sediment exposure level, coral community composition and cover, predation and multiple thermal stress indices provided further confirmation that sediment plume exposure level was the main driver of elevated disease and other compromised coral health indicators. This study provides the first evidence linking dredging-associated sedimentation and turbidity with elevated coral disease prevalence in situ. Our results may help to explain observed increases in global coral disease prevalence in recent decades and suggest that minimizing sedimentation and turbidity associated with coastal development will provide an important management tool for controlling coral disease epizootics.","[Pollock, F.

On coral reefs, the benthic coverage of coral and algal holobionts varies due to natural and anthropogenic forcings. Different benthic macroorganisms are predicted to have specific microbiomes. In contrast, local environmental factors are predicted to select for specific metabolic pathways in microbes. To reconcile these two predictions, we hypothesized that adaptation of microbiomes to local conditions is facilitated by the horizontal transfer of genes responsible for specific metabolic capabilities. To test this hypothesis, microbial metagenomes were sequenced from 22 coral reefs at 11 Line Islands in the central Pacific that together span a wide range of biogeochemical and anthropogenic influences. Consistent with our hypothesis, the percent cover of major benthic functional groups significantly correlated with particular microbial taxa. Reefs with higher coral cover had a coral microbiome with higher abundances of Alphaproteobacteria (such as Rhodobacterales and Sphingomonadales), whereas microbiomes of algae-dominated reefs had higher abundances of Gammaproteobacteria (such as Alteromonadales, Pseudomonadales, and Vibrionales), Betaproteobacteria, and Bacteriodetes. In contrast to taxa, geography was the strongest predictor of microbial community metabolism. Microbial communities on reefs with higher nutrient availability (e. g., equatorial upwelling zones) were enriched in genes involved in nutrient-related metabolisms (e. g., nitrate and nitrite ammonification, Ton/Tol transport, etc.). On reefs further from the equator, microbes had more genes encoding chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosystems I/II. These results support the hypothesis that core microbiomes are determined by holobiont macroorganisms, and that those core taxa adapt to local conditions by selecting for advantageous metabolic genes.","[Kelly, Linda W.; Barott, Katie L.; Dinsdale, Elizabeth A.; Haynes, Matthew; Lim, Yan Wei; McDole, Tracey; Rohwer, Forest] San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Williams, Gareth J.; Barott, Katie L.; Haas, Andreas F.; Sandin, Stuart A.; Smith, Jennifer E.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Marine Biol Res Div, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Carlson, Craig A.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Marine Sci Inst, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Edwards, Robert A.] San Diego State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Nelson, Craig E.] Univ Hawaii, Dept Oceanog, Ctr Microbial Oceanog Res & Educ, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Sala, Enric] Natl Geog Soc, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Vermeij, Mark J.

In order to contextualise this general degradation, research on community composition is necessary in the context of varied disturbance histories and the biological processes and physical features thought to retard or promote recovery. We conducted a spatial assessment of coral reef communities across five reefs of the central Great Barrier Reef, Australia, with known disturbance histories, and assessed patterns of coral cover and community composition related to a range of other variables thought to be important for reef dynamics. Two of the reefs had not been extensively disturbed for at least 15 years prior to the surveys. Three of the reefs had been severely impacted by crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks and coral bleaching approximately a decade before the surveys, from which only one of them was showing signs of recovery based on independent surveys. We incorporated wave exposure (sheltered and exposed) and reef zone (slope, crest and flat) into our design, providing a comprehensive assessment of the spatial patterns in community composition on these reefs. Categorising corals into life history groupings, we document major coral community differences in the unrecovered reefs, compared to the composition and covers found on the undisturbed reefs. The recovered reef, despite having similar coral cover, had a different community composition from the undisturbed reefs, which may indicate slow successional processes, or a different natural community dominance pattern due to hydrology and other oceanographic factors. The variables that best correlated with patterns in the coral community among sites included the density of juvenile corals, herbivore fish biomass, fish species richness and the cover of macroalgae. Given increasing impacts to the Great Barrier Reef, efforts to mitigate local stressors will be imperative to encouraging coral communities to persist into the future.","[Graham, Nicholas A.

Particularly, early developmental stages are probably more susceptible to ocean acidification due to insufficient regulations of their acid-base balance. Transgenerational acclimation can be an important mechanism to mediate impacts of increased CO2 on marine species, yet very little is known about the potential of parental effects in teleosts. Therefore, transgenerational effects were investigated on life history in juvenile three-spined sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus by acclimating parents (collected in April 2012, 55A degrees 03'N, 8A degrees 44'E) and offspring to ambient (similar to 400 A mu atm) and elevated (similar to 1,000 A mu atm) CO2 levels and measured parental fecundity as well as offspring survival, growth and otolith characteristics. Exposure to elevated CO2 concentrations led to an increase in clutch size in adults as well as increased juvenile survival and growth rates between 60 and 90 days post-hatch and enlarged otolith areas compared with fish from ambient CO2 concentrations. Moreover, transgenerational effects were observed in reduced survival and body size 30 days post-hatch as well as in enlarged otoliths at the end of the experiment, when fathers or both parents were acclimated to the high-CO2 environment. These results may suggest that elevated CO2 concentrations had rather positive effects on life-history traits of three-spined sticklebacks, but that parental acclimation can modify these effects without improving offspring fitness. Although the mechanistic basis of such transgenerational acclimation remains unclear, selective gradients within generations seem to determine the direction of transgenerational effects.","[Schade, Franziska M.; Wegner, K.

In the experiment 1, HPLC analyses highlighted that the live coral reef (and not the dead coral reef) produced different and distinct molecules, and some of these molecules could be transported to a distance of at least 2 km from the reef with a reduction of concentration by 14-17-fold. In the experiment 2, C. viridis, Palaemonidae sp, and S. latimanus larvae were significantly attracted by chemical cues from a live coral reef (sampling station: 0 km), but not from a dead coral reef. However, only C. viridis larvae detected the chemical cues until 1 km away from the live coral reef. Overall, our study showed that chemical cues emitted by a live coral reef were transported farthest away in the ocean (at least 2 km) compared to those from a dead coral reef and that fish larvae could detect these cues until 1 km. These results support the assumption of a larval settlement ineffective in degraded coral reefs, which will assist conservationists and reef managers concerned with maintaining biodiversity on reefs that are becoming increasingly degraded.","[Lecchini, David] CRIOBE, USR CNRS EPHE 3278, Papetoai 98729, Moorea, Fr Polynesia; [Lecchini, David; Lecellier, Gael] Lab Excellence CORAIL, Moorea 98729, Fr Polynesia; [Miura, Takahiro; Nakamura, Yohei] Kochi Univ, Grad Sch Integrated Arts & Sci, Nankoku, Kochi 7838502, Japan; [Lecellier, Gael] Univ Versailles St, F-78035 Versailles, France; [Banaigs, Bernard] Univ Perpignan, Lab Chim Biomol & Environm EA 4215, F-66025 Perpignan, France",12,10.1007/s00227-014-2451-5,2014

As well as providing conservation benefits, marine reserves provide benefits to recreational scuba divers who dive within the reserve, as well as to recreational and commercial fishers outside the reserve through spill-over effects. To ensure benefits are being realised, management of marine reserves requires ongoing monitoring and surveillance. These are not costless, and many marine reserve managers impose an entry fee. In some countries, dive tourism is major income source to coastal industries, and a concern is that high entry fees may dissuade divers. In this paper, the price elasticity of demand for dive tourism in three countries in South East Asia - Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia - is estimated using a travel-cost model. From the model, the total non-market use value associated with diving in the area is estimated to be in the order of US$4.5 billion a year. The price elasticity of demand in the region is highly inelastic, such that increasing the cost of diving through a management levy would have little impact on total diver numbers.

In the marine environment, understanding connectivity is still a major challenge, due to the technical difficulties of tracking larvae. Recently, parentage analysis has provided a means to address this question effectively. To be effective, this method requires limited adult movement and extensive sampling of parents, which is often not possible for marine species. An alternative approach that is less sensitive to constraints in parental movement and sampling could be the reconstruction of sibships. Here, we directly measure connectivity and larval dispersal in a temperate marine ecosystem through both analytical approaches. We use data from 178 single nucleotide polymorphism markers to perform parentage and sibship reconstruction of the black-faced blenny (Tripterygion delaisi) from an open coastline in the Mediterranean Sea. Parentage analysis revealed a decrease in dispersal success in the focal area over 1 km distance and approximately 6.5% of the juveniles were identified as self-recruits. Sibship reconstruction analysis found that, in general, full siblings did not recruit together to the same location, and that the largest distance between recruitment locations was much higher (11.5 km) than found for parent-offspring pairs (1.2 km). Direct measurements of dispersal are essential to understanding connectivity patterns in different marine habitats, and show the degree of self-replenishment and sustainability of populations of marine organisms. We demonstrate that sibship reconstruction allows direct measurements of dispersal and family structure in marine species while being more easily applied in those species for which the collection of the parental population is difficult or unfeasible.","[Schunter, C.; Raventos, N.; Macpherson, E.] CSIC, CEAB, Blanes 17300, Girona, Spain; [Schunter, C.; Pascual, M.] Univ Barcelona, Dept Genet, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Schunter, C.; Pascual, M.] Univ Barcelona, IRBio, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Garza, J.

Here, we examine the distribution of benthic groupers (family Serranidae) in coral reef communities from the Lakshadweep archipelago (Arabian Sea) in response to structural complexity and long-term habitat stability. These coral reefs that have been subject to two major El Nio Southern Oscillation-related coral bleaching events in the last decades (1998 and 2010). First, we employ a long-term (12-yr) benthic-monitoring dataset to track habitat structural stability at twelve reef sites in the archipelago. Structural stability of reefs was strongly driven by exposure to monsoon storms and depth, which made deeper and more sheltered reefs on the eastern aspect more stable than the more exposed (western) and shallower reefs. We surveyed groupers (species richness, abundance, biomass) in 60 sites across the entire archipelago, representing both exposures and depths. Sites were selected along a gradient of structural complexity from very low to high. Grouper biomass appeared to vary with habitat stability with significant differences between depth and exposure; sheltered deep reefs had a higher grouper biomass than either sheltered shallow or exposed (deep and shallow) reefs. Species richness and abundance showed similar (though not significant) trends. More interestingly, average grouper biomass increased exponentially with structural complexity, but only at the sheltered deep (high stability) sites, despite the availability of recovered structure at exposed deep and shallow sites (lower-stability sites). This trend was especially pronounced for long-lived groupers (life span > 10 yrs). These results suggest that long-lived groupers may prefer temporally stable reefs, independent of the local availability of habitat structure. In reefs subject to repeated disturbances, the presence of structurally stable reefs may be critical as refuges for functionally important, long-lived species like groupers.","[Karkarey, R.; Kelkar, N.; Lobo, A.

One hundred and three species were identified at MCEs (40-70 m), with high abundances and species richness, though both varied greatly among transects. Most species at MCEs were common inhabitants of shallow reefs, but some were restricted to mesophotic depths. An additional 15 species were added to those previously classified as indicator species of mesophotic areas in Puerto Rico. The MCE fish assemblage was distinct from shallow areas (30 m), with taxonomic composition, abundance and the proportion of trophic guilds varying with increasing depth. The dominant trophic guild within MCEs was the zooplanktivores, while herbivores dominated shallow reefs. Both herbivores and zooplanktivores responded strongly, and oppositely, to depth. The few herbivores associated with deep MCEs are small-bodied species. The largest changes within the mesophotic fish community along the depth gradient occurred at 60 m, similar to that reported for algae and corals, and seem to represent both a response to reduced light and variations in herbivory. The presence of commercially important fishes at MCEs, many considered to be threatened by fishing pressure in shallow areas, suggests that MCEs are important for the conservation of these species. This study represents the first quantitative in situ observations and descriptions of fishes inhabiting MCEs at depths of 50-70 m in Puerto Rico and highlights the role of MCEs as valuable habitats for reef fishes. The composition and distribution of the MCEs fish community should be incorporated when planning for the spatial management of coral reef resources.","[Bejarano, I.; Appeldoorn, R.

Marked differences were apparent according to status, but this was not consistent among the three species; TP Cheilinus fasciatus tended to swim in longer bouts with less frequent searching or feeding than initial phase (IP) conspecifics; TP Cirrhilabrus punctatus exhibited less frequent feeding and travelling than IP conspecifics, while the most aggressive species Stethojulis bandanensis displayed no significant intraspecific differences.

While changes in prey availability and interspecific competition have been linked to patterns of prey selection, body condition, and survival in coral reef fishes, rarely has the influence of abiotic environmental conditions on foraging been considered. We used underwater digital video to explore how prey availability and wave exposure influence the behavioural time budgets and prey selectivity of four species of obligate coral-feeding butterflyfishes. All four species displayed high selectivity towards live hard corals, both in terms of time invested and frequency of searching and feeding events. However, our novel analysis revealed that such selectivity was sensitive to wave exposure in some species, despite there being no significant differences in the availability of each prey category across exposures. In most cases, these obligate corallivores increased their selectivity towards their most favoured prey types at sites of high wave exposure. This suggests there are costs to foraging under different wave environments that can shape the foraging patterns of butterflyfishes in concert with other conditions such as prey availability, interspecific competition, and territoriality. Given that energy acquisition is crucial to the survival and fitness of fishes, we highlight how such environmental forcing of foraging behaviour may influence the ecological response of species to the ubiquitous and highly variable wave climates of shallow coral reefs.","[Noble, Mae M.; Cvitanovic, Christopher; Fulton, Christopher J.] Australian Natl Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Res Sch Biol, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Pratchett, Morgan S.; Coker, Darren J.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",10,10.1007/s00338-014-1140-7,2014

In this study, PIT tags were inserted into detrital coral fragments and used to establish source-sink transport pathways on a fringing reef on Majuro Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Results suggest the transport of gravel-sized material on the inter-tidal reef flat is exclusively across-reef towards the lagoon. Considerable variation in the distance travelled by fragments was observed. Fragments were largely intact and visually recognisable after almost 5 months on the reef flat. However, the branches of some recovered fragments had broken off and corallite abrasion was observed in recovered fragments.

Despite this, very little is currently known about the reproductive biology of Great Barrier Reef (GBR) sponge species. Here, we established reproductive parameters including mode of sexuality and development, seasonality, sex ratios, gametogenesis, reproductive output, and size at sexual maturity for the common phototrophic intertidal sponge, Carteriospongia foliascens, in the central GBR over two reproductive cycles. A population sexual productivity index (PoSPi) integrating key reproductive parameters was formulated to compare population larval supply over time. This study shows that C. foliascens is reproductive all year round, gonochoric and viviparous, with larvae developing asynchronously throughout the mesohyl. The influence of environmental parameters relevant to C. foliascens reproduction [i.e., sea surface temperature (SST), photoperiod, and rainfall] was also examined, and SST was found to have the most significant effect on phenology. C. foliascens reproduction exhibited annual mono-cyclic patterns closely resembling SST fluctuations. Reproductive output was depressed at low SST (< 23 A degrees C) and increased at temperatures above 23 A degrees C. Peak sperm release occurred at temperatures above 25 A degrees C, while peak larval release occurred during the annual temperature maxima (> 28 A degrees C). A twofold increase in maximum larval production (PoSPi) in C. foliascens was observed in the second reproductive cycle, following a depressed PoSPi in the first cycle. This reduction in PoSPi in the first reproductive cycle was associated with elevated SST and rainfall, coinciding with one of the strongest La Nia events on record.","[Wahab, M. A.

Cellular diagnostics present an approach to defining indicators (biomarkers) that have the potential to reflect the impact of stress at the cellular level, allowing for the detection of intracellular changes in corals prior to outright mortality. Detoxification enzymes, which may be readily induced or inhibited by environmental stressors, present such a set of indicators. However, in order to apply these diagnostic tools for the detection of stress, a detailed understanding of their normal, homeostatic levels within healthy corals must first be established. Herein, we present molecular and biochemical evidence for the expression and activity of major Phase I detoxification enzymes cytochrome P450 (CYP450), CYP2E1, and CYP450 reductase, as well as the Phase II enzymes UDP, glucuronosyltransferase (UGT), beta-glucuronidase, glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and arylsulfatase C (ASC) in the coral Pocillopora damicornis. Additionally, we characterized enzyme expression and activity variations over a reproductive cycle within a coral's life history to determine natural endogenous changes devoid of stress exposure. Significant changes in enzyme activity over the coral's natural lunar reproductive cycle were observed for CYP2E1 and CYP450 reductase as well as UGT and GST, while beta-glucuronidase and ASC did not fluctuate significantly. The data represent a baseline description of 'health' for the expression and activity of these enzymes that can be used toward understanding the impact of environmental stressors on corals. Such knowledge can be applied to address causes of coral reef ecosystem decline and to monitor effectiveness of mitigation strategies. Achieving a better understanding of cause-and-effect relationships between putative stressors and biological responses in corals, and other marine invertebrates, can guide and evaluate mitigation and conservation approaches for marine ecosystem protection.","[Rougee, L.

Carteriospongia foliascens is a common Indo-Pacific sponge, which has been reported from the intertidal to the mesophotic. Interestingly, the distribution of C. foliascens at inshore reefs of the Great Barrier Reef is restricted to the intertidal with no individuals evident in adjacent subtidal habitats. The abundance of C. foliascens and substrate availability was first quantified to investigate the influence of substrate limitation on adult distribution. Pre-settlement processes of larval spawning, swimming speeds, phototaxis, vertical migration, and settlement to intertidal and subtidal substrate cues were also quantified. Notably, suitable settlement substrate (coral rubble) was not limiting in subtidal habitats. C. foliascens released up to 765 brooded larvae sponge(-1) day(-1) during the day, with larvae (80%+/- 5.77) being negatively phototactic and migrating to the bottom within 40 minutes from release. Subsequently, larvae (up to 58.67%+/- 2.91) migrated to the surface after the loss of the daylight cue (nightfall), and after 34 h post-release >98.67% (+/- 0.67) of larvae had adopted a benthic habit regardless of light conditions. Intertidal and subtidal biofilms initiated similar settlement responses, inducing faster (as early 6 h post-release) and more successful metamorphosis (>60%) than unconditioned surfaces. C. foliascens has a high larval supply and larval behaviours that support recruitment to the subtidal. The absence of C. foliascens in subtidal habitats at inshore reefs is therefore proposed to be a potential consequence of post-settlement mortalities.","[Wahab, Muhammad Azmi Abdul] James Cook Univ, AIMS JCU, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Wahab, Muhammad Azmi Abdul; de Nys, Rocky] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Wahab, Muhammad Azmi Abdul; Webster, Nicole] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Whalan, Steve] So Cross Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Marine Ecol Res Ctr, Lismore, NSW 2480, Australia",11,10.1371/journal.pone.0098181,2014

Despite its prominence and ecological importance, the origins and assembly of the reef fish fauna is poorly described. A patchy fossil record suggests that the major colonization of reef habitats must have occurred in the Late Cretaceous and early Palaeogene, with the earliest known modern fossil coral reef fish assemblage dated to 50 Ma. Using a phylogenetic approach, we analysed the early evolutionary dynamics of modern reef fishes. We find that reef lineages successively colonized reef habitats throughout the Late Cretaceous and early Palaeogene. Two waves of invasion were accompanied by increasing morphological convergence: one in the Late Cretaceous from 90 to 72 Ma and the other immediately following the end-Cretaceous mass extinction. The surge in reef invasions after the Cretaceous-Palaeogene boundary continued for 10 Myr, after which the pace of transitions to reef habitats slowed. Combined, these patterns match a classic niche-filling scenario: early transitions to reefs were made rapidly by morphologically distinct lineages and were followed by a decrease in the rate of invasions and eventual saturation of morphospace. Major alterations in reef composition, distribution and abundance, along with shifts in climate and oceanic currents, occurred during the Late Cretaceous and early Palaeogene interval. A causal mechanism between these changes and concurrent episodes of reef invasion remains obscure, but what is clear is that the broad framework of the modern reef fish fauna was in place within 10 Myr of the end-Cretaceous extinction.","[Price, S.

Marine protected areas (MPAs) that incorporate traditional beliefs about reef tenure are generally more successful in reaching conservation goals and ensuring the participation of local fishermen on vulnerable tropical reef systems. Fiji possesses a unique system of traditional reef management in which local clans or villages, called mataqali, control individual units of a reef, known as qoliqoli, and make independent management decisions based on traditional beliefs and conservation concerns. This is an example of a system, known as customary marine tenure, which has attracted interest from conservation scientists hoping to set up MPAs in vulnerable regions. As one example of this grassroots participation, Nagigi village on the Fijian island of Vanua Levu has expressed interest in setting up an MPA in part of its qoliqoli because of concerns about overfishing. In response to this interest, we took a two-pronged approach to assessing Nagigi's fishery status and conservation needs, first conducting a fishery-independent species survey using destructive sampling and then focusing on fisheries targets identified through fisher interviews. These interviews allowed us to identify heavily targeted species, assess villagers' understanding of reef dynamics over 30 or 40 years of fisheries expansion, and evaluate village support and expectations for a proposed conservation program. Based on our findings we recommend a temporary closure to be in effect for at least three years, allowing one of the more important fishery targets, Lethrinus harak (Forsskal, 1775; Lethrinidae), to complete at least one generation within the reserve. The methodology of matching the proposed marine protected area with the life histories and ecologies of heavily targeted species identified through fisherman and -woman interviews can offer a template for future conservation projects that seek to synthesize indigenous peoples' needs and knowledge with ecological data.","[Golden, Abigail S.; Drew, Joshua A.] Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Naisilsisili, Waisea] Wildlife Conservat Soc Fiji, Suva, Fiji; [Ligairi, Isikele] Univ S Pacific, Suva, Fiji",14,10.1371/journal.pone.0098036,2014

Fast production of marine habitat maps promotes the use of habitat-only conservation plans, where a given percentage of the area of each habitat is set as conservation objectives. However, marine reserves can impact access to fishing grounds and generate opportunity costs for fishers that need to be minimized. In New Caledonia (Southwest Pacific), we used fine-scale fishery catch maps to define nineteen opportunity costs layers (expressed as biomass catch loss) considering i) total catches, ii) target fish families, iii) local marine tenure, and iv) gear type. The expected lower impacts on fishery catch when using the different cost constraints were ranked according to effectiveness in decreasing the costs generated by the habitat-only scenarios. The exercise was done for two habitat maps with different thematic richness. In most cases, habitat conservation objectives remained achievable, but effectiveness varied widely between scenarios and between habitat maps. The results provide practical guidelines for coral reef conservation and management. Habitat-only scenarios can be used to initiate conservation projects with stakeholders but the costs induced by such scenarios can be lowered by up to 50-60% when detailed exhaustive fishery data are used.

During the initiation of symbiosis, majority of corals acquire their own zooxanthellae (specifically from the dinoflagellate genus Symbiodinium) from surrounding environments. The mechanisms underlying the initial establishment of symbiosis have attracted much interest, and numerous field and laboratory experiments have been conducted to elucidate this establishment. However, it is still unclear whether the host corals selectively or randomly acquire their symbionts from surrounding environments. To address this issue, we initially compared genetic compositions of Symbiodinium within naturally settled about 2-week-old Acropora coral juveniles (recruits) and those in the adjacent seawater as the potential symbiont source. We then performed infection tests using several types of Symbiodinium culture strains and apo-symbiotic (does not have Symbiodinium cells yet) Acropora coral larvae. Our field observations indicated apparent preference toward specific Symbiodinium genotypes (A1 and D1-4) within the recruits, despite a rich abundance of other Symbiodinium in the environmental population pool. Laboratory experiments were in accordance with this field observation: Symbiodinium strains of type A1 and D1-4 showed higher infection rates for Acropora larvae than other genotype strains, even when supplied at lower cell densities. Subsequent attraction tests revealed that three Symbiodinium strains were attracted toward Acropora larvae, and within them, only A1 and D1-4 strains were acquired by the larvae. Another three strains did not intrinsically approach to the larvae. These findings suggest the initial establishment of corals-Symbiodinium symbiosis is not random, and the infection mechanism appeared to comprise two steps: initial attraction step and subsequent selective uptake by the coral.","[Yamashita, Hiroshi; Suzuki, Go; Kai, Sayaka; Hayashibara, Takeshi] Fisheries Res Agcy, Seikai Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Res Ctr Subtrop Fisheries, Ishigaki, Okinawa, Japan; [Koike, Kazuhiko] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Biosphere Sci, Higashihiroshima, Hiroshima 724, Japan",14,10.1371/journal.pone.0097003,2014

Understanding these consequences is important to improving these policies and finding opportunities to align economic development with natural resource conservation. These issues are of particular interest to governments and non-governmental organizations that have new mandates to pursue multiple benefits. In this case study, we examined the direct and indirect economic and ecological effects of an increase in the government-controlled price for the primary agricultural product in the Republic of Kiribati, Central Pacific. Methods/Principal Findings: We conducted household surveys and underwater visual surveys of the coral reef to examine how the government increase in the price of copra directly affected copra labor and indirectly affected fishing and the coral reef ecosystem. The islands of Kiribati are coral reef atolls and the majority of households participate in copra agriculture and fishing on the coral reefs. Our household survey data suggest that the 30% increase in the price of copra resulted in a 32% increase in copra labor and a 38% increase in fishing labor. Households with the largest amount of land in coconut production increased copra labor the most and households with the smallest amount of land in coconut production increased fishing the most. Our ecological data suggests that increased fishing labor may result in a 20% decrease in fish stocks and 4% decrease in coral reef-builders. Conclusions/Significance: We provide empirical evidence to suggest that the government increase in the copra price in Kiribati had unexpected and indirect economic and ecological consequences. In this case, the economic development policy was not in alignment with conservation.

Gnathiid isopods are blood-feeding ectoparasites that infest a wide range of fish hosts, mostly in coral reef habitats. They are ecologically similar to terrestrial ticks, with the ability to transmit blood-borne parasites and cause damage or even death to heavily infected hosts. Therefore, being highly resistant or highly susceptible to gnathiids can have significant fitness consequences for reef-associated fishes. Indo-Pacific red lionfish (Pterois volitans) have invaded coastal habitats of the western tropical and subtropical Atlantic and Caribbean regions. We assessed the susceptibility of red lionfish to parasitic gnathiid isopods in both their native Pacific and introduced Atlantic ranges via experimental field studies during which lionfish and other, ecologically-similar reef fishes were caged and exposed to gnathiid infestation on shallow coral reefs. Lionfish in both ranges had very few gnathiids when compared with other species, suggesting that lionfish are not highly susceptible to infestation by generalist ectoparasitic gnathiids. While this pattern implies that release from gnathiid infestation is unlikely to contribute to the success of lionfish as invaders, it does suggest that in environments with high gnathiid densities, lionfish may have an advantage over species that are more susceptible to gnathiids. Also, because lionfish are not completely resistant to gnathiids, our results suggest that lionfish could possibly have transported blood parasites between their native Pacific and invaded Atlantic ranges.","[Sikkel, Paul C.; Coile, Ann Marie] Arkansas State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Jonesboro, AR 72401 USA; [Tuttle, Lillian J.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Cure, Katherine] Univ Guam, Marine Lab, Mangilao, GU 96923 USA; [Cure, Katherine] Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Cure, Katherine] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Hixon, Mark A.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Biol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",21,10.1371/journal.pone.0095854,2014

Using field observations, we explored whether eight species of coral reef fish display modality in their swimming behaviour, which is a convergence in fin use patterns among and within species when they conduct daily activities (e.g. feeding, travelling, chasing). While a range of different fins were used during steady swimming by each species, most fishes converged towards median-paired fin use (e.g. pelvics, pectorals) when undertaking searching and feeding. Conversely, all species adopted caudal fin use during high-speed activities such as chasing. Such modality in fin use was relatively conserved across juvenile and adult conspecifics and transcended differences in phylogenetic history and trophic preferences, suggesting that overarching constraints underpin patterns of fish swimming behaviour in complex habitats.","[Pink, J.

As coral reefs face multiple stressors, the distribution and abundance of corals will depend on the successful dispersal and settlement of coral larvae under changing environmental conditions. To explore this scenario, we used metabolic rate, at holobiont and molecular levels, as an index for assessing the physiological plasticity of Pocillopora damicornis larvae from this site to conditions of ocean acidity and warming. Larvae were incubated for 6 hours in seawater containing combinations of CO2 concentration (450 and 950 mu atm) and temperature (28 and 30 degrees C). Rates of larval oxygen consumption were higher at elevated temperatures. In contrast, high CO2 levels elicited depressed metabolic rates, especially for larvae released later in the spawning period. Rates of citrate synthase, a rate-limiting enzyme in aerobic metabolism, suggested a biochemical limit for increasing oxidative capacity in coral larvae in a warming, acidifying ocean. Biological responses were also compared between larvae released from adult colonies on the same day (cohorts). The metabolic physiology of Pocillopora damicornis larvae varied significantly by day of release. Additionally, we used environmental data collected on a reef in Moorea, French Polynesia to provide information about what adult corals and larvae may currently experience in the field. An autonomous pH sensor provided a continuous time series of pH on the natal fringing reef. In February/March, 2011, pH values averaged 8.075 +/- 0.023. Our results suggest that without adaptation or acclimatization, only a portion of naive Pocillopora damicornis larvae may have suitable metabolic phenotypes for maintaining function and fitness in an end-of-the century ocean.","[Rivest, Emily B.; Hofmann, Gretchen E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",30,10.1371/journal.pone.0096172,2014

Reef platform sediment production is estimated at 569 m(3) yr(-1) using rate laws that express gross community carbonate production as a function of seawater aragonite saturation, community composition and rugosity and incorporating estimates of carbonate removal from the reef system. Key carbonate producers including hard coral, crustose coralline algae and Halimeda are mapped accurately (mean R-2 = 0.81). Community net production estimates correspond closely to independent census-based estimates made in-situ (R-2 = 0.86). Reef-scale outputs are compared with historic rates of production generated from (i) radiocarbon evidence of island deposition initiation around 3200 years ago, and (ii) island volume calculated from a high resolution island digital elevation model. Contemporary carbonate production rates appear to be remarkably similar to historical values of 573 m(3) yr(-1). Anticipated future seawater chemistry parameters associated with an RCP8.5 emissions scenario are employed to model rates of net community calcification for the period 2000-2100 on the basis of an inorganic aragonite precipitation law, under the assumption of constant benthic community character. Simulations indicate that carbonate production will decrease linearly to a level of 118 m(3) yr(-1) by 2100 and that by 2150 aragonite saturation levels may no longer support the positive budgetary status necessary to sustain island accretion. Novel aspects of this assessment include the development of rate law parameters to realistically represent the variable composition of coral reef benthic carbonate producers, incorporation of three dimensional rugosity of the entire reef platform and the coupling of model outputs with both historical radiocarbon dating evidence and forward hydrochemical projections to conduct an assessment of island evolution through time. By combining several lines of evidence in a deterministic manner, an assessment of changes in carbonate production is carried out that has tangible geomorphic implications for sediment availability and associated island evolution.","Univ Wollongong, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Wollongong, NSW, Australia",6,10.1371/journal.pone.0094067,2014

There was a strong correlation between the number of grey reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) observed by dive guides and the telemetry data at both daily and monthly intervals, suggesting that variation in relative abundance of sharks was detectable in datasets collected by dive guides in a similar manner to data derived from telemetry at these time scales. There was no correlation between the number or mean depth of sharks recorded by telemetry and the presence of tourist divers, suggesting that the behaviour of sharks was not affected by the presence of divers during our study. Data recorded by dive guides showed that current strength and temperature were important drivers of the relative abundance of sharks at monitored sites.

Using ecologically relevant morphological metrics, we investigated the evolution of herbivory in surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae) and rabbitfishes (Siganidae). Eocene and Recent surgeonfishes showed remarkable similarities, with grazers, browsers and even specialized, long-snouted forms having Eocene analogues. These long-snouted Eocene species were probably pair-forming, crevice-feeding forms like their Recent counterparts. Although Eocene surgeonfishes likely played a critical role as herbivores during the origins of modern coral reefs, they lacked the novel morphologies seen in modern Acanthurus and Siganus (including eyes positioned high above their low-set mouths). Today, these forms dominate coral reefs in both abundance and species richness and are associated with feeding on shallow, exposed algal turfs. The radiation of these new forms, and their expansion into new habitats in the Oligocene-Miocene, reflects the second phase in the development of fish herbivory on coral reefs that is closely associated with the exploitation of highly productive short algal turfs.","[Bellwood, D.

Coral reefs in this region host a high proportion of endemics compared to total species richness and they are particularly threatened by human activities. The island archipelagos with their diverse marine habitats constitute a natural laboratory for studying diversification processes. Rocky shores in the SWIO region have remained understudied. This habitat presents a high diversity of molluscs, in particular gastropods. To explore the role of climatic and geological factors in lineage diversification within the genus Nerita, we constructed a new phylogeny with an associated chronogram from two mitochondrial genes [cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 and 16S rRNA], combining previously published and new data from eight species sampled throughout the region. All species from the SWIO originated less than 20 Ma ago, their closest extant relatives living in the Indo-Australian Archipelago (IAA). Furthermore, the SWIO clades within species with Indo-Pacific distribution ranges are quite recent, less than 5 Ma. These results suggest that the regional diversification of Nerita is closely linked to tectonic events in the SWIO region. The Reunion mantle plume head reached Earth's surface 67 Ma and has been stable and active since then, generating island archipelagos, some of which are partly below sea level today. Since the Miocene, sea-level fluctuations have intermittently created new rocky shore habitats. These represent ephemeral stepping-stones, which have likely facilitated repeated colonization by intertidal gastropods, like Nerita populations from the IAA, leading to allopatric speciation. This highlights the importance of taking into account past climatic and geological factors when studying diversification of highly dispersive tropical marine species. It also underlines the unique history of the marine biodiversity of the SWIO region.","[Postaire, Bautisse; Bruggemann, J.

Regional-scale interactions between climate change, biogeography and fisheries management remain poorly understood. Here, we evaluated large-scale patterns of coral communities in the western Indian Ocean after a major coral bleaching event in 1998. We surveyed 291 coral reef sites in 11 countries and over 30 degrees of latitude between 2004 and 2011 to evaluate variations in coral communities post 1998 across gradients in latitude, mainland-island geography and fisheries management. We used linear mixed-effect hierarchical models to assess total coral cover, the abundance of four major coral families (acroporids, faviids, pocilloporids and poritiids), coral genus richness and diversity, and the bleaching susceptibility of the coral communities. We found strong latitudinal and geographic gradients in coral community structure and composition that supports the presence of a high coral cover and diversity area that harbours temperature-sensitive taxa in the northern Mozambique Channel between Tanzania, northern Mozambique and northern Madagascar. Coral communities in the more northern latitudes of Kenya, Seychelles and the Maldives were generally composed of fewer bleaching-tolerant coral taxa and with reduced richness and diversity. There was also evidence for continued declines in the abundance of temperature-sensitive taxa and community change after 2004. While there are limitations of our regional dataset in terms of spatial and temporal replication, these patterns suggest that large-scale interactions between biogeographic factors and strong temperature anomalies influence coral communities while smaller-scale factors, such as the effect of fisheries closures, were weak. The northern Mozambique Channel, while not immune to temperature disturbances, shows continued signs of resistance to climate disturbances and remains a priority for future regional conservation and management actions.","[McClanahan, Timothy R.; Ateweberhan, Mebrahtu; Muthiga, Nyawira A.] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Marine Programs, Bronx, NY USA; [Ateweberhan, Mebrahtu] Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Darling, Emily S.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Earth Ocean Res Grp, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Graham, Nicholas A.

This study compared the effects of decreased pH on the microstructural features of both in hospite (within the colony) and isolated sclerites (in the absence of tissue protection) of the zooxanthellate reef-dwelling octocoral Ovabunda macrospiculata. Colonies and isolated sclerites were maintained under normal (8.2) and reduced (7.6 and 7.3) pH conditions for up to 42 days. Both in hospite and isolated sclerites were then examined under SEM and ESEM microscopy in order to detect any microstructural changes. No differences were found in the microstructure of the in hospite sclerites between the control and the pH treatments. In stark contrast, the isolated sclerites revealed dissolution damage related to the acidity of the water. These findings suggest a protective role of the octocoral tissue against adverse pH conditions, thus maintaining them unharmed at high pCO(2). In light of the competition for space with the less resilient reef calcifiers, octocorals may thus have a significant advantage under greater than normal acidic conditions.","[Gabay, Yasmin; Barkay, Zahava; Benayahu, Yehuda] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Gabay, Yasmin; Fine, Maoz] Interuniv Inst Marine Sci, Elat, Israel; [Fine, Maoz] Bar Ilan Univ, Mina & Everard Goodman Fac Life Sci, Ramat Gan, Israel",14,10.1371/journal.pone.0091553,2014

When hunting is carried out for conservation, for example to control invasive species, these behavioural changes can inadvertently impede the success of future efforts. We examined the effects of repeated culling by spearing on the behaviour of invasive predatory lionfish (Pterois volitans/miles) on Bahamian coral reef patches. We compared the extent of concealment and activity levels of lionfish at dawn and midday on 16 coral reef patches off Eleuthera, The Bahamas. Eight of the patches had been subjected to regular daytime removals of lionfish by spearing for two years. We also estimated the distance at which lionfish became alert to slowly approaching divers on culled and unculled reef patches. Lionfish on culled reefs were less active and hid deeper within the reef during the day than lionfish on patches where no culling had occurred. There were no differences at dawn when removals do not take place. Lionfish on culled reefs also adopted an alert posture at a greater distance from divers than lionfish on unculled reefs. More crepuscular activity likely leads to greater encounter rates by lionfish with more native fish species because the abundance of reef fish outside of shelters typically peaks at dawn and dusk. Hiding deeper within the reef could also make remaining lionfish less likely to be encountered and more difficult to catch by spearfishers during culling efforts. Shifts in the behaviour of hunted invasive animals might be common and they have implications both for the impact of invasive species and for the design and success of invasive control programs.","[Cote, Isabelle M.; Darling, Emily S.; Malpica-Cruz, Luis; Smith, Nicola S.; Green, Stephanie J.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Earth Oceans Res Grp, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Smith, Nicola S.] Marine Resources & Local Govt, Dept Marine Resources, Minist Agr, Nassau, Bahamas; [Curtis-Quick, Jocelyn] Cape Eleuthera Inst, Rock Sound, Eleuthera, Bahamas; [Layman, Craig] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Appl Ecol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",31,10.1371/journal.pone.0094248,2014

Analogous temporal disparities exist in other systems and are a largely unrecognized obstacle in attaining sustainable ecosystem services in an increasingly human impacted world.

Given the environmental variability intertidal reefs experience, such reefs may potentially be more resilient to climatic events and provide important insights into the adaptation of reef fauna to future ocean warming. Here we report the results of a 17-year (1995-2011) biodiversity survey of four emergent coral reef ecosystems in Bahia, Brazil, to assess the impact of a major El Nino event on the reef fauna, and determine any subsequent recovery. The densities of two species of coral, Favia gravida and Siderastrea stellata, did not vary significantly across the survey period, indicating a high degree of tolerance to the El Nino associated stress. However, there were marked decreases in the diversity of other taxa. Molluscs, bryozoans and ascidians suffered severe declines in diversity and abundance and had not recovered to pre-El Nino levels by the end of the study. Echinoderms were reduced to a single species in 1999, Echinometra lucunter, although diversity levels had recovered by 2002. Sponge assemblages were not impacted by the 1997-8 event and their densities had increased by the study end. Multivariate analysis indicated that a stable invertebrate community had re-established on the reefs after the El Nino event, but it has a different overall composition to the pre-El Nino community. It is unclear if community recovery will continue given more time, but our study highlights that any increase in the frequency of large-scale climatic events to more than one a decade is likely to result in a persistent lower-diversity state. Our results also suggest some coral and sponge species are particularly resilient to the El Nino-associated stress and therefore represent suitable models to investigate temperature adaptation in reef organisms.","[Kelmo, Francisco; Mariano-Neto, Eduardo] Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Biol, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Bell, James J.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington, New Zealand; [Moraes, Simone Souza] Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Geociencias, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Tourinho Gomes, Rilza da Costa] Fundacao Visconde Cairu, Curso Posgrad Desenvolvimento Humano & Responsabi, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Attrill, Martin J.] Univ Plymouth, Drake Circus, Inst Marine, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",5,10.1371/journal.pone.0093209,2014

Hundreds of females emigrate seasonally from remote populations (>50 km away) to lay their eggs in these coastal nurseries, and then return home. Protecting these nurseries is a priority to maintain recruitment rate, and to retain sea krait populations in the future.","[Bonnet, Xavier; Brischoux, Francois; Fauvel, Thomas] CNRS, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, Unite Mixte Rech 7372, Villiers En Bois, France; [Bonnet, Xavier; Brischoux, Francois; Fauvel, Thomas] Univ La Rochelle, Villiers En Bois, France; [Bonnet, Christophe] Ctr Hosp Terr Gaston Bourret, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Plichon, Patrice] Direct Environm, Noumea, Province Sud, New Caledonia; [Fauvel, Thomas] Univ Paris 06, Paris, France",7,10.1371/journal.pone.0090246,2014

However, deeper waters are increasingly recognised as a potential source of refuge that may help sustain fishery resources. We used a combination of historical catch data over a 20-year time period and fishery-independent surveys to investigate the effects of SCUBA spearfishing on coral reef fish populations in the southern Mariana Islands. Two jurisdictions were studied; Guam, where SCUBA spearfishing is practiced, and the nearby Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), where SCUBA spearfishing has been banned since 2003. Fishery-independent data were collected using baited remote underwater stereo-video systems (stereo-BRUVs) stratified by depth, marine protected area status and jurisdiction. Herbivores (primary consumers) dominated spearfishing catches, with parrotfish (scarines) and surgeonfish/unicornfish (acanthurids) the main groups harvested. However, the large, endangered humphead wrasse (Cheilinus undulatus) was the main species by weight landed by SCUBA spearfishers. SCUBA spearfishing was associated with declining size of scarines over time and catches shifting from a dominance of large parrotfishes to a mixed assemblage with increasing proportions of acanthurids. Comparisons between Guam and the nearby CNMI revealed differences in the assemblage of fished species and also greater size of scarines and acanthurids in deep water where SCUBA fishing is banned. These results suggest that SCUBA spearfishing impacts reef fish populations and that the restriction of this fishing method will ensure refuge for fish populations in deeper waters. We recommend a ban on SCUBA spearfishing to preserve or aid the recovery of large, functionally important coral reef species and to improve the sustainability of coral reef fisheries.","[Lindfield, Steven J.] Univ Western Australia, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, UWA Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Lindfield, Steven J.] Univ Western Australia, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Sch Plant Biol, Crawley, WA, Australia; [McIlwain, Jennifer L.; Harvey, Euan S.] Curtin Univ, Dept Environm & Agr, Bentley, WA, Australia",43,10.1371/journal.pone.0092628,2014

Barrel sponges are one of the largest and most conspicuous members of the coral reef fauna across the Indo-Pacific and given their large size, longevity and ability to process large volumes of water, they have a major role in reef functioning. Here we used a panel of microsatellite markers to characterise the genetic structure of two barrel sponge species, Xestospongia testudinaria and a currently undescribed Xestospongia species. We sampled across seven populations in the Wakatobi Marine National Park, SE Sulawesi (Indonesia) spanning a spatial scale of approximately 2 to 70 km, and present the first estimates of demographic connectivity for coral reef sponges. Genetic analyses showed high levels of genetic differentiation between all populations for both species, but contrasting patterns of genetic structuring for the two species. Autocorrelation analyses showed the likely dispersal distances of both species to be in the order of 60 and 140 m for Xestopongia sp. and Xestospongia testudinaria, respectively, which was supported by assignment tests that showed high levels of self-recruitment (>80%). We also found consistently high inbreeding coefficients across all populations for both species. Our study highlights the potential susceptibility of barrel sponges to environmental perturbations because they are generally long-lived, slow growing, have small population sizes and are likely to be reliant on self-recruitment. Surprisingly, despite these features we actually found the highest abundance of both barrel sponge species (although they were generally smaller) at a site that has been severely impacted by humans over the last fifty years. This suggests that barrel sponges exhibit environmental adaptation to declining environmental quality and has important implications for the management and conservation of these important reef species.","[Bell, James J.; Hannan, Danielle] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington, New Zealand; [Smith, David] Univ Essex, Coral Reef Res Unit, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Haris, Abdul; Jompa, Jamaludin] Hasanuddin Univ, Res & Dev Ctr Marine Coastal & Small Isl, Makassar, Indonesia; [Thomas, Luke] Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, Oceans Inst, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia",18,10.1371/journal.pone.0091635,2014

These results shed light on our understanding of coral's response toward light changes and the genome-wide interaction among genes under the control of biorhythm, and hence help us to better protect the coral reef ecosystems.

We currently lack an understanding of how climate change stressors, such as ocean acidification (OA) and warming, may simultaneously affect coral reef disease dynamics, particularly diseases threatening key reef-building organisms, for example crustose coralline algae (CCA). Here, we use coralline fungal disease (CFD), a previously described CCA disease from the Pacific, to examine these simultaneous effects using both field observations and experimental manipulations. We identify the associated fungus as belonging to the subphylum Ustilaginomycetes and show linear lesion expansion rates on individual hosts can reach 6.5 mm per day. Further, we demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that ocean-warming events could increase the frequency of CFD outbreaks on coral reefs, but that OA-induced lowering of pH may ameliorate outbreaks by slowing lesion expansion rates on individual hosts. Lowered pH may still reduce overall host survivorship, however, by reducing calcification and facilitating fungal bio-erosion. Such complex, interactive effects between simultaneous extrinsic environmental stressors on disease dynamics are important to consider if we are to accurately predict the response of coral reef communities to future climate change.","[Williams, Gareth J.; Price, Nichole N.; Johnson, Maggie D.; Smith, Jennifer E.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Ctr Marine Biodivers & Conservat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Ushijima, Blake; Callahan, Sean; Shore-Maggio, Amanda; Videau, Patrick] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Microbiol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Gove, Jamison M.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Joint Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Ushijima, Blake; Aeby, Greta S.; Knapp, Ingrid S.; Shore-Maggio, Amanda] Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; [Davy, Simon K.; Knapp, Ingrid S.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington, New Zealand; [Gove, Jamison M.] NOAA, Coral Reef Ecosyst Div, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96814 USA; [Work, Thierry M.] US Geol Survey, Natl Wildlife Hlth Ctr, Honolulu Field Stn, Honolulu, HI 96850 USA",25,10.1098/rspb.2013.3069,2014

However, the detailed physiological responses of LBF holobionts to temperature ranges occurring in their habitats are not known. We report net oxygen (O-2) production and respiration rates of three LBF holobionts (Baculogypsina sphaerulata and Calcarina gaudichaudii hosting diatom symbionts, and Amphisorus kudakajimensis hosting dinoflagellate symbionts) measured in the laboratory at water temperatures ranging from 5 degrees C to 45 degrees C in 2.5 degrees C or 5 degrees C intervals and with light saturation levels of similar to 500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). In addition, the recovery of net O-2 production and respiration rates after exposure to temperature stress was assessed. The net O-2 production and respiration rates of the three LBF holobionts peaked at similar to 30 degrees C, indicating their optimal temperature for a short exposure period. At extreme high temperatures (>= 40 degrees C), the net O-2 production rates of all three LBF holobionts declined to less than zero and the respiration rates slightly decreased, indicating that photosynthesis of algal symbionts was inactivated. At extreme low temperatures (<= 10 degrees C for two calcarinid species and <= 5 degrees C for A. kudakajimensis), the net O-2 production and respiration rates were near zero, indicating a weakening of holobiont activity. After exposure to extreme high or low temperature, the net O-2 production rates did not recover until the following day, whereas the respiration rates recovered rapidly, suggesting that a longer time (days) is required for recovery from damage to the photosystem by temperature stress compared to the respiration system. These results indicate that the oxygen metabolism of LBF holobionts can generally cope well with conditions that fluctuate diurnally and seasonally in their habitats. However, temporal heat and cold stresses with high light levels may induce severe damage to algal symbionts and also damage to host foraminifers.","[Fujita, Kazuhiko; Okai, Takaaki] Univ Ryukyus, Dept Phys & Earth Sci, Nishihara, Okinawa 90301, Japan; [Hosono, Takashi] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Tokyo 113, Japan",12,10.1371/journal.pone.0090304,2014

Management agencies must strike a balance between their capacity constraints and the requisites of management measures. Most small-scale sea cucumber fisheries of Pacific Islands have been plundered while others are being opened to commercial exploitation. Data from fishery managers and a regional workshop were used to assess the current problems, institutional constraints and solutions to the management of sea cucumber fisheries in 13 Pacific Island countries (PICs). Technical capacity was often strong for some management actions such as developing marine reserves but weak for others, such as enforcement. Using multi-disciplinary indicators, half of the fisheries were diagnosed by their managers as being overfished or depleted, despite evidence of optimistic bias. Fishery governance varied greatly among the PICs, and co-management frameworks were not typical of any cultural region. Management objectives were prioritised differently among managers but most highly ranked was to protect ecological resilience. The fishery managers proposed different sets of regulatory measures and various management actions, such as surveys to collect socio-economic and fishery-dependent data, support for local governance and strong enforcement - all widely under-practised. Pacific sea cucumber fisheries exemplify how the transition to an EAF by management institutions must involve reorganisation of their technical and human-resource capacities among management tasks. Levies on exports need to be internalised to fund improved management. Management agencies should consider a shift in resources from developing marine reserves, conducting underwater surveys and aquaculture-based restocking to strengthening enforcement capacity, stakeholder involvement and communication with fishers. In concert with these actions, short fishing seasons, shortlists of allowable species and tighter enforcement at export points may serve to turn the tide on boom-and-bust exploitation and safeguard biodiversity.

The abundance of fish recruits was recorded using underwater visual census at six macroalgal and 11 coral reef sites in the Montebello and Barrow Islands. Surveys identified 6,935 individual recruit fish from 105 species, 54 genera and 20 families. Of these, 1,401 recruits from 48 species, 31 genera and 14 families were observed in macroalgal sites. Sixteen of the 105 recruit species (15.2 %) were observed exclusively at macroalgal sites. Forty-two (87.5 %) of these species have been observed as adults on adjacent coral reefs. Species composition of fish recruits differed significantly between the two habitats. Corallivore, small omnivore and zooplanktivore recruits had significantly higher numbers in the coral sites, while the results clearly demonstrate that juveniles, within the genera Lethrinus and Choerodon, as well as large algal croppers, are predominantly found at macroalgal (74-100 %) rather than coral-dominated sites. High-canopy macroalgae cover was positively correlated with abundance of these taxa, particularly Lethrinids (r (2) = 0.40). This study is the first to highlight the important attributes of tropical macroalgal fields and suggests that they have a similar role to seagrass meadows as essential juvenile habitat, thus warranting greater attention in conservation planning and ecological studies.","[Evans, R.

In this study, we refined low technology culture and transplantation approaches and assessed the role of colony size and age, at time of transfer from nursery to reef, on subsequent survival. Larvae from Acropora millepora were reared from gametes and settled on engineered substrates, called coral plug-ins, that were designed to simplify transplantation to areas of degraded reef. Plug-ins, with laboratory spawned and settled coral recruits attached, were maintained in nurseries until they were at least 7 months old before being transplanted to replicate coral limestone outcrops within a marine protected area until they were 31 months old. Survival rates of transplanted corals that remained at the protected in situ nursery the longest were 3.9-5.6 times higher than corals transplanted to the reef earlier, demonstrating that an intermediate ocean nursery stage is critical in the sexual propagation of corals for reef rehabilitation. 3 years post-settlement, colonies were reproductively mature, making this one of few published studies to date to rear a broadcasting scleractinian from eggs to spawning adults. While our data show that it is technically feasible to transplant sexually propagated corals and rear them until maturity, producing a single 2.5-year-old coral on the reef cost at least US$60. 'What if' scenarios indicate that the cost per transplantable coral could be reduced by almost 80 %, nevertheless, it is likely that the high cost per coral using sexual propagation methods would constrain delivery of new corals to relatively small scales in many countries with coral reefs.","[Guest, J.

However, algal distributions and community assemblages may also rely on the availability of smaller scale spatial refuges within the reef. The results of this study demonstrate that the patterns of macroalgal distribution across the back reef of Moorea, French Polynesia, are maintained by herbivores interacting with the small-scale structural complexities of the coral reef landscape. Although the majority of space available for colonization is composed of exposed surfaces, macroalgae rarely are found in the open. Instead, macroalgal occurrence is highest in the protected narrow crevices and hole microhabitats provided by massive Porites spp. coral heads. These distributions are determined initially by post-settlement mortality of young algal recruits in exposed habitats. Rates of consumption for two of the most common macroalgal species found in refuges across the back reef, Halimeda minima and Amansia rhodantha, indicate that algal recruits in exposed habitats are limited by herbivory. While algal abundance and community structure are highly dependent upon herbivore grazing, the availability of small-scale spatial refuges ultimately shapes the distinct community patterns and distributional boundaries of coral reef macroalgae in the back reefs of Moorea.","[Poray, A.

Scaling of the governing equations shows that this flow is governed by a single parameter P that expresses the competing effects of cross-reef and along-lagoon drag.

Cryptofauna that live deeply embedded within the interstitial spaces of coral reefs make up the majority of reef diversity, and many of these species provide important protective services to their coral hosts. However, we know very little about the processes governing the diversity and composition of these less conspicuous but functionally important species. Here, we experimentally quantify the role of predation in driving the community organization of small fishes and decapods that live embedded within Pocillopora eydouxi, a structurally complex, reef-building coral found widely across the Indo-Pacific. We use surveys to describe the natural distribution of predators, and then, factorially manipulate two focal predator species to quantify the independent and combined effects of predator density and identity on P. eydouxi-dwelling cryptofauna. Predators reduced abundance (34 %), species richness (20 %), and modified species composition. Rarefaction revealed that observed reductions in species richness were primarily driven by changes in abundance. Additionally, the two predator species uniquely affected the beta diversity and composition of the prey assemblage. Predators reduced the abundance and modified the composition of a number of mutualist fishes and decapods, whose benefit to the coral is known to be both diversity- and density-dependent. We predict that the density and identity of predators present within P. eydouxi may substantially alter coral performance in the face of an increased frequency and intensity of natural and anthropogenic stressors.","[Stier, A.

Monitoring and predicting these events have largely utilized sea surface temperature data, due to the convenience of using large-scale remotely sensed satellite measurements. However, coral bleaching has been observed to vary in severity throughout the water column, and variations in coral thermal stress across depths have not yet been well investigated. In this study, in situ water temperature data from 1999 to 2011 from three depths were used to calculate thermal stress on a coral reef in Bahia Almirante, Bocas del Toro, Panama, which was compared to satellite surface temperature data and thermal stress calculations for the same area and time period from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Coral Reef Watch Satellite Bleaching Alert system. The results show similar total cumulative annual thermal stress for both the surface and depth-stratified data, but with a striking difference in the distribution of that stress among the depth strata during different high-temperature events, with the greatest thermal stress unusually recorded at the deepest measured depth during the most severe bleaching event in 2005. Temperature records indicate that a strong density-driven temperature inversion may have formed in this location in that year, contributing to the persistence and intensity of bleaching disturbance at depth. These results indicate that depth may not provide a stress refuge from high water temperature events in some situations, and in this case, the water properties at depth appear to have contributed to greater coral bleaching at depth compared to near-surface locations. This case study demonstrates the importance of incorporating depth-stratified temperature monitoring and small-scale oceanographic and hydrologic data for understanding and predicting local reef responses to elevated water temperature events.","[Neal, B.

Reef predators often forage together, and at high densities, they may either cooperate or antagonize one another, thereby causing prey mortality rates to be substantially higher or lower than one would expect if predators did not interact. However, we have a limited mechanistic understanding of how prey mortality rates change with predator densities. We re-analyzed a previously published observational dataset to investigate how the foraging response of the coney grouper (Cephalopholis fulva) feeding on the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum) changed with shifts in predator and prey densities. Using a model-selection approach, we found that per-predator feeding rates were most consistent with a functional response that declines as predator density increases, suggesting either antagonistic interactions among predators or a shared antipredator behavioral response by the prey. Our findings suggest that variation in predator density (natural or anthropogenic) may have substantial consequences for coral reef fish population dynamics.","[Stier, A.

At present, available connectivity information on Mexican Atlantic reefs is scarce, particularly concerning the Veracruz Reef System (VRS), which is located in the south-western Gulf of Mexico. This study used a hierarchically nested sampling design to evaluate the levels of genetic connectivity both within and between the Mexican Caribbean (MC) and VRS reef regions; all of the studied reefs are marine protected areas. Microsatellites were used as genetic markers, and bicolor damselfish (Stegastes partitus) recruits were used as a biological model. The paired genetic differentiation index between regions (Fst ((ENA)) = 0.008) was lower than the global index (Fst ((ENA)) = 0.027), suggesting that the stronger restrictions to gene flow may be located inside the regions rather than between them. The AMOVA results supported this explanation, as the differences were only non-significant between regions. In the VRS, Santiaguillo reef was associated with low genetic connectivity levels, whilst within the MC region the group formed by Chinchorro Bank and Cozumel exhibited a restriction to gene flow with Puerto Morelos, their northernmost reef. Despite their spatial separation, reefs from different regions (Puerto Morelos and Anegada de Adentro) showed the lowest, albeit significant, genetic difference, meaning that a subtle genetic connectivity exists at the regional scale. The detected composite flow pattern is likely related to self-recruitment and cohesive dispersal processes interacting with current patterns, which may favour genetic connections under specific conditions. The results presented here suggest that coral reef management in the Mexican Atlantic Ocean should consider large scale measures in addition to appropriate local actions to protect reef fish populations.","[Villegas Sanchez, C.

I compare the number of putative annual otolith increments (as a proxy for actual age) and widths of these increments (as proxies for somatic growth) with actual tagged fish-length data, based on a 6-year dataset, the longest time course for a coral reef fish. Estimated age from otoliths corresponded closely with actual age in all cases, confirming annual increment formation. However, otolith increment widths were poor proxies for actual growth in length [linear regression r (2) = 0.44-0.90, n = 6 fish] and were clearly of limited value in estimating annual growth. Up to 60 % of the annual growth variation was missed using otolith increments, suggesting the long-term back calculations of otolith growth characteristics of reef fish populations should be interpreted with caution.","Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Environm, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",2,10.1007/s00338-013-1105-2,2014

Abundance and reproductive patterns of the sponge in a Mexican Pacific coral reef over a 4-year period are herein described. Sponge abundance was estimated along three transects 50 m long which were randomly placed on the reef, and along each one, a piece of coral rubble and a branch of a live coral from the Pocillopora spp. coral colony closest to the transect were collected at random, approximately every 2 m, yielding 25 pieces of each category per transect (and 75 pieces total of each category). A 2-way ANOVA revealed that invasion was significantly higher in living coral colonies (34.8 %) than in rubble (13.7 %). It also indicated that the abundance in both coralline substrates showed a temporal variation without a clear pattern of increase over the years. It was estimated that 60-85 % of sponges in the population reproduced sexually every year. The sponge proved gonochoristic, with a sex ratio strongly departing from parity (1 male: 3 females). Over the 4-year study period, at least two cohorts of oocytes with densities of up to 3.5 oocytes per mm(2) tissue were observed. Spermatogenesis lasted about a month, but often producing more than a pulse from July to November, coupled with peaks of oocyte maturation. Fertilization occurred internally to produce encapsulated zygotes that were released in one or more spawning events from July to November. In the following months (December to February), which were the periods of lowest temperature (similar to 18.5-20 A degrees C), no gametic activity occurred in the sponges. Because anomalous temperature rises that are detrimental to corals do not appear to negatively affect the reproduction and abundance of C. vermifera, it is likely that the excavating activity of this sponge may be compromising the health of those coral reefs that are recurrently affected by episodes of thermal stress.","[Bautista-Guerrero, Eric; Luis Carballo, Jose] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Estn Mazatlan, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Mazatlan 82000, Mexico; [Maldonado, Manuel] CSIC, CEAB, Ctr Adv Studies Blanes, Dept Marine Ecol, Blanes 17300, Girona, Spain",9,10.1007/s00338-013-1094-1,2014

Tissue samples of A. ocellaris (n = 364) and A. perideraion (n = 105) were collected from fringing reefs around two small islands (Barrang Lompo and Samalona) in Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia. Specimens were genotyped based on seven microsatellite loci for A. ocellaris and five microsatellite loci for A. perideraion, and parentage assignment as well as site fidelity were calculated. Both species showed high levels of self-recruitment: 65.2% of juvenile A. ocellaris in Samalona were the progeny of parents from the same island, while on Barrang Lompo 47.4% of A. ocellaris and 46.9% of A. perideraion juveniles had parents from that island. Self-recruitment of A. ocellaris in Barrang Lompo varied from 44% to 52% between the two sampling periods. The site fidelity of A. ocellaris juveniles that returned to their reef site in Barang Lompo was up to 44%, while for A. perideraion up to 19%. In Samalona, the percentage of juveniles that returned to their natal reef site ranged from 8% to 11%. Exchange of progeny between the two study islands, located 7.5 km apart, was also detected via parentage assignments. The larger Samalona adult population of A. ocellaris was identified as the parents of 21% of Barrang Lompo juveniles, while the smaller adult population on Barrang Lompo were the parents of only 4% of Samalona juveniles. High self-recruitment and recruitment to nearby island reefs have important implications for management and conservation of anemonefishes. Small MPAs, preferably on every island/reef, should ensure that a part of the population is protected to enable replenishment by the highly localised recruitment behaviour observed in these species.","[Madduppa, Hawis H.] Bogor Agr Univ IPB, Fac Fisheries & Marine Sci, Bogor, Indonesia; [Timm, Janne] Univ Bremen, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Kochzius, Marc] Vrije Univ Brussel, Brussels, Belgium",9,10.1371/journal.pone.0090648,2014

Although these compound eyes have been known for about two centuries, no visually guided behaviour has ever been directly associated with their presence. There are indications that they are involved in negative phototaxis but this may also be governed by extraocular photoreceptors. Here, we show that the eyes of the coral-reef-associated starfish Linckia laevigata are slow and colour blind. The eyes are capable of true image formation although with low spatial resolution. Further, our behavioural experiments reveal that only specimens with intact eyes can navigate back to their reef habitat when displaced, demonstrating that this is a visually guided behaviour. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of a function of starfish compound eyes. We also show that the spectral sensitivity optimizes the contrast between the reef and the open ocean. Our results provide an example of an eye supporting only low-resolution vision, which is believed to be an essential stage in eye evolution, preceding the high-resolution vision required for detecting prey, predators and conspecifics.","[Garm, Anders] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Sect Marine Biol, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark; [Nilsson, Dan-Eric] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Lund Vis Grp, S-22362 Lund, Sweden",23,10.1098/rspb.2013.3011,2014

However, empirical evidence for a relationship between beta-diversity (spatial turnover in community structure) and temporal stability in community structure remains equivocal, despite important implications for theoretical ecology and conservation biology. Here, we report strong beta-diversity-stability relationships across a broad sample of fish taxa on Australia's Great Barrier Reef. These relationships were robust to random sampling error and spatial and environmental factors, such as latitude, reef size and isolation. While beta-diversity was positively associated with temporal stability at the community level, the relationship was negative for some taxa, for example surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae), one of the most abundant reef fish families. This demonstrates that the beta-diversity-stability relationship should not be indiscriminately assumed for all taxa, but that a species' risk of extirpation in response to disturbance is likely to be taxon specific and trait based. By combining predictions of spatial and temporal turnover across the study area with observations in marine-protected areas, we conclude that protection alone does not necessarily confer temporal stability and that taxon-specific considerations will improve the outcome of conservation efforts.","[Mellin, C.; Caley, M.

We evaluated whether two tropical seaweeds induce allelopathy in response to competition with a reef-building coral. We also assessed the effects of competition on seaweed growth and seaweed chemical defence against herbivores. Following 8 days of competition with the coral Porites cylindrica, the chemically rich seaweed Galaxaura filamentosa induced increased allelochemicals and became nearly twice as damaging to the coral. However, it also experienced significantly reduced growth and increased palatability to herbivores (because of reduced chemical defences). Under the same conditions, the seaweed Sargassum polycystum did not induce allelopathy and did not experience a change in growth or palatability. This is the first demonstration of induced allelopathy in a seaweed, or of competitors reducing seaweed chemical defences against herbivores.

While navigation according to reef-generated chemicals and sounds can significantly affect dispersal, the effect is limited to the vicinity of the reef. Effective long-distance navigation requires at least one other capacity-the ability to maintain a bearing using, for example, a sun compass. Directional information in the sun's position can take the form of polarized-light related cues (i.e., e-vector orientation and percent polarization) and/or non-polarized-light related cues (i.e., the direct image of the sun, and the brightness and spectral gradients). We examined the response to both types of cues using commercially-reared post-larvae of the spine-cheeked anemonefish Premnas biaculeatus. Initial optomotor trials indicated that the post-larval stages are sensitive to linearly polarized light. Swimming directionality was then tested using a Drifting In-Situ Chamber (DISC), which allowed us to examine the response of the post-larvae to natural variation in light conditions and to manipulated levels of light polarization. Under natural light conditions, 28 of 29 post-larvae showed significant directional swimming (Rayleigh's test p<0.05, R = 0.74 +/- 0.23), but to no particular direction. Swimming directionality was positively affected by sky clarity (absence of clouds and haze), which explained 38% of the observed variation. Moreover, post-larvae swimming under fully polarized light exhibited a distinct behavior of tracking the polarization axis, as it rotated along with the DISC. This behavior was not observed under partially-polarized illumination. We view these findings as an indication for the use of sun-related cues, and polarized light signal in specific, by orienting coral-reef fish larvae.","[Berenshtein, Igal; Kiflawi, Moshe; Shashar, Nadav; Wieler, Uri] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Berenshtein, Igal; Kiflawi, Moshe] Interuniv Inst Marine Sci Eilat, Elat, Israel; [Agiv, Haim] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Anim Sci, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Paris, Claire B.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA",15,10.1371/journal.pone.0088468,2014

Many coral reefs are dynamic with respect to carbonate chemistry, and experience fluctuations in pCO(2) that exceed OA projections for the near future. To understand the influence of dynamic pCO(2) on an important reef calcifier, we tested the response of the crustose coralline alga Porolithon onkodes to oscillating pCO(2). Individuals were exposed to ambient (400 mu atm), high (660 mu atm), or variable pCO(2) (oscillating between 400/660 mu atm) treatments for 14 days. To explore the potential for coralline acclimatization, we collected individuals from low and high pCO(2) variability sites (upstream and downstream respectively) on a back reef characterized by unidirectional water flow in Moorea, French Polynesia. We quantified the effects of treatment on algal calcification by measuring the change in buoyant weight, and on algal metabolism by conducting sealed incubations to measure rates of photosynthesis and respiration. Net photosynthesis was higher in the ambient treatment than the variable treatment, regardless of habitat origin, and there was no effect on respiration or gross photosynthesis. Exposure to high pCO(2) decreased P. onkodes calcification by >70%, regardless of the original habitat. In the variable treatment, corallines from the high variability habitat calcified 42% more than corallines from the low variability habitat. The significance of the original habitat for the coralline calcification response to variable, high pCO(2) indicates that individuals existing in dynamic pCO(2) habitats may be acclimatized to OA within the scope of in situ variability. These results highlight the importance of accounting for natural pCO(2) variability in OA manipulations, and provide insight into the potential for plasticity in habitat and species-specific responses to changing ocean chemistry.","[Johnson, Maggie D.; Moriarty, Vincent W.; Carpenter, Robert C.] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, Northridge, CA 91330 USA",38,10.1371/journal.pone.0087678,2014

Fish reached a maximum standard length at about 200 days, and no fish lived longer than 368 days at four reefs separated by kilometers to tens of kilometers. There was no evidence for differences in size at age between sexes. Mortality was very high, and for fish greater than 60 days old, mortality rates ranged from 2.9 to 4.6 % day(-1).

However, the interpretation of patterns of gene flow (connectivity) is often based on a stepping stone model of dispersal that can genetically homogenise even distant populations and blur genetic patterns that may better reflect realised dispersal. One way in which realised long-distance dispersal can be accurately determined is by examination of gene flow of taxa between isolated archipelagos and a mainland where there is no possible stepping stone dispersal across the open ocean. We investigated the genetic structuring of populations of the intertidal gastropod Nerita melanotragus from the subtropical Kermadec Islands and temperate New Zealand's North Island (the mainland), separated by 750 km of open ocean and characterised by contrasting environmental conditions. Analyses of seven microsatellite markers revealed an absence of genetic structuring with low F (ST) and Jost's D values (from 0.000 to 0.007 and from 0.000 to 0.015, respectively) over large geographic distances and no evidence of isolation by distance among all populations.

It hosts significant bird colonies and the world's largest-known deep-sea coral reef. New areas will be opened to petroleum production only if its high environmental value can be maintained.

Many reef fisheries worldwide are open access, and fishers under open access systems are theorized to discount the future at an infinite rate. In contrast, fishers in a customary managed fishery can be expected to be more long term oriented, and thus possibly have lower discount rates. The present study tests this hypothesis by eliciting the discount rates of fishers in an open access small-scale reef fishery, and compares these rates to those of fishers in a customary managed reef fishery. Results indicate that fishers in both open access and traditionally managed reef fisheries have high annual discount rates that are on average over 200%. Contrary to expectations, fishers under an open access system are not associated with higher discount rates compared to customary management. It also appears that a larger proportion of open access fishers are more long-term oriented than those in the customary managed fishery, which is encouraging for the future conservation and sustainability of open access fisheries resources.

When deciding on the location of terrestrial protected areas, planners typically focus only on terrestrial conservation goals, ignoring potential linked benefits to marine ecosystems. These benefits include maintenance of downstream water quality, as forest protection can prevent changes in amount and composition of river runoff that negatively impacts coral reefs. This study aims to determine the benefit of different terrestrial reserve networks to the condition of coral reefs adjacent to the main islands of Fiji to support the work of Fiji's Protected Area Committee in expanding the national protected area estate through integrated land-sea planning. Options for terrestrial protected area networks were designed using six approaches, where the primary objective of each approach was to either achieve terrestrial conservation goals (e.g., represent 40% of each vegetation type) or maximize benefits to coral reefs by minimizing potential for land-based runoff. When achieving terrestrial conservation goals was the primary objective, the potential benefits to coral reef condition were 7.7-10.4% greater than benefits from the existing network of protected areas. When benefiting reefs was the primary objective, benefits to coral reefs were 1.1-2.8 times greater per unit area than networks designed to only achieve terrestrial conservation goals, but 31-44% of the terrestrial conservation goals were not achieved. These results are already being used by Fiji's Protected Area Committee to modify the boundaries of existing priority places to deliver outcomes that better meet terrestrial conservation goals while offering greater benefits to coral reef condition through prevention of run-off.

In particular, behavioural lateralization, an expression of brain functional asymmetries, is affected by elevated CO2 in both coral reef and temperate fishes. However, the potentially interacting effects of rising temperatures and CO2 on lateralization are unknown. Here, we tested the combined effect of near-future elevated-CO2 concentrations (930 mu atm) and temperature variation on behavioural lateralization of a marine damselfish, Pomacentrus wardi. Individuals exposed to one of four treatments (two CO2 levels and two temperatures) were observed in a detour test where they made repeated decisions about turning left or right. Individuals exposed to current CO2 and ambient temperature levels showed a significant right-turning bias at the population level. This biased was reversed (i.e. to the left side) in fish exposed to the elevated-CO2 treatment. Increased temperature attenuated this effect, resulting in lower values of relative lateralization. Consequently, rising temperature and elevated CO2 may have different and interactive effects on behavioural lateralization and therefore future studies on the effect of climate change on brain functions need to consider both these critical variables in order to assess the potential consequences for the ecological interactions of marine fishes.","[Domenici, Paolo] CNR, IAMC, Torregrande, Oristano, Italy; [Allan, Bridie J.

The common sole (Solea solea), an important commercial flatfish in the North Sea, Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, has a marine pelagic larval stage, a benthic juvenile stage in coastal nurseries (lagoons, estuaries or shallow marine areas) and a benthic adult stage in deeper marine waters on the continental shelf. To date, the ecological connectivity among these life stages has been little assessed in the Mediterranean. Here, such an assessment is provided for the first time for the Gulf of Lions, NW Mediterranean, based on a dataset on otolith microchemistry and stable isotopic composition as indicators of the water masses inhabited by individual fish. Specifically, otolith Ba/Ca and Sr/Ca profiles, and delta C-13 and delta O-18 values of adults collected in four areas of the Gulf of Lions were compared with those of young-of-the-year collected in different coastal nurseries. Results showed that a high proportion of adults (>46%) were influenced by river inputs during their larval stage. Furthermore Sr/Ca ratios and the otolith length at one year of age revealed that most adults (similar to 70%) spent their juvenile stage in nurseries with high salinity, whereas the remainder used brackish environments. In total, data were consistent with the use of six nursery types, three with high salinity (marine areas and two types of highly saline lagoons) and three brackish (coastal areas near river mouths, and two types of brackish environments), all of which contributed to the replenishment of adult populations. These finding implicated panmixia in sole population in the Gulf of Lions and claimed for a habitat integrated management of fisheries.","[Morat, Fabien; Harmelin-Vivien, Mireille] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS INSU, Mediterranean Inst Oceanog MIO UM 110, IRD, Marseille, France; [Morat, Fabien; Harmelin-Vivien, Mireille] Univ Toulon & Var, CNRS INSU, Mediterranean Inst Oceanog MIO UM 110, IRD, La Garde, France; [Letourneur, Yves] Univ Nouvelle Caledonie, Lab LIVE & LABEX Corail, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Dierking, Jan] Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res GEOMAR, Kiel, Germany; [Pecheyran, Christophe; Bareille, Gilles] Univ Pau & Pays Adour, LCABIE, UMR CNRS IPREM 5254, Pau, France; [Blamart, Dominique] UMR 8212 CEA CNRS UVSQ, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, Gif Sur Yvette, France",10,10.1371/journal.pone.0086585,2014

Sponges are an important component of coral reef fauna that perform many important functional roles and changes in their abundance and diversity as a result of environmental change has the potential to affect overall reef ecosystem functioning. In this study, we examined patterns of sponge biodiversity and abundance across a range of environments to assess the potential key drivers of differences in benthic community structure. We found that sponge assemblages were significantly different across the study sites, but were dominated by one species Lamellodysidea herbacea (42% of all sponges patches recorded) and that the differential rate of sediment deposition was the most important variable driving differences in abundance patterns. Lamellodysidea herbacea abundance was positively associated with sedimentation rates, while total sponge abundance excluding Lamellodysidea herbacea was negatively associated with rates of sedimentation. Overall variation in sponge assemblage composition was correlated with a number of variables although each variable explained only a small amount of the overall variation. Although sponge abundance remained similar across environments, diversity was negatively affected by sedimentation, with the most sedimented sites being dominated by a single sponge species. Our study shows how some sponge species are able to tolerate high levels of sediment and that any transition of coral reefs to more sedimented states may result in a shift to a low diversity sponge dominated system, which is likely to have subsequent effects on ecosystem functioning.","[Powell, Abigail; Jones, Timothy; Berman, Jade; Bell, James J.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington, New Zealand; [Smith, David J.; Hepburn, Leanne J.] Univ Essex, Coral Reef Res Unit, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Jompa, Jamaluddin] Hasanuddin Univ, Res & Dev Ctr Marine Coastal & Small Isl, Makassar, Indonesia",19,10.1371/journal.pone.0085253,2014

Here, I examine variation in timing of sex change for exploited parrotfishes across a range of environmental, anthropogenic and geographical factors. Results were highly dependent on spatial scale. Fishing pressure was the most influential factor determining length at sex change at the within-island scale where a wide range of anthropogenic pressure existed. Sex transition occurred at smaller sizes where fishing pressure was high. Among islands, however, differences were overwhelmingly predicted by reefal-scale structural features, a pattern evident for all species examined. For the most abundant species, Chlorurus spilurus, length at sex change increased at higher overall densities and greater female-to-male sex ratios at all islands except where targeted by fishermen; here the trend was reversed. This implies differing selective pressures on adult individuals can significantly alter sex change dynamics, highlighting the importance of social structure, demography and the selective forces structuring populations. Considerable life-history responses to exploitation were observed, but results suggest potential fishing effects on demography may be obscured by natural variation at biogeographic scales.","[Taylor, Brett M.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Taylor, Brett M.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",16,10.1098/rspb.2013.2423,2014

These patterns emerge from analysis of imagery and specimen collections taken from a suite of surveys using photographic and in situ sampling by epibenthic sleds, towed video cameras, an autonomous underwater vehicle and a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). Seamount peaks in shallow zones had relatively low biomass and low diversity assemblages, which may be in part natural and in part due to effects of bottom trawl fishing. Species richness was highest at intermediate depths (1000-1300 m) as a result of an extensive coral reef community based on the bioherm-forming scleractinian Solenosmilia variabilis. However, megabenthos abundance peaked in a deeper, low diversity assemblage at 2000-2500 m. The S. variabilis reef and the deep biomass zone were separated by an extensive dead, sub-fossil S. variabilis reef and a relatively low biomass stratum on volcanic rock roughly coincident with the oxygen minimum layer. Below 2400 m, megabenthos was increasingly sparse, though punctuated by occasional small pockets of relatively high diversity and biomass. Nonetheless, megabenthic organisms were observed in the vast majority of photographs on all seabed habitats and to the maximum depths observed - a sandy plain below 3950 m. Taxonomic studies in progress suggest that the observed depth zonation is based in part on changing species mixes with depth, but also an underlying commonality to much of the seamount and rocky substrate biota across all depths. Although the mechanisms supporting the extraordinarily high biomass in 2000-2500 m depths remains obscure, plausible explanations include equatorwards lateral transport of polar production and/or a response to depth-stratified oxygen availability.","[Thresher, Ronald; Althaus, Franziska; Gowlett-Holmes, Karen; Alderslade, Phil; Dowdney, Jo; McEnnulty, Felicity; Williams, Alan] CSIRO Wealth Oceans Flagship, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Adkins, Jess; Gagnon, Alex] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Cho, Walter] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Staples, David] Museum Victoria, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",17,10.1371/journal.pone.0085872,2014

We investigated in situ the consequences of long-term exposure to high CO2 on coral-reef-associated macroinvertebrate communities around three shallow volcanic CO2 seeps in Papua New Guinea. The densities of many groups and the number of taxa (classes and phyla) of macroinvertebrates were significantly reduced at elevated CO2 (425-1100 mu atm) compared with control sites. However, sensitivities of some groups, including decapod crustaceans, ascidians and several echinoderms, contrasted with predictions of their physiological CO2 tolerances derived from laboratory experiments. High CO2 reduced the availability of structurally complex corals that are essential refugia for many reef-associated macroinvertebrates. This loss of habitat complexity was also associated with losses in many macroinvertebrate groups, especially predation-prone mobile taxa, including crustaceans and crinoids. The transition from living to dead coral as substratum and habitat further altered macroinvertebrate communities, with far more taxa losing than gaining in numbers. Our study shows that indirect ecological effects of OA (reduced habitat complexity) will complement its direct physiological effects and together with the loss of coral cover through climate change will severely affect macroinvertebrate communities in coral reefs.","[Fabricius, K.

Identifying and quantifying fish aggregations (particularly during spawning events) are often top priorities for coastal managers. However, the rapid mapping of these aggregations using conventional survey methods (e. g., non-technical SCUBA diving and remotely operated cameras) are limited by depth, visibility and time. Acoustic sensors (i.e., splitbeam and multibeam echosounders) are not constrained by these same limitations, and were used to concurrently map and quantify the location, density and size of reef fish along with seafloor structure in two, separate locations in the U. S. Virgin Islands. Reef fish aggregations were documented along the shelf edge, an ecologically important ecotone in the region. Fish were grouped into three classes according to body size, and relationships with the benthic seascape were modeled in one area using Boosted Regression Trees. These models were validated in a second area to test their predictive performance in locations where fish have not been mapped. Models predicting the density of large fish (>= 29 cm) performed well (i.e., AUC = 0.77). Water depth and standard deviation of depth were the most influential predictors at two spatial scales (100 and 300 m). Models of small (<= 11 cm) and medium (12-28 cm) fish performed poorly (i.e., AUC = 0.49 to 0.68) due to the high prevalence (45-79%) of smaller fish in both locations, and the unequal prevalence of smaller fish in the training and validation areas. Integrating acoustic sensors with spatial modeling offers a new and reliable approach to rapidly identify fish aggregations and to predict the density large fish in un-surveyed locations. This integrative approach will help coastal managers to prioritize sites, and focus their limited resources on areas that may be of higher conservation value.","[Costa, Bryan; Kracker, Laura; Battista, Tim; Pittman, Simon] NOAA, Biogeog Branch, Natl Ctr Coastal Ocean Sci, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA; [Costa, Bryan] Consolidated Safety Serv, Fairfax, VA USA; [Taylor, J.

Logistic challenges prevent broad-scale species-level monitoring of hard corals; hence it has become critical that effective proxy indicators of species richness are established. This study tests how accurately three potential proxy indicators (generic richness on belt transects, generic richness on point-intercept transects and percent live hard coral cover on point-intercept transects) predict coral species richness at three different locations and two analytical scales. Generic richness (measured on a belt transect) was found to be the most effective predictor variable, with significant positive linear relationships across locations and scales. Percent live hard coral cover consistently performed poorly as an indicator of coral species richness. This study advances the practical framework for optimizing coral reef monitoring programs and empirically demonstrates that generic richness offers an effective way to predict coral species richness with a moderate level of precision. While the accuracy of species richness estimates will decrease in communities dominated by species-rich genera (e.g. Acropora), generic richness provides a useful measure of phylogenetic diversity and incorporating this metric into monitoring programs will increase the likelihood that changes in coral species diversity can be detected.","[Richards, Zoe T.] Western Australian Museum, Dept Aquat Zool, Welshpool, WA, Australia; [Hobbs, Jean-Paul A.] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Hobbs, Jean-Paul A.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, Crawley, WA, Australia",7,10.1371/journal.pone.0083965,2014

We investigated the potential of using the characteristic fluorescence emission spectra of these pigments to enable unsupervised, optical classification of coral reef habitats. We compiled a library of characteristic fluorescence spectra through in situ and laboratory measurements from a variety of specimens throughout the Caribbean. Because fluorescent pigments are not species-specific, the spectral library is organized in terms of 15 functional groups. We investigated the spectral separability of the functional groups in terms of the number of wavebands required to distinguish between them, using the similarity measures Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), Spectral Information Divergence (SID), SID-SAM mixed measure, and Mahalanobis distance. This set of measures represents geometric, stochastic, joint geometric-stochastic, and statistical approaches to classifying spectra. Our hyperspectral fluorescence data were used to generate sets of 4-, 6-, and 8-waveband spectra, including random variations in relative signal amplitude, spectral peak shifts, and water-column attenuation. Each set consisted of 2 different band definitions: 'optimally-picked' and 'evenly-spaced.' The optimally-picked wavebands were chosen to coincide with as many peaks as possible in the functional group spectra. Reference libraries were formed from half of the spectra in each set and used for training purposes. Average classification accuracies ranged from 76.3% for SAM with 4 evenly-spaced wavebands to 93.8% for Mahalanobis distance with 8 evenly-spaced wavebands. The Mahalanobis distance consistently outperformed the other measures. In a second test, empirically-measured spectra were classified using the same reference libraries and the Mahalanobis distance for just the 8 evenly-spaced waveband case. Average classification accuracies were 84% and 87%, corresponding to the extremes in modeled water-column attenuation. The classification results from both tests indicate that a high degree of separability among the 15 fluorescent-spectra functional groups is possible using only a modest number of spectral bands.","[Zawada, David G.] US Geol Survey, St Petersburg Coastal & Marine Sci Ctr, St Petersburg, FL USA; [Mazel, Charles H.] Phys Sci Inc, Andover, MA 01810 USA",10,10.1371/journal.pone.0084570,2014

This study utilises a simple and inexpensive instrument (<$150) to provide a detailed current velocity profile of the coral-reef system around Lizard Island (Great Barrier Reef, Australia) at a spatial and temporal scale relevant to the ecology of individual benthos and fish. The instrument uses load-cell sensors to provide a correlation between sensor output and ambient current velocity of 99%. Each instrument is able to continuously record current velocities to >500 cms(-1) and wave frequency to >100 Hz over several weeks. Sensor data are registered and processed at 16 MHz and 10 bit resolution, with a measuring precision of 0.06+/-0.04%, and accuracy of 0.51+/-0.65% (mean +/-S.D.). Each instrument is also pressure rated to 120 m and shear stresses <= 20 kNm(-2) allowing deployment in harsh environments. The instrument was deployed across 27 coral reef sites covering the crest (3 m), mid-slope (6 m) and deep-slope (9 m depth) of habitats directly exposed, oblique or sheltered from prevailing winds. Measurements demonstrate that currents over the reef slope and crest varies immensely depending on depth and exposure: Currents differ up to 9-fold within habitats only separated by 3 m depth and 15-fold between exposed, oblique and sheltered habitats. Comparisons to ambient weather conditions reveal that currents around Lizard Island are largely wind driven. Zero to 22.5 knot winds correspond directly to currents of 0 to >82 cms(-1), while tidal currents rarely exceed 5.5 cms(-1). Rather, current velocity increases exponentially as a function of wave height (0 to 1.6 m) and frequency (0.54 to 0.20 Hz), emphasizing the enormous effect of wind and waves on organisms in these shallow coral reef habitats.","[Johansen, Jacob L.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Johansen, Jacob L.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",8,10.1371/journal.pone.0083240,2014

Fish biofluorescence is especially common and morphologically variable in cryptically patterned coral-reef lineages.

The presence of yellow long-pass intraocular filters in many biofluorescent fish lineages and the substantive color vision capabilities of coral-reef fishes suggest that they are capable of detecting fluoresced light. We present species-specific emission patterns among closely related species, indicating that biofluorescence potentially functions in intraspecific communication and evidence that fluorescence can be used for camouflage.

Using a large-scale synthesis of peer-reviewed and unpublished data, we examine variability in abundance and biomass of herbivorous reef fishes and explore evidence for fishing impacts globally and within regions. We show that biomass is more than twice as high in locations not accessible to fisheries relative to fisheries-accessible locations. Although there are large biogeographic differences in total biomass, the effects of fishing are consistent in nearly all regions. We also show that exposure to fishing alters the structure of the herbivore community by disproportionately reducing biomass of large-bodied functional groups (scraper/excavators, browsers, grazer/detritivores), while increasing biomass and abundance of territorial algal-farming damselfishes (Pomacentridae). The browser functional group that consumes macroalgae and can help to prevent coral-macroalgal phase shifts appears to be most susceptible to fishing. This fishing down the herbivore guild probably alters the effectiveness of these fishes in regulating algal abundance on reefs.

Here, we show that projected near-future seawater CO2 levels (961 mu atm) impair this escape behaviour during a predator-prey interaction. Elevated-CO2 halved the number of snails that jumped from the predator, increased their latency to jump and altered their escape trajectory.

An extreme ocean warming event in 2010 placed Tobago's coral reefs under severe stress resulting in widespread coral bleaching and threatening the livelihoods that rely on them. The bleaching response of four reef building taxa was monitored over a six month period across three major reefs systems in Tobago. By identifying taxa resilient to bleaching we propose to assist local coral reef managers in the decision making process to cope with mass bleaching events. The bleaching signal (length of exposure to high ocean temperatures) varied widely between the Atlantic and Caribbean reefs, but regardless of this variation most taxa bleached. Colpophyllia natans, Montastraea faveolata and Siderastrea siderea were considered the most bleaching vulnerable taxa. Interestingly, reefs with the highest coral cover showed the greatest decline reef building taxa, and conversely, reefs with the lowest coral cover showed the most bleaching but lowest change in coral cover with little algal overgrowth post-bleaching.","[Alemu, Jahson Berhane, I; Clement, Ysharda] Inst Marine Affairs, Biodivers & Ecol Res Programme, Chaguaramas, Trinid & Tobago; [Alemu, Jahson Berhane, I] Univ W Indies, Dept Life Sci, St Augustine, Trinid & Tobago",6,10.1371/journal.pone.0083829,2014

When designing a sampling protocol, one crucial step is the choice of the most suitable sampling technique which is a compromise between the questions addressed, the available means and the precision required. The objective of this study is to compare the ability to sample reef fish communities at the same locations using two techniques based on the same stationary point count method: one using Underwater Visual Census (UVC) and the other rotating video (STAVIRO). UVC and STAVIRO observations were carried out on the exact same 26 points on the reef slope of an intermediate reef and the associated inner barrier reefs. STAVIRO systems were always deployed 30 min to 1 hour after UVC and set exactly at the same place. Our study shows that; (i) fish community observations by UVC and STAVIRO differed significantly; (ii) species richness and density of large species were not significantly different between techniques; (iii) species richness and density of small species were higher for UVC; (iv) density of fished species was higher for STAVIRO and (v) only UVC detected significant differences in fish assemblage structure across reef type at the spatial scale studied. We recommend that the two techniques should be used in a complementary way to survey a large area within a short period of time. UVC may census reef fish within complex habitats or in very shallow areas such as reef flat whereas STAVIRO would enable carrying out a large number of stations focused on large and diver-averse species, particularly in the areas not covered by UVC due to time and depth constraints. This methodology would considerably increase the spatial coverage and replication level of fish monitoring surveys.","[Mallet, Delphine; Pelletier, Dominique] IFREMER, Unite Rech Lagons Ecosyst & Aquaculture Durable N, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Mallet, Delphine; Wantiez, Laurent; Lemouellic, Soazig] Univ Nouvelle Caledonie, EA LIVE 4243, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Vigliola, Laurent] IRD, UMR CoReUS 227, Lab Excellence LABEX Corail, Noumea, New Caledonia",12,10.1371/journal.pone.0084344,2014

In this study, stable isotope analyses were used to infer trophic ecology of a guild of large predatory fishes that are targeted by fisheries on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Each of four focal predators (Plectropomus leopardus, Plectropomus maculatus, Lethrinus miniatus and Lutjanus carponotatus) was found to have a distinct isotopic signature in terms of delta C-13 and delta N-15. A two-source mixing model (benthic reef-based versus pelagic) indicated that P. leopardus and L. miniatus derive the majority (72 and 62 %, respectively) of their production from planktonic sources, while P. maculatus and L. carponotatus derive the majority (89 and 74 %, respectively) of their production from benthic reef-based sources. This indicates that planktonic production is important for sustaining key species in reef fisheries and highlights the need for a whole-ecosystem approach to fisheries management. Unexpectedly, there was little isotopic niche overlap between three of four focal predators, suggesting that inter-specific competition for prey may be low or absent. delta(15)Nitrogen indicated that the closely related P. leopardus and P. maculatus are apex predators (trophic level > 4), while delta C-13 indicated that each species has a different diet and degree of trophic specialisation. In view of these divergent trophic ecologies, each of the four focal predators (and the associated fisheries) are anticipated to be differentially affected by climate-induced disturbances. Thus, the results presented herein provide a useful starting point for precautionary management of exploited predator populations in a changing climate.","[Frisch, Ashley J.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Ireland, Matthew; Baker, Ronald] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Baker, Ronald] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org CSIRO Land & Water, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",30,10.1007/s00227-013-2315-4,2014

Analyses of the science needed to manage human uses of ecosystem services have concentrated on terrestrial ecosystems. Our focus is on the provision of multidisciplinary data needed to inform adaptive, ecosystem-based approaches (EBAs) for maintaining coastal ecosystem services based on comparative ecosystem analyses. Key indicators of pressures on coastal ecosystems, ecosystem states and the impacts of changes in states on services are identified for monitoring and analysis at a global coastal network of sentinel sites nested in the ocean-climate observing system. Biodiversity is targeted as the ""master"" indicator because of its importance to a broad spectrum of services. Ultimately, successful implementation of EBAs will depend on establishing integrated, holistic approaches to ocean governance that oversee the development of integrated, operational ocean observing systems based on the data and information requirements specified by a broad spectrum of stakeholders for sustainable development. Sustained engagement of such a spectrum of stakeholders on a global scale is not feasible. The global coastal network will need to be customized locally and regionally based on priorities established by stakeholders in their respective regions. The E.U. Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the U.S. Recommendations of the Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force are important examples of emerging regional scale approaches.

Few studies have quantified recovery of temperate rocky reef communities following the cessation of scallop dredging or demersal trawling. This is critical information for the future management of these habitats to contribute towards conservation and fisheries targets. The Lyme Bay MPA, in south west UK, has excluded towed demersal fishing gear from 206 km(2) of sensitive reef habitat using a Statutory Instrument since July 2008. To assess benthic recovery in this MPA we used a flying video array to survey macro epi-benthos annually from 2008 to 2011. 4 treatments (the New Closure, previously voluntarily Closed Controls and Near or Far Open to fishing Controls) were sampled to test a recovery hypothesis that was defined as 'the New Closure becoming more similar to the Closed Controls and less similar to the Open Controls'. Following the cessation of towed demersal fishing, within three years positive responses were observed for species richness, total abundance, assemblage composition and seven of 13 indicator taxa. Definitive evidence of recovery was noted for species richness and three of the indicator taxa (Pentapora fascialis, Phallusia mammillata and Pecten maximus). While it is hoped that MPAs, which exclude anthropogenic disturbance, will allow functional restoration of goods and services provided by benthic communities, it is an unknown for temperate reef systems. Establishing the likely timescales for restoration is key to future marine management. We demonstrate the early stages of successful recruitment and link these to the potential wider ecosystem benefits including those to commercial fisheries.","[Sheehan, Emma V.; Gall, Sarah C.; Cousens, Sophie L.; Attrill, Martin J.] Univ Plymouth, Inst Marine, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Stevens, Timothy F.] Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Gold Coast, NSW, Australia; [Stevens, Timothy F.] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst Coasts & Estuaries, Gold Coast, NSW, Australia",20,10.1371/journal.pone.0083883,2013

Here, we used pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes to compare the bacterial and archaeal communities associated with two individuals of the marine sponge Inflatella pellicula from the deep-sea, sampled from a depth of 2,900 m, a depth which far exceeds any previous sequence-based report of sponge-associated microbial communities. Sponge-microbial communities were also compared to the microbial community in the surrounding seawater. Sponge-associated microbial communities were dominated by archaeal sequencing reads with a single archaeal OTU, comprising similar to 60% and similar to 72% of sequences, being observed from Inflatella pellicula. Archaeal sequencing reads were less abundant in seawater (similar to 11% of sequences). Sponge-associated microbial communities were less diverse and less even than any other sponge-microbial community investigated to date with just 210 and 273 OTUs (97% sequence identity) identified in sponges, with 4 and 6 dominant OTUs comprising similar to 88% and similar to 89% of sequences, respectively. Members of the candidate phyla, SAR406, NC10 and ZB3 are reported here from sponges for the first time, increasing the number of bacterial phyla or candidate divisions associated with sponges to 43. A minor cohort from both sponge samples (similar to 0.2% and similar to 0.3% of sequences) were not classified to phylum level.

Behavioral syndromes have potentially important ecological consequences (e.g. survivorship tradeoffs) and can be shaped by population dynamics through selective mortality. Here, we search for any evidence for consistency of behavior across situations in juveniles of a common damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis (Pomacentridae) at the transition between larval habitats in the plankton and juvenile habitats on the reef. Naive fish leaving the pelagic phase to settle on reefs were caught by light traps and their behaviors observed using similar methods across three different situations (small aquaria, large aquaria, field setting); all of which represent low risk and well-sheltered environments. Seven behavioral traits were compared within and among individuals across situations to determine if consistent behavioral syndromes existed. No consistency was found in any single or combination of behavioral traits for individuals across all situations. We suggest that high behavioral flexibility is likely beneficial for newly-settled fish at this ontogenetic transition and it is possible that consistent behavioral syndromes are unlikely to emerge in juveniles until environmental experience is gained or certain combinations of behaviors are favored by selective mortality.","[White, James R.; McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Meekan, Mark G.] Univ Western Australia, Australian Inst Marine Sci, Crawley, WA, Australia",7,10.1371/journal.pone.0084262,2013

Numerous studies have quantified how home ranges scale with body size across taxa. However, these relationships are not always applicable intraspecifically. Here, we describe how the home range of an important group of reef fish, the parrotfishes, scales with body mass. With masses spanning five orders of magnitude, from the early postsettlement stage through to adulthood, we find no evidence of a response to predation risk, dietary shifts or sex change on home range expansion rates. Instead, we document a distinct ontogenetic shift in home range expansion with sexual maturity. Juvenile parrotfishes displayed rapid home range growth until reaching approximately 100-150 mm length. Thereafter, the relationship between home range and mass broke down. This shift reflected changes in colour patterns, social status and reproductive behaviour associated with the transition to adult stages. While there is a clear relationship between body mass and home ranges among adult individuals of different species, it does not appear to be applicable to size changes within species. Ontogenetic changes in parrotfishes do not follow expected mass-area scaling relationships.","[Welsh, J. Q.; Goatley, C. H. R.; Bellwood, D.

However, benthic P budgets of specific ecosystem compartments such as macrophyte-dominated reef lagoons are still scarce. To address this, we quantified individual and lagoon-wide net (P-n) and gross (P-g) primary production by all dominant functional groups of benthic primary producers in a typical macrophyte-dominated Caribbean reef lagoon near Puerto Morelos (Mexico) via measurement of O-2 fluxes in incubation experiments. The photosynthetically active 3D lagoon surface area was quantified using conversion factors to allow extrapolation to lagoon-wide P budgets. Findings revealed that lagoon 2D benthic cover was primarily composed of sand-associated microphytobenthos (40%), seagrasses (29%) and macroalgae (27%), while seagrasses dominated the lagoon 3D surface area (84%). Individual Pg was highest for macroalgae and scleractinian corals (87 and 86 mmol O-2 m(-2) specimen area d(-1), respectively), however seagrasses contributed highest (59%) to the lagoon-wide P-g. Macroalgae exhibited highest individual P-n rates, but seagrasses generated the largest fraction (51%) of lagoon-wide P-n. Individual R was highest for scleractinian corals and macroalgae, whereas seagrasses again provided the major lagoon-wide share (68%). These findings characterise the investigated lagoon as a net autotrophic coral reef ecosystem compartment revealing similar P compared to other macrophyte-dominated coastal environments such as seagrass meadows and macroalgae beds. Further, high lagoon-wide P (Pg: 488 and P-n: 181 mmol O-2 m(-2) lagoon area d(-1)) and overall P-g:R (1.6) indicate substantial benthic excess production within the Puerto Morelos reef lagoon and suggest the export of newly synthesised organic matter to surrounding ecosystems.","[Naumann, Malik S.; Jantzen, Carin; Haas, Andreas F.; Wild, Christian] Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Ecol ZMT, Coral Reef Ecol Grp CORE, Bremen, Germany; [Iglesias-Prieto, Roberto] UNAM, Unidad Acad Puerto Morelos, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Cancun, Quintana Roo, Mexico; [Wild, Christian] Univ Bremen, Fac Biol & Chem, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",14,10.1371/journal.pone.0082923,2013

Given the typical scarcity of algae in coral reefs, this behavior seems maladaptive. Here we suggest that the fishes' slow feeding during the morning is an outcome of highly selective feeding on scarcely found green algae. The rarity of the food requires longer search time and extended swimming tracks, resulting in lower bite rates. According to our findings by noon the fish seem to stop their search and switch to indiscriminative consumption of benthic algae, resulting in apparent higher feeding rates. The abundance of the rare preferable algae gradually declines from morning to noon and seems to reach its lowest levels around the switch time. Using in situ experiments we found that the feeding pattern is flexible, with the fish exhibiting fast feeding rates when presented with ample supply of preferable algae, regardless of the time of day. Analyses of the fish's esophagus content corroborated our conclusion that their feeding was highly selective in the morning and non-selective in the afternoon. Modeling of the fishes' behavior predicted that the fish should perform a diel diet shift when the preferred food is relatively rare, a situation common in most coral reefs found in a warm, oligotrophic ocean.","[Khait, Ruth; Genin, Amatzia] Interuniv Inst Marine Sci Eilat, Elat, Israel; [Khait, Ruth; Genin, Amatzia] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, Jerusalem, Israel; [Obolski, Uri; Hadany, Lilach] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Ecol Plants, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",4,10.1371/journal.pone.0082391,2013

However, the particular features of the habitat that are most critical are not always known. Coral habitats can vary in many characteristics, notably live coral cover, topographic complexity and coral diversity, but the relative effects of these habitat characteristics are often not distinguished. Here, we investigate the strength of the relationships between these habitat features and local fish diversity, abundance and community structure in the lagoon of Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef. In a spatial comparison using sixty-six 2m(2) quadrats, fish species richness, total abundance and community structure were examined in relation to a wide range of habitat variables, including topographic complexity, habitat diversity, coral diversity, coral species richness, hard coral cover, branching coral cover and the cover of corymbose corals. Fish species richness and total abundance were strongly associated with coral species richness and cover, but only weakly associated with topographic complexity. Regression tree analysis showed that coral species richness accounted for most of the variation in fish species richness (63.6%), while hard coral cover explained more variation in total fish abundance (17.4%), than any other variable. In contrast, topographic complexity accounted for little spatial variation in reef fish assemblages. In degrading coral reef environments, the potential effects of loss of coral cover and topographic complexity are often emphasized, but these findings suggest that reduced coral biodiversity may ultimately have an equal, or greater, impact on reef-associated fish communities.","[Komyakova, Valeriya] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",38,10.1371/journal.pone.0083178,2013

Climate change will alter the physico-chemical environment that reefs currently occupy, leaving only limited regions that are conducive to reef habitation. Identifying these regions early may aid conservation efforts and inform decisions to transplant particular coral species or groups. Here a species distribution model (Maxent) is used to describe habitat suitable for coral reef growth. Two climate change scenarios (RCP4.5, RCP8.5) from the National Center for Atmospheric Research's Community Earth System Model were used with Maxent to determine environmental suitability for corals (order Scleractinia). Environmental input variables best at representing the limits of suitable reef growth regions were isolated using a principal component analysis. Climate-driven changes in suitable habitat depend strongly on the unique region of reefs used to train Maxent. Increased global habitat loss was predicted in both climate projections through the 21st century. A maximum habitat loss of 43% by 2100 was predicted in RCP4.5 and 82% in RCP8.5. When the model is trained solely with environmental data from the Caribbean/Atlantic, 83% of global habitat was lost by 2100 for RCP4.5 and 88% was lost for RCP8.5. Similarly, global runs trained only with Pacific Ocean reefs estimated that 60% of suitable habitat would be lost by 2100 in RCP4.5 and 90% in RCP8.5. When Maxent was trained solely with Indian Ocean reefs, suitable habitat worldwide increased by 38% in RCP4.5 by 2100 and 28% in RCP8.5 by 2050. Global habitat loss by 2100 was just 10% for RCP8.5. This projection suggests that shallow tropical sites in the Indian Ocean basin experience conditions today that are most similar to future projections of worldwide conditions. Indian Ocean reefs may thus be ideal candidate regions from which to select the best strands of coral for potential re-seeding efforts.","[Freeman, Lauren A.; Miller, Arthur J.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Kleypas, Joan A.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",14,10.1371/journal.pone.0082404,2013

We can expect that such range shifts are likely to be limited by species-specific resource requirements, with temperate rocky reefs potentially lacking a range of settlement substrates or specific dietary components important in structuring the settlement and success of tropical and subtropical fish species. We examined the importance of resource use in structuring the distribution patterns of range shifting tropical and subtropical fishes, comparing this with resident temperate fish species within western Japan (Tosa Bay); the abundance, diversity, size class, functional structure and latitudinal range of reef fishes utilizing both coral reef and adjacent rocky reef habitat were quantified over a 2 year period (2008-2010). This region has undergone rapid poleward expansion of reef-building corals in response to increasing coastal water temperatures, and forms one of the global hotspots for rapid coastal changes. Despite the temperate latitude surveyed (33 degrees N, 133 degrees E) the fish assemblage was both numerically, and in terms of richness, dominated by tropical fishes. Such tropical faunal dominance was apparent within both coral, and rocky reef habitats. The size structure of the assemblage suggested that a relatively large number of tropical species are overwintering within both coral and rocky habitats, with a subset of these species being potentially reproductively active. The relatively high abundance and richness of tropical species with obligate associations with live coral resources (i.e., obligate corallivores) shows that this region holds the most well developed temperate-located tropical fish fauna globally. We argue that future tropicalisation of the fish fauna in western Japan, associated with increasing coral habitat development and reported increasing shifts in coastal water temperatures, may have considerable positive economic impacts to the local tourism industry and bring qualitative changes to both local and regional fisheries resources.","[Nakamura, Yohei; Kanda, Masaru; Yamaoka, Kosaku] Kochi Univ, Grad Sch Kuroshio Sci, Nankoku, Kochi, Japan; [Feary, David A.] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Environm, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Kanda, Masaru] Kuroshio Zikkan Ctr, Kochi, Japan",20,10.1371/journal.pone.0081107,2013

Bacterial biodiversity was analyzed by sequencing the 16S rRNA of bacterial cultures and clones. DAPI and FISH methods were used to determine and compare the number of bacteria found in the various gut compartments. A total of 116 phylotypes belonging to the gamma-Proteobacteria (60.5 %), alpha-Proteobacteria (24.5 %), Bacteroidetes (6 %), Actinobacteria (2.75 %), Fusobacteria (1.75 %), Firmicutes (1.75 %), Cyanobacteria (1.75 %) and delta-Proteobacteria (1 %) were identified. The number of bacteria is significantly greater (1.5x) in the foregut than in the ambient sediments. The number of bacteria significantly decreases in the midgut and remains stable until defecation. Some gamma-Proteobacteria, especially Vibrio, are less affected by digestion than other bacterial taxa. The season has an impact on the bacterial diversity found in the sediments transiting through the gut: in the dry season, gamma-Proteobacteria are the most abundant taxon, while alpha-Proteobacteria dominate in the rainy season. Vibrio is the most frequent genus with some well-known opportunistic pathogens like V. harveyi, V. alginolyticus and V. proteolyticus. Findings show that sediment-associated microbial communities are significantly modified by H. scabra during their transit through the gut which supports the view that holothurians play a substantial role in the structuring of bacterial communities at the sediment-seawater interface.","[Plotieau, Thomas; Eeckhaut, Igor] Univ Mons, Biol Marine Organisms & Biomimetism Lab, B-7000 Mons, Belgium; [Plotieau, Thomas] Haute Ecole Provin Hainaut, B-7000 Mons, Belgium; [Lavitra, Thierry; Eeckhaut, Igor] Univ Toliara, IHSM, Polyaquaculture Res Unit, Toliara 601, Madagascar; [Gillan, David C.] Univ Mons, Prote & Microbiol Lab, B-7000 Mons, Belgium",6,10.1007/s00227-013-2297-2,2013

Notably, the richness and diversity of sessile taxa was significantly higher in 2008-2011. Furthermore, the multivariate community structure of sessile and mobile taxa differed between the historic and modern eras. Historic communities were characterized by a high percent cover of bare rock and non-calcified algal crusts, consistent with the effects of grazing by chitons and urchins. The rate of sessile community turnover, an index less susceptible to spatial sampling artifacts than richness or diversity, was not significantly different between the two eras. Together with the naturally high spatial variability in these epilithic communities, and the limited replication of historic quadrats, we interpret cautiously the data as evidence of limited change despite a clear shift in temperature and predator (fish) guild composition. The lack of substantial change in rock wall communities may be due in part to their vertical topography, which limits physical disturbance and the preemption of space by weedy algae, two processes that are often associated with ""phase-shifts"" in other marine ecosystems.","[Elahi, Robin; Sebens, Kenneth P.; Turner, Kevin R.; Dwyer, Timothy R.] Univ Washington, Friday Harbor Labs, Friday Harbor, WA 98250 USA; [Elahi, Robin; Turner, Kevin R.; Dwyer, Timothy R.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Friday Harbor, WA 98250 USA; [Birkeland, Charles] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Biol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Sebens, Kenneth P.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fisheries Sci, Friday Harbor, WA 98250 USA",7,10.1007/s00227-013-2308-3,2013

However, ocean acidification from rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations is predicted to adversely affect many marine animals, while seaweed communities may benefit and prosper. We tested how exposure to different pCO(2) (400, 1,800 and 4,000 mu atm) may affect grazing on the green alga Ulva lactuca by herbivorous fish and sea urchins from the coral reefs in the northern Gulf of Aqaba (Red Sea), either directly, by changing herbivore behaviour, or indirectly via changes in algal palatability. We also determined the effects of pCO(2) on algal tissue concentrations of protein and the grazing-deterrent secondary metabolite dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). Grazing preferences and overall consumption were tested in a series of multiple-choice feeding experiments in the laboratory and in situ following exposure for 14 d (algae) and 28 d (herbivores). 4,000 mu atm had a significant effect on the biochemical composition and palatability of U. lactuca. No effects were observed at 1,800 relative to 400 mu atm (control). Exposure of U. lactuca to 4,000 mu atm resulted in a significant decrease in protein and increase in DMSP concentration. This coincided with a reduced preference for these algae by the sea urchin Tripneustes gratilla and different herbivorous fish species in situ (Acanthuridae, Siganidae and Pomacanthidae). No feeding preferences were observed for the rabbitfish Siganus rivulatus under laboratory conditions. Exposure to elevated pCO(2) had no direct effect on the overall algal consumption by T. gratilla and S. rivulatus. Our results show that CO2 has the potential to alter algal palatability to different herbivores which could have important implications for algal abundance and coral community structure. The fact that pCO(2) effects were observed only at a pCO(2) of 4,000 mu atm, however, indicates that algal-grazer interactions may be resistant to predicted pCO(2) concentrations in the near future.","[Borell, E.

The likelihood of further loss of functions and resilience is dependent, in part, on the extent of functional redundancy (i.e. the capacity of one species to functionally compensate for the loss of another species) within critical functional groups. We used multiple metrics; species richness, generic richness, abundance and reserve capacity (i.e. the relative number of individuals available to fulfil the function if the numerically dominant species is lost), as indicators to assess the potential functional redundancy of four functional groups of herbivorous fishes (browsers, excavators, grazers and scrapers) in two of the worlds' most intact coral reef ecosystems: the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia. We found marked variations in potential redundancy among habitats within each reef system and functional groups. Despite negligible fishing of herbivorous fishes, coastal habitats in both reef systems had lower functional redundancy compared to offshore locations for all herbivorous fishes collectively and the four functional groups independently. This pattern was consistent in all four indicators of redundancy. The potential vulnerability of these coastal habitats is highlighted by recent shifts from coral to macroalgal dominance on several coastal reefs of the GBR. Our approach provides a simple yet revealing evaluation of potential functional redundancy. Moreover, it highlights the spatial variation in potential vulnerability and resilience of reef systems.","[Johansson, C.

While numerous studies have quantified the roles of parrotfishes and surgeonfishes on coral reefs, the rabbitfishes (f. Siganidae) have been largely overlooked. Consequently, they are typically viewed as a uniform group of grazing or browsing fishes. Here, we quantify the diet and distribution of rabbitfish assemblages on six reefs spanning the continental shelf in the northern Great Barrier Reef. Our results revealed marked variation in the diet and distribution of rabbitfish species. Analysis of stomach contents identified four distinct groups: browsers of leathery brown macroalgae (Siganus canaliculatus, S. javus), croppers of red and green macroalgae (S. argenteus, S. corallinus, S. doliatus, S. spinus) and mixed feeders of diverse algal material, cyanobacteria, detritus and sediment (S. lineatus, S. punctatissimus, S. punctatus, S. vulpinus). Surprisingly, the diet of the fourth group (S. puellus) contained very little algal material (22.5 %) and was instead dominated by sponges (69.1 %). Together with this variation in diet, the distribution of rabbitfishes displayed clear cross-shelf variation. Biomass was greatest on inner-shelf reefs (112.7 +/- A 18.2 kg.ha(-1)), decreasing markedly on mid- (37.8 +/- A 4.6 kg.ha(-1)) and outer-shelf reefs (9.7 +/- A 2.2 kg.ha(-1)). This pattern was largely driven by the browsing S. canaliculatus that accounted for 50 % of the biomass on inner-shelf reefs, but was absent in mid- and outer-shelf reefs. Mixed feeders, although primarily restricted to the reef slope and back reef habitats, also decreased in abundance and biomass from inshore to offshore, while algal cropping taxa were the dominant group on mid-shelf reefs. These results clearly demonstrate the extent to which diet and distribution vary within the Siganidae and emphasise the importance of examining function on a species-by-species basis.","[Hoey, A.

This paper provides detailed descriptions of aggregation formation and mass spawning of the Bermuda chub (Kyphosus sectatrix). Spawning coloration and gamete release of K. sectatrix were observed and filmed at the Grammanik Bank, a deep spawning aggregation site used by many different species located on the southern edge of the Puerto Rican shelf 10 km south of St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands. Underwater visual surveys using technical Nitrox and closed circuit re-breathers were conducted from December 2002 to March 2013 and documented spatial and temporal patterns of movement and aggregation formation along 1.5 km of mesophotic reef. The largest aggregations of K. sectatrix (> 200 fish) were observed on the Grammanik Bank January to March from 0 to 11 d after the full moon with peak abundance from 60 to 80 d after the winter solstice across all survey years. Aggregation formation of K. sectatrix coincided with the spawning season of Nassau (Epinephelus striatus) and yellowfin (Mycteroperca venenosa) groupers. These spatial and temporal patterns of aggregation formation and spawning suggest that K. sectatrix, an herbivore, may also be a transient aggregating species. On several occasions, chubs were observed both pair spawning and mass spawning. Color patterns and behaviors associated with aggregation and spawning are described and compared to spawning characteristics observed in other species, many of which are similar but others that appear unique to K. sectatrix. This represents the first report of a kyphosid species aggregating to spawn and illuminates a portion of the poorly understood life history of the Bermuda chub.","[Nemeth, Richard S.; Kadison, Elizabeth] Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, St Thomas, VI 00802 USA",6,10.1007/s00338-013-1050-0,2013

In this study, patterns of movement and home range for Lethrinus harak and Lethrinus obsoletus were quantified using an array of 33 acoustic receivers that covered approximately three quarters of Piti Marine Reserve in the Pacific island of Guam. This array was designed to ensure extensive overlap of receiver ranges throughout the study area. Eighteen individuals (12 L. harak and 6 L. obsoletus) were surgically implanted with ultrasonic transmitters and passively tracked for 4 months. Both species displayed high site fidelity and had relatively small home ranges. The home ranges of L. harak expanded with increasing body size. Feeding of fish by humans, which was common but restricted to a small area within the study site, had little effect on the distribution of the resident populations. L. harak made nightly spawning migrations within the reserve between full moon and last quarter moon of each lunar cycle, coinciding with a strong ebbing tide. Results indicate that even small reserves can include many individual home ranges of these emperorfishes and can protect spawning sites for L. harak. These species are heavily targeted in Guam, and there are major demographic differences between fished and protected sites. This study shows the potential for protected areas to sustain reproductive viability in exploited populations.","[Taylor, B.

S. nigricans and C. citrinellus relied mostly on turf algae and presented similar trophic levels and delta N-15 values, whereas E. merra fed on large invertebrates (crabs and shrimps) and had higher trophic levels and delta N-15 values. Discrepancies existed between stomach content and stable isotope analyses for the relative importance of food items. Bayesian mixing models indicated that sedimented organic matter was also an important additional food for S. nigricans and C. citrinellus, and fishes for E. merra. The main sources of organic matter involved in the food webs ending with these species were algal turfs and surface sediments, while water particulate organic matter was barely used. Significant spatial differences in C and N isotopic ratios for sources and fishes were found within and between bays. Lower C-13 and higher N-15 values were observed for various compartments of the studied trophic network at the end of each bay than at the entrance. Differences were observed between bays, with organic sources and consumers being, on average, slightly more C-13-depleted and N-15-enriched in Cook's Bay than in Opunohu Bay, linked with a higher mean annual flow of the river at Cook's Bay. Our results suggest that rivers bring continental material into these two bays, which is partly incorporated into the food webs of fringing coral reefs at least close to river mouths. Thus, continental inputs can influence the transfer of organic matter within coral reef food webs depending on the diet of organisms.","[Letourneur, Y.] Univ Nouvelle Caledonie, Lab LIVE, Labex Corail, Noumea 98851, New Caledonia; [de Loma, T.

The uniformity in delta N-15(TDN) during high tide (3.2 +/- A 0.3 aEuro degrees) indicated that the DON was mainly derived from offshore waters. In contrast, higher spatial heterogeneity of delta N-15(TDN) (3.1 +/- A 0.9 aEuro degrees) and DON concentrations during low tide indicated the existence of local DON sources patchily distributed over the reef. Low delta N-15(TDN) values located mid-reef were indicative of DON release from organisms that obtained their N via N-2 fixation, whereas high delta N-15(TDN) appeared to reflect localized release of DON by organisms exposed to dissolved inorganic nitrogen with elevated N-15, such as from terrestrial and offshore inputs.

In January 2011, the Mary River near Hervey Bay experienced its eleventh highest flood on record. The Mary River catchment has been highly modified since European colonisation, and, as a result of heavy rain and flooding, Hervey Bay was exposed to reduced salinity and elevated levels of turbidity and nutrients for approximately 14 weeks. Through the use of photograph transects and point intercept analysis, per cent cover of coral reef benthic communities was measured prior to and just after the flooding event. Sites were located between 250 m and 5 km from the mainland and from 18 to 85 km away from the mouth of the Mary River. Overall, there was a similar to 40 % reduction in coral cover post-flood, including significant mortality up to 89 % at four of six reefs. Mortality did not vary with distance along the coast from the Mary River, but mortality was found to be highest closer to the mainland, where turbidity and nutrients levels were also the highest. Despite the decades of input of highly turbid and nutrient laden waters from the Mary River, recovery has occurred in the past, and, given the persistence of similar conditions, would be expected to take place again. Climate change predicts increased frequency of severe storms and flooding, and this, combined with elevated sedimentation and nutrients from the highly modified catchment, may reduce these recovery periods, resulting in the deterioration of Hervey Bay reef communities.","[Butler, I.

As the northern extension of the Florida Reef Tract (FRT), the third-largest barrier reef ecosystem in the world, southeast Florida (25-27 degrees N latitude) is a prime region to study such effects. Most of the shallow-water FRT benthic habitats have been mapped, however minimal data and limited knowledge exist about the coral reef communities of its northernmost reaches off Martin County. First benthic habitat mapping was conducted using newly acquired high resolution LIDAR bathymetry and aerial photography where possible to map the spatial extent of coral reef habitats. Quantitative data were collected to characterize benthic cover and stony coral demographics and a comprehensive accuracy assessment was performed. The data were then analyzed in a habitat biogeography context to determine if a new coral reef ecosystem region designation was warranted. Of the 374 km(2) seafloor mapped, 95.2% was Sand, 4.1% was Coral Reef and Colonized Pavement, and 0.7% was Other Delineations. Map accuracy assessment yielded an overall accuracy of 94.9% once adjusted for known map marginal proportions. Cluster analysis of cross-shelf habitat type and widths indicated that the benthic habitats were different than those further south and warranted designation of a new coral reef ecosystem region. Unlike the FRT further south, coral communities were dominated by cold-water tolerant species and LIDAR morphology indicated no evidence of historic reef growth during warmer climates. Present-day hydrographic conditions may be inhibiting poleward expansion of coral communities along Florida.

Polyopisthocotylean monogeneans usually attach to the surface of fish gills using highly specialized structures, the sclerotized clamps. In the original description of the protomicrocotylid species Lethacotyle fijiensis, described 60 years ago, the clamps were considered to be absent but few specimens were available and this observation was later questioned. In addition, genera within the family Protomicrocotylidae have either clamps of the ""gastrocotylid'' or the ""microcotylid'' types; this puzzled systematists because these clamp types are characteristic of distinct, major groups. Discovery of another, new, species of the genus Lethacotyle, has allowed us to explore the nature of the attachment structures in protomicrocotylids. Lethacotyle vera n. sp. is described from the gills of the carangid Caranx papuensis off New Caledonia. It is distinguished from Lethacotyle fijiensis, the only other species of the genus, by the length of the male copulatory spines. Sequences of 28S rDNA were used to build a tree, in which Lethacotyle vera grouped with other protomicrocotylids. The identity of the host fish was confirmed with COI barcodes. We observed that protomicrocotylids have specialized structures associated with their attachment organ, such as lateral flaps and transverse striations, which are not known in other monogeneans. We thus hypothesized that the clamps in protomicrocotylids were sequentially lost during evolution, coinciding with the development of other attachment structures. To test the hypothesis, we calculated the surfaces of clamps and body in 120 species of gastrocotylinean monogeneans, based on published descriptions. The ratio of clamp surface: body surface was the lowest in protomicrocotylids. We conclude that clamps in protomicrocotylids are vestigial organs, and that occurrence of ""gastrocotylid'' and simpler ""microcotylid'' clamps within the same family are steps in an evolutionary sequence, leading to the absence of these attributes in species of Lethacotyle.","[Justine, Jean-Lou; Rahmouni, Chahrazed; Schoelinck, Charlotte] Museum Natl Hist Nat, UMR Systemat Adaptat Evolut 7138, F-75231 Paris, France; [Gey, Delphine] Museum Natl Hist Nat, UMS Serv Systemat Mol 2700, F-75231 Paris, France; [Schoelinck, Charlotte] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Aquat Anim Hlth, Mol Biol, Moncton, NB, Canada; [Hoberg, Eric P.] ARS, USDA, US Natl Parasite Collect, Beltsville, MD USA",6,10.1371/journal.pone.0079155,2013

Most Tridacna species are listed by CITES and the IUCN Redlist, as their populations have been extensively harvested and depleted in many regions. Here, we survey Tridacna crocea and Tridacna maxima from the eastern Indian and western Pacific Oceans for mitochondrial (COI and 16S) and nuclear (ITS) sequence variation and consolidate these data with previous published results using phylogenetic analyses. We find deep intraspecific differentiation within both T. crocea and T. maxima. In T. crocea we describe a previously undocumented phylogeographic division to the east of Cenderawasih Bay (northwest New Guinea), whereas for T. maxima the previously described, distinctive lineage of Cenderawasih Bay can be seen to also typify western Pacific populations. Furthermore, we find an undescribed, monophyletic group that is evolutionarily distinct from named Tridacna species at both mitochondrial and nuclear loci. This cryptic taxon is geographically widespread with a range extent that minimally includes much of the central Indo-Pacific region. Our results reinforce the emerging paradigm that cryptic species are common among marine invertebrates, even for conspicuous and culturally significant taxa. Additionally, our results add to identified locations of genetic differentiation across the central Indo-Pacific and highlight how phylogeographic patterns may differ even between closely related and co-distributed species.","[Huelsken, Thomas; Keyse, Jude; Liggins, Libby; Treml, Eric A.; Riginos, Cynthia] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Penny, Shane] Charles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Casuarina, Australia; [Treml, Eric A.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Zool, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",23,10.1371/journal.pone.0080858,2013

Management of local stressors is widely advocated to bolster coral reef resilience, but the extent to which management of local stressors might affect future trajectories of reef state remains unclear. This is in part because of limited understanding of the cumulative impact of multiple stressors. Models are ideal tools to aid understanding of future reef state under alternative management and climatic scenarios, but to date few have been sufficiently developed to be useful as decision support tools for local management of coral reefs subject to multiple stressors. We used a simulation model of coral reefs to investigate the extent to which the management of local stressors (namely poor water quality and fishing) might influence future reef state under varying climatic scenarios relating to coral bleaching. We parameterised the model for Bolinao, the Philippines, and explored how simulation modelling can be used to provide decision support for local management. We found that management of water quality, and to a lesser extent fishing, can have a significant impact on future reef state, including coral recovery following bleaching-induced mortality. The stressors we examined interacted antagonistically to affect reef state, highlighting the importance of considering the combined impact of multiple stressors rather than considering them individually. Further, by providing explicit guidance for management of Bolinao's reef system, such as which course of management action will most likely to be effective over what time scales and at which sites, we demonstrated the utility of simulation models for supporting management. Aside from providing explicit guidance for management of Bolinao's reef system, our study offers insights which could inform reef management more broadly, as well as general understanding of reef systems.","[Gurney, Georgina G.] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Gurney, Georgina G.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Zool, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Melbourne-Thomas, Jessica] Dept Sustainabil Environm Water Populat & Communi, Australian Antarctic Div, Kingston, Tas, Australia; [Melbourne-Thomas, Jessica] Univ Tasmania, Antarctic Climate & Ecosyst Cooperat Res Ctr, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Geronimo, Rollan C.] Conservat Int Philippines, Quezon City, Philippines; [Alino, Perry M.] Univ Philippines, Inst Marine Sci, Quezon City 1101, Philippines; [Johnson, Craig R.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia",23,10.1371/journal.pone.0080137,2013

The current study investigated the epidemiology of Aplysina Red Band Syndrome (ARBS), a disease affecting the Caribbean sponge Aplysina cauliformis, at both the individual and population levels. The fates of marked healthy and ARBS-infected sponges were examined over the course of a year. Population-level impacts and transmission mechanisms of ARBS were investigated by monitoring two populations of A. cauliformis over a three year period using digital photography and diver-collected data, and analyzing these data with GIS techniques of spatial analysis. In this study, three commonly used spatial statistics (Ripley's K, Getis-Ord General G, and Moran's Index) were compared to each other and with direct measurements of individual interactions using join-counts, to determine the ideal method for investigating disease dynamics and transmission mechanisms in this system. During the study period, Hurricane Irene directly impacted these populations, providing an opportunity to assess potential storm effects on A. cauliformis and ARBS. Results: Infection with ARBS caused increased loss of healthy sponge tissue over time and a higher likelihood of individual mortality. Hurricane Irene had a dramatic effect on A. cauliformis populations by greatly reducing sponge biomass on the reef, especially among diseased individuals. Spatial analysis showed that direct contact between A. cauliformis individuals was the likely transmission mechanism for ARBS within a population, evidenced by a significantly higher number of contact-joins between diseased sponges compared to random. Of the spatial statistics compared, the Moran's Index best represented true connections between diseased sponges in the survey area.

Microbial composition assessment, with nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences (ca. 1400 bp) from the isolates (n = 31) and partial sequences (ca. 280 bp) from clone libraries (n = 349), revealed diverse bacterial communities and other sponge-associated microbes.

Extended analyses using ecological metrics comprising 142 OTUs supported the clear differentiation of bacterial community profiles among the sponge hosts and their ambient seawater. Phylogenetic analyses were insightful in defining clades representing shared bacterial communities, particularly between H. perlevis and the geographically distantly-related H. heliophila, but also among other sponges.

While the roles of bottom-up processes are better appreciated they are still viewed as principally affecting the outcome of top-down processes. Sponges on coral reefs are important members of the benthic community and provide a critically important functional linkage between water-column productivity and the benthos. As active suspension feeders sponges utilize the abundant autotrophic and heterotrophic picoplankton in the water column. As a result sponges across the Caribbean basin exhibit a consistent and significant pattern of greater biomass, tube extension rate, and species numbers with increasing depth. Likewise, the abundance of their food supply also increases along a depth gradient. Using experimental manipulations it has recently been reported that predation is the primary determinant of sponge community structure. Here we provide data showing that the size and growth of the sponge Callyspongia vaginalis are significantly affected by food availability. Sponges increased in size and tube extension rate with increasing depth down to 46 m, while simultaneously exposed to the full range of potential spongivores at all depths. Additionally, we point out important flaws in the experimental design used to demonstrate the role of predation and suggest that a resolution of this important question will require well-controlled, multi-factorial experiments to examine the independent and interactive effects of predation and food abundance on the ecology of sponges.","[Lesser, Michael P.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Mol Cellular & Biomed Sci, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Slattery, Marc] Univ Mississippi, Dept Pharmacognosy, University, MS 38677 USA",25,10.1371/journal.pone.0079799,2013

The management of ecological processes is a developing field that requires reliable indicators that can be monitored over time. Herbivory is a key ecological process on coral reefs, and pooling herbivorous fishes into functional groups based on their feeding mode is increasingly used as it may quantify herbivory in ways that indicate resilience. Here we evaluate whether the biomass estimates of these herbivore functional groups are good predictors of reef benthic assemblages, using data from 240 sites from five island groups in American Samoa. Using an information theoretic approach, we assembled a candidate set of linear and nonlinear models to identify the relations between benthic cover and total herbivore and non-herbivore biomass and the biomass of the aforementioned functional groups. For each benthic substrate type considered (encrusting algae, fleshy macroalgae, hard coral and turf algae), the biomass of herbivorous fishes were important explanatory variables in predicting benthic cover, whereas biomass of all fishes combined generally was not. Also, in all four cases, variation in cover was best explained by the biomass of specific functional groups rather than by all herbivores combined. Specifically: 1) macroalgal and turf algal cover decreased with increasing biomass of 'grazers/detritivores'; and 2) cover of encrusting algae increased with increasing biomass of 'grazers/detritivores' and browsers. Furthermore, hard coral cover increased with the biomass of large excavators/bio-eroders (made up of large-bodied parrotfishes). Collectively, these findings emphasize the link between herbivorous fishes and the benthic community and demonstrate support for the use of functional groups of herbivores as indicators for resilience-based monitoring.","[Heenan, Adel] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Joint Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Williams, Ivor D.] Pacific Islands Fisheries Sci Ctr, Coral Reef Ecosyst Div, Honolulu, HI USA",14,10.1371/journal.pone.0079604,2013

In order to investigate the performance of community-based fisheries management (CBFM) in Vanuatu, trajectories and factors of change in CBFM systems since the 1990s were analysed. Focal group interviews were conducted in seven villages on Efate island in 2011 and supplemented by a review of supporting literature. Results reveal the increasing and excessive reliance of CBFM systems on external agencies that promoted overly complex management plans. Examination of trends in CBFM systems shows that community and national fishing rules that were highly acceptable by local societies were more likely to be enforced in the long run. In particular, the establishment of marine reserves was the most widespread and best enforced community rule for the purposes of conservation, ecotourism, and/or fisheries. Overall, the results challenge the current effectiveness of CBFM in achieving sustainability of reef fisheries in Vanuatu, and highlight the over-reliance on small marine reserves as a management tool.

Alternative livelihood strategies which can generate income and simultaneously conserve fish stocks and their habitats are a priority. This paper investigates the feasibility of 'sport fishing' (recreational catch and release angling for particular species of predatory game fish) as such a strategy. The limited research of sport fisheries in developing countries is augmented with a review of community-based ecotourism, integrated conservation and development projects (ICDPs) and common property management literature to propose design principles. Five prerequisite principles for the success of sport fishery enterprises are suggested. First, adequate local capacity must be available to manage a tourism business and facilities, supported by cross-scale co-management amongst stakeholders. Second, appropriate governance arrangements must be in place to ensure the equitable dispersal of benefits to all members of the local community, and conflict resolution. Third, resource-ownership boundaries and rights must be clearly delineated before the enterprise begins in order to minimise the potential for future conflict. Fourth, social, biodiversity and ecosystem service co-benefits should result from the enterprise. These should include improvements in income, health, education, food security, the status of the target and non-target species and their habitat and non-fishery ecosystem services. Fifth, monitoring and evaluation of these principles is required within an adaptive co-management framework which takes a social-ecological systems approach and includes all stakeholders in social learning and power-sharing. Through this, broader impacts of the enterprise may emerge which go beyond the standard assessment of ecotourism and ICDP success in financial or biodiversity terms. These principles now need to be tested by researching the experiences of case studies of sport fishing enterprises in the Pacific. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this sense, additive partitioning might be useful since it quantifies the contribution of alpha and beta to total diversity across different scales. We applied this approach using an unbalanced design across four hierarchical scales (80 sites, 22 subregions, six ecoregions, and the Caribbean basin). Reef-fish species were compiled from the Reef Environmental Education Foundation (REEF) database and distributions were confirmed with published data. Permutation tests were used to compare observed values to those expected by chance. The primary objective was to identify patterns of reef-fish diversity across multiple spatial scales under different scenarios, examining factors such as fisheries and demographic connectivity. Total diversity at the Caribbean scale was attributed to beta-diversity (nearly 62% of the species), with the highest beta-diversity at the site scale. (alpha) over bar -diversity was higher than expected by chance in all scenarios and at all studied scales. This suggests that fish assemblages are more homogenous than expected, particularly at the ecoregion scale. Within each ecoregion, diversity was mainly attributed to alpha, except for the Southern ecoregion where there was a greater difference in species among sites. beta-components were lower than expected in all ecoregions, indicating that fishes within each ecoregion are a subsample of the same species pool. The scenario involving the effects of fisheries showed a shift in dominance for beta-diversity from regions to subregions, with no major changes to the diversity patterns. In contrast, demographic connectivity partially explained the diversity pattern. beta-components were low within connectivity regions and higher than expected by chance when comparing between them. Our results highlight the importance of ecoregions as a spatial scale to conserve local and regional coral reef-fish diversity.","[Francisco-Ramos, Vanessa; Ernesto Arias-Gonzalez, Jesus] Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Invest & Estudios Avanzados, Dept Recursos Mar, Unidad Merida, Merida, Yucatan, Mexico",13,10.1371/journal.pone.0078761,2013

While we have gained insights into how fin morphology and motion influences swimming performance in coral reef fishes, the role of other traits, such as body shape, remains poorly understood. We explore the ability of two mechanistic models of the causal relationship between body fineness ratio and endurance swimming-performance to predict maximum prolonged-swimming speed (U-max) among 84 fish species from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. A drag model, based on semi-empirical data on the drag of rigid, submerged bodies of revolution, was applied to species that employ pectoral-fin propulsion with a rigid body at U-max. An alternative model, based on the results of computer simulations of optimal shape in self-propelled undulating bodies, was applied to the species that swim by body-caudal-fin propulsion at U-max. For pectoral-fin swimmers, U-max increased with fineness, and the rate of increase decreased with fineness, as predicted by the drag model. While the mechanistic and statistical models of the relationship between fineness and U-max were very similar, the mechanistic (and statistical) model explained only a small fraction of the variance in U-max. For body-caudal-fin swimmers, we found a non-linear relationship between fineness and U-max, which was largely negative over most of the range of fineness. This pattern fails to support either predictions from the computational models or standard functional interpretations of body shape variation in fishes. Our results suggest that the widespread hypothesis that a more optimal fineness increases endurance-swimming performance via reduced drag should be limited to fishes that swim with rigid bodies.","[Walker, Jeffrey A.] Univ So Maine, Dept Biol Sci, Portland, ME 04103 USA; [Alfaro, Michael E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Noble, Mae M.; Fulton, Christopher J.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Canberra, ACT, Australia",14,10.1371/journal.pone.0075422,2013

These proxy records of environmental change are preserved as geochemical signals in the carbonate skeletons of scleractinian corals and are useful for reconstructions of temporal and spatial fluctuations in the physical and chemical environments of coral reef ecosystems, including The Great Barrier Reef (GBR). We compared multi-year monitoring of water temperature and dissolved elements with analyses of chemical proxies recorded in Porites coral skeletons to identify the divergent mechanisms driving environmental variation at inshore versus offshore reefs. At inshore reefs, water Ba/Ca increased with the onset of monsoonal rains each year, indicating a dominant control of flooding on inshore ambient chemistry. Inshore multi-decadal records of coral Ba/Ca were also highly periodic in response to flood-driven pulses of terrigenous material. In contrast, an offshore reef at the edge of the continental shelf was subject to annual upwelling of waters that were presumed to be richer in Ba during summer months. Regular pulses of deep cold water were delivered to the reef as indicated by in situ temperature loggers and coral Ba/Ca. Our results indicate that although much of the GBR is subject to periodic environmental fluctuations, the mechanisms driving variation depend on proximity to the coast. Inshore reefs are primarily influenced by variable freshwater delivery and terrigenous erosion of catchments, while offshore reefs are dominated by seasonal and inter-annual variations in oceanographic conditions that influence the propensity for upwelling. The careful choice of sites can help distinguish between the various factors that promote Ba uptake in corals and therefore increase the utility of corals as monitors of spatial and temporal variation in environmental conditions.","[Walther, Benjamin D.] Univ Texas Austin, Inst Marine Sci, Port Aransas, TX USA; [Walther, Benjamin D.; McCulloch, Malcolm T.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Kingsford, Michael J.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [McCulloch, Malcolm T.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Environm, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Crawley, WA, Australia",11,10.1371/journal.pone.0077091,2013

Here we demonstrate that the extraordinary success of the introduced lionfish lies in its capacity to circumvent prey risk assessment abilities as it is virtually undetectable by prey species in its native range. While experienced prey damselfish, Chromis viridis, respond with typical antipredator behaviours when exposed to a common predatory rock cod (Cephalopholis microprion) they fail to visibly react to either the scent or visual presentation of the red lionfish, and responded only to the scent (not the visual cue) of a lionfish of a different genus, Dendrochirus zebra. Experienced prey also had much higher survival when exposed to the two non-invasive predators compared to P. volitans.

Organisms living in shallow coral reef environments possess UV absorbing compounds, such as mycosporine-like amino acids, to protect them from UV radiation. While it has been demonstrated that exposure to UV (280-400 nm) affects the UV absorbance of fish mucus, whether the effects of UV exposure vary between UVB and UVA wavelengths is not known. Therefore, we investigated whether the UVB, UVA, or photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm) portions of the spectrum affected the UV absorbance of epithelial mucus and Fulton's body condition index of the cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus. We also compared field-measured UV absorbance with laboratory based high-performance liquid chromatography measurements of mycosporine-like amino acid concentrations. After 1 week, we found that the UV absorbance of epithelial mucus was higher in the UVB+UVA+PAR treatment compared with the UVA+PAR and PAR only treatments; after 2 and 3 weeks, however, differences between treatments were not detected. After 3 weeks, Fulton's body condition index was lower for fish in the UVB+UVA+PAR compared with PAR and UVA+PAR treatments; furthermore, all experimentally treated fish had a lower Fulton's body condition index than did freshly caught fish. Finally, we found a decrease with depth in the UV absorbance of mucus of wild-caught fish. This study suggests that the increase in UV absorbance of fish mucus in response to increased overall UV levels is a function of the UVB portion of the spectrum. This has important implications for the ability of cleaner fish and other fishes to adjust their mucus UV protection in response to variations in environmental UV exposure.","[Zamzow, Jill P.; Eckes, Maxi J.; Grutter, Alexandra S.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Siebeck, Ulrike E.; Eckes, Maxi J.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biomed Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",5,10.1371/journal.pone.0078527,2013

We then used this model, prior information and the data within a Bayesian framework to approximate the posterior distribution of the growth parameters. For all species the two-parameter von Bertalanffy growth model provided the best fit to size-at-age datasets. Based on this model, the Bayesian approach allowed the estimation of median values of W-D infinity (cm) and k (yr(-1)) for the four species (H. uarnak: 149 and 0.12; N. kuhlii: 42 and 0.38; P. atrus 156 and 0.16, and T. lymma 33 and 0.24, respectively).

We found a marked lack of temporal congruence within and among the three fish families in vicariance events associated with the EPB, TTE and IOP. Vicariance across hard barriers separating the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific (TTE, IOP) is temporally diffuse, with many vicariance events preceding barrier formation. In marked contrast, soft barriers either side of the IAA hotspot support tightly concordant vicariance events (2.5 Myr on Indian Ocean side; 6 Myr on Central Pacific side). Temporal concordance in vicariance points to large-scale temporally restricted gene flow during the Late Miocene and Pliocene.

The 1997-8 El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) had notable and severe impacts on coral reefs worldwide, but not all reef organisms were negatively impacted by this large-scale event. Here we describe how the sponge fauna at Bahia, Brazil was influenced by the 1997-8 ENSO event. Sponge assemblages from three contrasting reef habitats (reef tops, walls and shallow banks) at four sites were assessed annually from 1995 to 2011. The within-habitat sponge diversity did not vary significantly across the study period; however, there was a significant increase in density in all habitats. Multivariate analyses revealed no significant difference in sponge assemblage composition (ANOSIM) between pre- and post-ENSO years for any of the habitats, suggesting that neither the 1997-8 nor any subsequent smaller ENSO events have had any measurable impact on the reef sponge assemblage. Importantly, this is in marked contrast to the results previously reported for a suite of other taxa (including corals, echinoderms, bryozoans, and ascidians), which all suffered mass mortalities as a result of the ENSO event. Our results suggest that of all reef taxa, sponges have the potential to be resilient to large-scale thermal stress events and we hypothesize that sponges might be less affected by projected increases in sea surface temperature compared to other major groups of reef organisms.","[Kelmo, Francisco] Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Biol, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Bell, James J.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington, New Zealand; [Attrill, Martin J.] Univ Plymouth, Inst Marine, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",14,10.1371/journal.pone.0076441,2013

The relative abundance and population structure of C. perezi off Cape Eleuthera, The Bahamas, was surveyed by standardised longline surveys from May 2008 to October 2011, which resulted in the capture of 331 sharks. Abundance peaked in the summer and was lowest during the winter. Females were 1.6 times more abundant than males and the assemblage was dominated by immature female sharks (45.5 %). The abundance of mature male and female sharks peaked a month apart in June and August, respectively. All 331 sharks were tagged and released with 15.4 % being recaptured after periods at liberty between 5 and 1,159 days (Mean = 333.4 +/- A 42.7 SE). The mean distance between tagging and recapture was 1.77 km for recaptures in excess of 6 months, indicating seasonally stratified philopatry in this species. C. perezi inhabiting Bahamian waters have developed complex habitat use patterns that are both spatiotemporally and demographically segregated, most probably in response to the large and diverse habitat mosaic available on the Bahamas Banks compared to contemporary study sites. This study represents an important step in understanding the spatiotemporal population structure of C. perezi and illustrates the potential for studies examining behavioural plasticity in response to environmental variation and anthropogenic disturbance.","[Brooks, Edward J.] Cape Eleuthera Inst, Shark Res & Conservat Program, Eleuthera, Bahamas; [Brooks, Edward J.] Univ Plymouth, Inst Marine, Sch Marine Sci & Engn, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Sims, David W.] Marine Biol Assoc UK, The Lab, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Sims, David W.] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; [Sims, David W.] Univ Southampton, Ctr Biol Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Danylchuk, Andy J.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Sloman, Katherine A.] Univ West Scotland, Sch Sci, Paisley, Renfrew, Scotland",17,10.1007/s00227-013-2246-0,2013

In this study, we analysed patterns of growth in three abundant sublittoral sponges from the western Mediterranean Sea, chosen for their close phylogenetic relatedness, sympatric distribution, and contrasting amounts of photosymbionts: high in Ircinia fasciculata, lower in I. variabilis, and absent in I. oros. Sponge area, perimeter, number of oscula, and epibiont abundance were quantified from in situ digital images taken monthly for 1.5 years and volumetric growth rates were calculated from empirical area-volume relationships. Volumetric growth rates were different among species and coherent with the photosymbiont abundance: high in I. fasciculata (40.03 +/- A 4.81 % year(-1), mean +/- A SE), low in I. variabilis (5.65 +/- A 6.11 % year(-1)), and almost nil in I. oros (-0.04 +/- A 3.02 % year(-1)). Furthermore, a marked seasonality was observed in the first two species, with greater growth during the warm season. The high growth rates of I. fasciculata were likely fuelled by symbiont-derived photosynthates and required to compete in the well-lit, algal-dominated habitats this species prefers. In contrast, I. variabilis and I. oros tended to dwell in shaded habitats, where competition from slow-growing invertebrates is intense, and featured lower growth rates. The flattened morphology and lower circularity of I. variabilis indicates a capacity for adaptation to any space that is freed, while I. oros had less oscula and was more massive and circular, suggesting a strategy of passive occupation and minimisation of biological interactions. The results show that even congeneric species living sympatrically can achieve important biomass using different growth and substrate occupation strategies.","[Turon, Xavier] Ctr Adv Studies Blanes CEAB CSIC, Blanes 17300, Girona, Spain; [Garriga, Anna; Erwin, Patrick M.] Univ Barcelona, Dept Anim Biol, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain",3,10.1007/s00227-013-2267-8,2013

The system as a whole interacts with symbiotic eukaryotes, bacteria and viruses. Gemmocystis cylindrus (cf. ""type-N"" symbiont) belonging to the obligatory parasitic phylum Apicomplexa (Alveolata) is ubiquitous in the Caribbean coral, but its presence in the Great Barrier Reef coral has yet to be documented. Approaches allowing identification of the healthy community from the pathogenic or saprobic organisms are needed for sustainable coral reef monitoring. Methods & Principal Findings: We investigated the diversity of eukaryotes associated with a common reef-building corals from the southern Great Barrier Reef. We used three tag encoded 454 amplicon pyrosequencing assays targeting eukaryote small-subunit rRNA gene to demonstrate the presence of the apicomplexan type-N and a photosynthetic sister species to Apicomplexa - Chromera velia. Amplicon pyrosequencing revealed presence of the small-subunit rRNA genes of known eukaryotic pathogens (Cryptosporidium and Cryptococcus). We therefore conducted bacterial tag encoded amplicon pyrosequencing assay for small-subunit rRNA gene to support effluent exposure of the coral. Bacteria of faecal origin (Enterobacteriales) formed 41% of total sequences in contrast to 0-2% of the coral-associated bacterial communities with and without C. velia, respectively. Significance: This is the first time apicomplexan type-N has been detected in the Great Barrier Reef. Eukaryote tag encoded amplicon pyrosequencing assays demonstrate presence of apicomplexan type-N and C. Velia in total coral DNA. The data highlight the need for combined approaches for eukaryotic diversity studies coupled with bacterial community assessment to achieve a more realistic goals of defining the holobiont community and assessing coral disease. With increasing evidence of Apicomplexa in coral reef environments, it is important not only to understand the evolution of these organisms but also identify their potential as pathogens.","[Slapeta, Jan] Univ Sydney, Fac Vet Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Linares, Marjorie C.] Univ Sydney, Sch Mol Biosci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",10,10.1371/journal.pone.0076095,2013

However, effects of ARs on marine communities remain unknown, because it is unclear whether ARs can maintain similar communities to natural reefs. We investigated whether well-established (>30 years old) breakwaters could consistently approximate fish assemblages on interspersed rocky reefs in a temperate estuary over 6 consecutive seasons using regular visual surveys between June 2009 (winter) and November 2010 (spring). We examined whether assemblage differences between reef types were driven by differences in juvenile recruitment, or were related to differences in older life-stages. Assemblages on both reef types were dominated by juveniles (61% of individuals) and sub-adults (34% of individuals). Seasonal fluctuations in assemblage parameters (species richness, diversity, sub-adult abundance) were similar between reef types, and levels of species diversity and assemblage composition were generally comparable. However, abundance and species richness were consistently higher (1.9-7.6 and 1.3-2.6 times, respectively) on breakwaters. These assemblage differences could not be explained by differences in juvenile recruitment, with seasonal patterns of recruitment and juvenile species found to be similar between reef types. In contrast, abundances of sub-adults were consistently higher (1.1-12 times) at breakwaters, and assemblage differences appeared to be driven by this life-stage. Our results indicate that breakwaters in temperate estuaries are capable of supporting abundant and diverse fish assemblages with similar recruitment process to natural reefs. However, breakwaters may not approximate all aspects of natural assemblage structure, with differences maintained by a single-life stage in some cases.","[Fowler, Ashley M.; Booth, David J.] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Environm, Fish Ecol Lab, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",11,10.1371/journal.pone.0075790,2013

Of particular concern is the ability of systems to recover where multiple stressors act simultaneously. We examine this issue in the context of a coral reef ecosystem where increases in stressors, such as fisheries, benthic degradation, cyclones and coral bleaching, are occurring at global scales. By utilizing long-term (decadal) monitoring programs, we examined the combined effects of chronic (removal of sharks) and pulse (cyclones, bleaching) disturbances on the trophic structure of coral reef fishes at two isolated atoll systems off the coast of northwest Australia. We provide evidence consistent with the hypothesis that the loss of sharks can have an impact that propagates down the food chain, potentially contributing to mesopredator release and altering the numbers of primary consumers. Simultaneously, we show how the effects of bottom-up processes of bleaching and cyclones appear to propagate up the food chain through herbivores, planktivores and corallivores, but do not affect carnivores. Because their presence may promote the abundance of herbivores, the removal of sharks by fishing has implications for both natural and anthropogenic disturbances involving the loss of corals, as herbivores are critical to the progress and outcome of coral recovery.","[Ruppert, Jonathan L.

We examined whether ecological components of vulnerability varied between government operated no-take marine reserves, community-based reserves, and openly fished areas. Overall, fished sites were marginally more vulnerable than community-based and government marine reserves. Social sensitivity was indicated by the occupational composition of each community, including the importance of fishing relative to other occupations, as well as the susceptibility of different fishing gears to the effects of coral bleaching on target fish species. Key components of social adaptive capacity varied considerably between the communities.

Recruitment of A. elisabethae was monitored in 20, 1-m(2) quadrats at 8 sites along the southern edge of the Little Bahama Bank from 2004 through 2007. A. elisabethae has been harvested in The Bahamas for over fifteen years and all of the sites had been harvested three times, including a harvest during the course of the study. Abundances of adult colonies at those sites as well as a location that had not been harvested were also determined. Recruitment was highly variable, differing between sites, transects within sites, and, depending on the site, between years. Recruitment was best correlated with adult abundance averaged across the surrounding site. Regression analyses suggest abundance on smaller scales had only small effects on recruitment. The effects of the harvesting were site specific ranging from a 38 to 67% reduction in the density of mature colonies. The sites with the most abundant A. elisabethae continued to have the highest abundances after harvesting and there was no significant difference in recruitment before and after harvesting. Population size-structure at 6 of 8 sites that have been harvested multiple times exhibited an overall depletion in small colonies suggesting long term suppression of recruitment and declining populations. Severe depression of adult abundances coupled with local recruitment can create a negative feedback and lead to the decline of local populations. Populations that are dependent on self-recruitment are not resilient to large disturbance events.","[Lasker, Howard R.] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Geol, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Lasker, Howard R.] SUNY Buffalo, Grad Program Evolut Ecol & Behav, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA",11,10.1371/journal.pone.0074587,2013

However, the consequences of these preferences for distribution and abundance, and the underlying basis of habitat preferences are often unknown. The present study, conducted at Great Keppel Island, Australia, examined how distribution and abundance of an obligate corallivorous filefish, Oxymonacanthus longirostris, relates to coral architecture and diversity. The main drivers of the distribution and abundance of O. longirostris among reefs were coral species richness and availability of branching coral. Feeding territories had a higher percentage of Acropora coral than surrounding habitat. In addition, feeding territories had a higher percentage of the structurally important branching coral, Acropora nobilis, and a primary prey species, Acropora millepora. A series of pair-wise choice experiments in which both structural complexity and coral tissue quality were independently manipulated showed that habitat choice was primarily based on structural complexity and shelter characteristics. In addition, the choice for the preferred coral (A. nobilis) was stronger in the presence of a piscivorous fish. These results indicate that species-diverse coral habitats, which provide sufficient structural complexity along with nutritionally important prey, are essential for population persistence of this small, corallivorous reef fish.","[Brooker, R.

A. polyacanthus populations displayed strong intraspecific variation in swimming morphology and performance that matched local levels of water motion: individuals on reefs subject to high water motion displayed higher aspect-ratio fins and faster swimming speeds than conspecifics on sheltered reefs. Remarkably, intraspecific variation within A. polyacanthus spanned over half the diversity seen among closely related damselfish species from the same region.

Through a 7-yr monitoring effort in Quintana Roo, Mexico, we show that delta N-15 values of the common sea fan Gorgonia ventalina were more variable near a developed (Akumal) site than at an undeveloped (Mahahual) site. Beginning in 2007, the global recession decreased tourist visitations to Akumal, which corresponded with a pronounced 1.6 aEuro degrees decline in sea fan delta N-15 through 2009, at which time delta N-15 values were similar to those from Mahahual. With the recovery of tourism, delta N-15 values increased to previous levels. Overall, 84 % of the observed variation in delta N-15 was explained by tourist visitations in the preceding year alone, indicating that variable nitrogen source contributions are correlated with sea fan delta N-15 values. We also found that annual precipitation accounted for some variation in delta N-15, likely due to its role in groundwater flushing into the sea. Together, these factors accounted for 96 % of the variation in delta N-15. Using a mixing model, we estimate that sewage can account for up to 42 % of nitrogen in sea fan biomass. These findings illustrate the high connectivity between land-based activities and coral reef productivity and the measurable impact of the tourism industry on the ecosystem it relies on.","[Baker, D.

However, the effects of COTS on the high diversity reefs in Indonesia have been largely overlooked. In 2007, high densities of COTS were observed in two regions of Indonesia: Aceh and Halmahera. Densities of COTS ranged from 0 to 52 starfish 2,000 m(2) across 24 sites in Aceh and from 0 to 18 starfish 2,000 m(2) at 10 sites in Halmahera. Mortality rates of Acropora spp. were very high at affected sites: over 50 % of colonies had been killed at seven of the 16 affected sites. A review of historical sources going back to 1969 suggests that COTS have damaged many reefs throughout Indonesia, including much activity within the Indonesian section of the Coral Triangle. Furthermore, the data suggest that COTS activity has increased rapidly since 2000. Very little of this activity has been reported in the primary literature, and there is a general lack of awareness in Indonesia of COTS as a potential cause of reef degradation. This lack of awareness, combined with limited monitoring efforts, means that damage caused by COTS is often attributed to other causes, such as destructive fishing, bleaching or tsunami. COTS are clearly a major source of coral mortality in Indonesia of which scientists and government need to be more cognizant.","[Baird, A. H.; Pratchett, M. S.; Hoey, A.

Images used for the marine environment suffer from environmental limitation (water absorption, scattering, and glint); sensor-related limitations (spectral and spatial resolution); and habitat limitation (substrate spectral similarity). Presented here is an advanced approach for ground-level surveying of a coral reef using a hyperspectral camera (400-1,000 nm) that is able to address all of these limitations. Used from the surface, the image includes a white reference plate that offers a solution for correcting the water column effect. The imaging system produces millimeter size pixels and 80 relevant bands. The data collected have the advantages of both a field point spectrometer (hyperspectral resolution) and a digital camera (spatial resolution). Finally, the availability of pure pixel imagery significantly improves the potential for substrate recognition in comparison with traditionally used remote sensing mixed pixels. In this study, an image of a coral reef table in the Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea, was classified, demonstrating the benefits of this technology for the first time. Preprocessing includes testing of two normalization approaches, three spectral resolutions, and two spectral ranges. Trained classification was performed using support vector machine that was manually trained and tested against a digital image that provided empirical verification. For the classification of 5 core classes, the best results were achieved using a combination of a 450-660 nm spectral range, 5 nm wide bands, and the employment of red-band normalization. Overall classification accuracy was improved from 86 % for the original image to 99 % for the normalized image. Spectral resolution and spectral ranges seemed to have a limited effect on the classification accuracy. The proposed methodology and the use of automatic classification procedures can be successfully applied for reef survey and monitoring and even upscaled for a large survey.","[Caras, T.; Karnieli, A.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Remote Sensing Lab, IL-84990 Beer Sheva, Israel",5,10.1007/s00338-013-1033-1,2013

Social behavior is known to influence the ecological role of fishes; however, the ecological basis for pairing in reef fishes is not well understood. Field observations of 2,753 individuals, in 47 species in six families of biting reef fishes (Acanthuridae, Chaetodontidae, Kyphosidae, Labridae, Pomacanthidae, Siganidae), were used in combination with six morphological measurements, to examine the morphology of fishes in different social systems. A principal components analysis of morphological traits segregated species with high proportions of pairing individuals from non-pairing species along principal component 1, explaining 40.8 % of the variation. Pairing species were characterized by large eyes, concave foreheads, pointed snouts, deep bodies, and small maximum sizes. There was a significant positive relationship between these morphological traits (i.e., scores on PC1) and the prevalence of pairing within the Chaetodontidae (r (2) = 0.59; P = 0.026), Siganidae (r (2) = 0.72; P = 0.004), and Acanthuridae (r (2) = 0.82; P < 0.001). This was consistent when traits were corrected for phylogenetic effects. No pattern was evident in the scarine Labridae (r (2) = 0.15; P = 0.17). The morphological characteristics found among pairing species suggest that pairing species share common ecological traits, including foraging for small prey items in micro-topographically complex environments such as reef crevices. These ecological traits may have played a role in the evolution of pairing behavior and subsequently led to the development of reproductive patterns based on monogamy.","[Brandl, S. J.; Bellwood, D.

It was shown that initial phases (IP) and terminal phases (TP) Halichoeres, were influenced by wave exposure, although foraging in Halichoeres brasiliensis TP was not influenced by wave exposure. The IP in all three species were positively associated with rugosity and algal cover while the TP was positively associated with depth. Habitat complexity also influences foraging in these species. Group size influenced foraging activity, except in H. brasiliensis TP. We also found variations in microhabitat patches used for foraging between species and differences in the stomach contents between species and phases, showing that functional roles change in response to ontogenetic shifts.","[Nunes, Jose de Anchieta C.

Blenny species used different sized holes; however, the average diameter and depth of holes used by the smallest and largest species differed by only 4 and 25 mm, respectively, indicating interspecific differences in suitable refuge can be very subtle. Both hole diameter and depth were positively related to total length of fish, suggesting use of holes relates to interspecific differences in body size. Total abundance of blennies was best explained by a general linear model that included either the number of holes or total habitat area on individual micro-atolls, predictor variables that were positively correlated with each other. However, the relative importance of variables differed among the three species, feeding area being most important for S. patzneri, feeding area and number of holes for E. stictus, and variance in hole diameter being the best explanatory variable for G. delicatulus abundance. The number of blenny species on a micro-atoll was best explained by variance in hole diameter, emphasizing the influence of refuge size variety in fish diversity. It is likely that subtle habitat partitioning, which relates to interspecific differences in body size, contributes to the co-existence of blenny species within the same microhabitat, but presence of holes is unlikely to regulate abundance of these fish.","[Wilson, S.

Photosynthesis and respiration will elevate or depress the concentration of oxygen in the diffusive boundary layer. Likewise, acid-base regulation and biomineralization/dissolution for calcifying species can alter the relative concentration of inorganic carbon species and thus pH. Here, we measured the relative ability of several common benthic primary producers from coral reef systems of the central Pacific and the Caribbean to simultaneously affect seawater oxygen concentration and pH values. Repeated measurements over a diel cycle confirmed that several primary producers substantially alter surrounding seawater chemistry over time. The majority of fleshy algae exhibited a stoichiometric ratio of oxygen to hydrogen ions not significantly different from one during daylight hours. In contrast, calcifiers exhibited significantly lower oxygen to hydrogen ion ratios that were unique for each species and were inversely correlated with known rates of calcification. These data provide the first quantitative estimates of the simultaneous influence of several species of benthic primary producers on water column oxygen concentrations and pH across different tropical reef systems. Finally, because more productive fleshy taxa have the potential to raise both oxygen and pH during the day to a greater extent than calcified species, our results suggest that some fleshy taxa may provide a buffering capacity to future ocean acidification scenarios.","[Smith, Jennifer E.; Price, Nichole N.; Haas, Andreas F.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, San Diego, CA 92093 USA; [Nelson, Craig E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",25,10.1007/s00227-013-2239-z,2013

The Marine Protected Area Governance (MPAG) project examined a range of different incentives - economic, interpretative, knowledge, legal and participative - employed to address the driving forces and promote effectiveness in 20 case studies across the globe. This paper argues that, regardless of the MPA governance approach adopted (i.e., government-led, decentralised, private or community-led), resilience in MPA governance systems derives from employing a diversity of inter-connected incentives. The significance of institutional diversity to governance systems parallels that of species diversity to ecosystems, conferring resilience to the overall socio-ecological system. The paper concludes that, in the face of strong driving forces, rather than relying on particular types of incentives and institutions, it is important to recognise that the key to resilience is diversity, both of species in ecosystems and of institutions in governance systems.

The governance of such a large and iconic area is complex due to the overlapping federal and state (Queensland) jurisdictions. Since 1975 this globally significant area has been protected by pioneering federal legislation which enabled the 'reasonable use' of natural resources to co-exist with conservation, thus introducing the concept of a multiple-use marine park. In 1981 the Great Barrier Reef was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Area. Today a federal multiple-use Marine Park covers 99% of the Great Barrier Reef Region and World Heritage Area, with the remaining areas under state jurisdiction. A close working partnership between the federal and state governments has evolved over 37 years and includes complementary legislation, joint field management and joint permits. In the face of increasing pressures, management of the Great Barrier Reef continues to be effective for a range of reasons, including a sound governance/legislative framework together with complementary federal/state legislation; integrated management with relevant federal and state agencies; and the application of ecosystem-based management principles both inside and outside the area of the marine park's jurisdiction.

The governance approach adopted in the SCR-NMNR is characterised by significant decentralisation, i.e. many roles have been devolved to the local government. However, this has led to the undermining of strategic conservation objectives by local economic development priorities, through the rapid development of mass tourism involving both the private sector and the local government. This reliance on economic incentives has provided alternative livelihoods and resources for the management of the MPA, but has also incurred environmental and social costs. Overall, it can be argued that the current governance approach cannot effectively address the full spectrum of challenges encountered, in that these costs appear to outweigh the benefits. In order to improve the governance of the SCR-NMNR towards more effective and equitable outcomes, strengthened leadership from the central state will be needed, as well as a sense of community stewardship towards the MPA.

A range of sensory modalities are available for this learning, with visual and chemical cues being well-established modes of transmission in aquatic systems. The use of other sensory cues in mediating social learning in fishes, including mechano-sensory cues, remains unexplored. Here, we examine the role of different sensory cues in social learning of predator recognition, using juvenile damselfish (Amphiprion percula). Specifically, we show that a predator-naive observer can socially learn to recognize a novel predator when paired with a predator-experienced conspecific in total darkness. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that when threatened, individuals release chemical cues (known as disturbance cues) into the water. These cues induce an anti-predator response in nearby individuals; however, they do not facilitate learnt recognition of the predator. As such, another sensory modality, probably mechano-sensory in origin, is responsible for information transfer in the dark.

Yelloweye rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus, YR) are widely distributed across the northeastern Pacific Ocean, inhabiting coastal rocky reefs from the Aleutian Islands in Alaska through southern California. This species exhibits an extended pelagic larval duration and has the capacity for long distance larval transport. We assayed 2,862 YR individuals from 13 general areas in the northeast Pacific Ocean for allelic variation at nine microsatellite loci. Bayesian model-based clustering analyses grouped individuals from the Strait of Georgia (SG) into a distinct genetic cluster, while individuals from outer coastal water locations (OCLs) were partitioned equally across two genetic clusters, including the cluster associated with the SG fish. Pairwise F-ST values were consistently an order of magnitude higher for comparisons between the SG and OCLs than they were for all OCL-OCL comparisons (similar to 0.016 vs. similar to 0.001). This same pattern was observed across two time points when individuals were binned into an ""old"" and ""young"" group according to birth year (old: similar to 0.020 vs. 0.0003; young: similar to 0.020 vs. similar to 0.004). Additionally, mean allelic richness was markedly lower within the SG compared to the OCLs (8.00 vs. 10.54-11.77). These results indicate that the Strait of Georgia ""deep-basin"" estuary oceanographic domain acts as a dispersal barrier from the outer coastal waters via the Juan de Fuca Strait. Alternatively, selection against maladapted dispersers across this oceanographic transition may underlie the observed genetic differentiation between the Georgia basin and the outer coastal waters, and further work is needed to confirm the SG-OCL divide acts as a barrier to larval dispersal.","[Siegle, Matthew R.; Taylor, Eric B.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Siegle, Matthew R.; Taylor, Eric B.] Univ British Columbia, Beaty Biodivers Museum, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Miller, Kristi M.; Withler, Ruth E.; Yamanaka, K.

Although bleaching has been intensively studied in corals, little is known about the causes and consequences of bleaching in other tropical symbiotic organisms. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study used underwater visual surveys to investigate bleaching in the 10 species of anemones that host anemonefishes. Bleaching was confirmed in seven anemone species (with anecdotal reports of bleaching in the other three species) at 10 of 19 survey locations spanning the Indo-Pacific and Red Sea, indicating that anemone bleaching is taxonomically and geographically widespread. In total, bleaching was observed in 490 of the 13,896 surveyed anemones (3.5%); however, this percentage was much higher (19-100%) during five major bleaching events that were associated with periods of elevated water temperatures and coral bleaching. There was considerable spatial variation in anemone bleaching during most of these events, suggesting that certain sites and deeper waters might act as refuges. Susceptibility to bleaching varied between species, and in some species, bleaching caused reductions in size and abundance. Conclusions/Significance: Anemones are long-lived with low natural mortality, which makes them particularly vulnerable to predicted increases in severity and frequency of bleaching events. Population viability will be severely compromised if anemones and their symbionts cannot acclimate or adapt to rising sea temperatures. Anemone bleaching also has negative effects to other species, particularly those that have an obligate relationship with anemones. These effects include reductions in abundance and reproductive output of anemonefishes. Therefore, the future of these iconic and commercially valuable coral reef fishes is inextricably linked to the ability of host anemones to cope with rising sea temperatures associated with climate change.","[Hobbs, Jean-Paul A.; Ford, Benjamin M.; Thums, Michele] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Inst, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Hobbs, Jean-Paul A.; Ford, Benjamin M.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Hobbs, Jean-Paul A.; Thums, Michele] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Oceans Inst, Perth, WA, Australia; [Frisch, Ashley J.] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Thums, Michele] Univ Western Australia, Sch Environm Syst Engn, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Thums, Michele] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Inst, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Saenz-Agudelo, Pablo; Berumen, Michael L.] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; [Berumen, Michael L.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Div Marine Biol Res, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",23,10.1371/journal.pone.0070966,2013

The swim paths were analyzed for swim duration, distance and speed, stop duration, and horizontal and vertical turn angles to determine whether elevated seawater pCO(2)-at beyond near-future ocean acidification levels-affects the swimming kinematics of Atlantic cod larvae. There were no significant differences in most of the variables tested: the swimming kinematics of Atlantic cod larvae at 12 and 27 dph were highly resilient to extremely elevated pCO(2) levels. Nonetheless, cod larvae cultured at the highest pCO(2) concentration displayed vertical turn angles that were more restricted (median turn angle, 15A degrees) than larvae in the control (19A degrees) and medium (19A degrees) treatments at 12 dph (but not at 27 dph). Significant reduction in the stop duration of cod larvae from the high treatment (median stop duration, 0.28 s) was also observed compared to the larvae from the control group (0.32 s) at 27 dph (but not at 12 dph). The functional and ecological significance of these subtle differences are unclear and, therefore, require further investigation in order to determine whether they are ecologically relevant or spurious.","[Maneja, R.

Juvenile coral trout reared for 4 weeks at 570 mu atm CO2 exhibited similar sensory responses and behaviors to juveniles reared at 490 mu atm CO2 (control). In contrast, juveniles reared at 700 and 960 mu atm CO2 exhibited dramatically altered sensory function and behaviors. At these higher CO2 concentrations, juveniles became attracted to the odor of potential predators, as has been observed in other reef fishes. They were more active, spent less time in shelter, ventured further from shelter, and were bolder than fish reared at 490 or 570 mu atm CO2. These results demonstrate that behavioral impairment of coral trout is unlikely if pCO(2) remains below 600 mu atm; however, at higher levels, there are significant impacts on juvenile performance that are likely to affect survival and energy budgets, with consequences for predator-prey interactions and commercial fisheries.","[Munday, Philip L.; Pratchett, Morgan S.; Dixson, Danielle L.; Donelson, Jennifer M.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Munday, Philip L.; Dixson, Danielle L.; Donelson, Jennifer M.; Endo, Geoff G.

However, susceptibility to bleaching varies greatly among coral genera and there are likely to be major changes in the relative abundance of different corals, even if the wholesale loss of corals does not occur for several decades. Here we document variation in bleaching susceptibility among key genera of reef-building corals in Moorea, French Polynesia, and compare bleaching incidence during mass-bleaching events documented in 1991, 1994, 2002 and 2007. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study compared the proportion of colonies that bleached for four major genera of reef-building corals (Acropora, Montipora, Pocillopora and Porites), during each of four well-documented bleaching events from 1991 to 2007. Acropora and Montipora consistently bleached in far greater proportions (up to 98%) than Pocillopora and Porites. However, there was an apparent and sustained decline in the proportion of colonies that bleached during successive bleaching events, especially for Acropora and Montipora. In 2007, only 77% of Acropora colonies bleached compared with 98% in 1991. Temporal variation in the proportion of coral colonies bleached may be attributable to differences in environmental conditions among years. Alternately, the sustained declines in bleaching incidence among highly susceptible corals may be indicative of acclimation or adaptation. Conclusions/Significance: Coral genera that are highly susceptible to coral bleaching, and especially Acropora and Montipora, exhibit temporal declines in their susceptibility to thermal anomalies at Moorea, French Polynesia. One possible explanation for these findings is that gradual removal of highly susceptible genotypes (through selective mortality of individuals, populations, and/or species) is producing a coral assemblage that is more resistant to sustained and ongoing ocean warming.","[Pratchett, Morgan S.; McCowan, Dominique] James Cook Univ North Queensland, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Maynard, Jeffrey A.] CRIOBE, Lab Excellence CORAIL USR CNRS EPHE 3278, Papetoai, Moorea, Fr Polynesia; [Maynard, Jeffrey A.] CREST Res Pk UNCW, Ctr Marine Sci, Wilmington, NC USA; [Heron, Scott F.] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm Coral Reef Watch, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Heron, Scott F.] James Cook Univ, Marine Geophys Lab, Sch Engn & Phys Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",40,10.1371/journal.pone.0070443,2013

In order to help maximize their utility, further information is needed to drive the design of stimulating resources for scuba divers. We used a questionnaire survey to explore divers' perceptions of artificial reefs in Barbados. In addition, we examined reef resource substitution behaviour among scuba divers. Divers expressed a clear preference for large shipwrecks or sunken vessels that provided a themed diving experience. Motives for diving on artificial reefs were varied, but were dominated by the chance of viewing concentrated marine life, increased photographic opportunities, and the guarantee of a 'good dive'. Satisfaction with artificial reef diving was high amongst novices and declined with increasing experience. Experienced divers had an overwhelming preference for natural reefs. As a management strategy, our results emphasize the capacity of well designed artificial reefs to contribute towards the management of coral reef diving sites and highlight a number of important areas for future research. Suggested work should validate the present findings in different marine tourism settings and ascertain support of artificial reefs in relationship to level of diver specialization.","[Kirkbride-Smith, Anne E.; Wheeler, Philip M.; Johnson, Magnus L.] Univ Hull, Ctr Environm & Marine Sci, Scarborough, N Yorkshire, England",18,10.1371/journal.pone.0068899,2013

Many variations of novel-object or novel-environment tests have been used to quantify the boldness of animals, although the relationship between test outcomes has rarely been investigated. Furthermore, the relationship of outcomes to any ecological aspect of fitness is generally assumed, rather than measured directly. Our study is the first to compare how the outcomes of the same test of boldness differ among observers and how different tests of boldness relate to the survival of individuals in the field. Newly-metamorphosed lemon damselfish, Pomacentrus moluccensis, were placed onto replicate patches of natural habitat. Individual behavior was quantified using four tests (composed of a total of 12 different measures of behavior): latency to enter a novel environment, activity in a novel environment, and reactions to threatening and benign novel objects. After behavior was quantified, survival was monitored for two days during which time fish were exposed to natural predators. Variation among observers was low for most of the 12 measures, except distance moved and the threat test (reaction to probe thrust), which displayed unacceptable amounts of inter-observer variation. Overall, the results of the behavioral tests suggested that novel environment and novel object tests quantified similar behaviors, yet these behavioral measures were not interchangeable. Multiple measures of behavior within the context of novel environment or object tests were the most robust way to assess boldness and these measures have a complex relationship with survivorship of young fish in the field. Body size and distance ventured from shelter were the only variables that had a direct and positive relationship with survival.","[White, James R.; McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Meekan, Mark G.] Univ Western Australia, Australian Inst Marine Sci, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Ferrari, Maud C.

We examined whether biotic resistance by native predators on Caribbean coral reefs has influenced the invasion success of red lionfishes (Pterois volitans and Pterois miles), piscivores from the Indo-Pacific. Specifically, we surveyed the abundance (density and biomass) of lionfish and native predatory fishes that could interact with lionfish (either through predation or competition) on 71 reefs in three biogeographic regions of the Caribbean. We recorded protection status of the reefs, and abiotic variables including depth, habitat type, and wind/wave exposure at each site. We found no relationship between the density or biomass of lionfish and that of native predators. However, lionfish densities were significantly lower on windward sites, potentially because of habitat preferences, and in marine protected areas, most likely because of ongoing removal efforts by reserve managers. Our results suggest that interactions with native predators do not influence the colonization or post-establishment population density of invasive lionfish on Caribbean reefs.","[Hackerott, Serena; Valdivia, Abel; Cox, Courtney E.; Bruno, John F.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Green, Stephanie J.; Cote, Isabelle M.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Akins, Lad] REEF, Key Largo, FL USA; [Layman, Craig A.] Florida Int Univ, Marine Sci Program, North Miami, FL USA; [Precht, William F.] NOAA Florida Keys Natl Marine Sanctuary, Key Largo, FL USA",65,10.1371/journal.pone.0068259,2013

However, current methods to assess nutrient limitation are often cumbersome and time consuming. For phytoplankton, a rapid method has been described based on short-term changes in chlorophyll fluorescence upon nutrient addition, also known as Nutrient-Induced Fluorescence Transients (NIFTs). Thus far, though, the NIFT technique was not well suited for macroalgae and seagrasses. Methodology & Principal Findings: We developed a new experimental setup so that the NIFT technique can be used to assess nutrient limitation of benthic macroalgae and seagrasses. We first tested the applicability of the technique on sea lettuce (Ulva lactuca) cultured in the laboratory on nutrient-enriched medium without either nitrogen or phosphorus. Addition of the limiting nutrient resulted in a characteristic change in the fluorescence signal, whereas addition of non-limiting nutrients did not yield a response. Next, we applied the NIFT technique to field samples of the encrusting fan-leaf alga Lobophora variegata, one of the key algal species often involved in the degradation of coral reef ecosystems. The results pointed at co-limitation of L. variegata by phosphorus and nitrogen, although it responded more strongly to phosphate than to nitrate and ammonium addition. For turtle grass (Thalassia testudinum) we found the opposite result, with a stronger NIFT response to nitrate and ammonium than to phosphate. Conclusions & Significance: Our extension of the NIFT technique offers an easy and fast method (30-60 min per sample) to determine nutrient limitation of macroalgae and seagrasses. We successfully applied this technique to macroalgae on coral reef ecosystems and to seagrass in a tropical inner bay, and foresee wider application to other aquatic plants, and to other marine and freshwater ecosystems.","[den Haan, Joost; Huisman, Jef; Dekker, Friso; Ford, Amanda K.; Vermeij, Mark J.

The genetic variability of Symbiodinium may contribute to the tolerance of the symbiotic association to elevated sea surface temperatures (SST). To assess the importance of factors such as the local environment, host identity and biogeography in driving Symbiodinium distributions on reef-wide scales, data from studies on reef invertebrate-Symbiodinium associations from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) were compiled. Methodology/Principal Findings: The resulting database consisted of 3717 entries from 26 studies. It was used to explore ecological patterns such as host-specificity and environmental drivers structuring community complexity using a multi-scalar approach. The data was analyzed in several ways: (i) frequently sampled host species were analyzed independently to investigate the influence of the environment on symbiont distributions, thereby excluding the influence of host specificity, (ii) host species distributions across sites were added as an environmental variable to determine the contribution of host identity on symbiont distribution, and (iii) data were pooled based on clade (broad genetic groups dividing the genus Symbiodinium) to investigate factors driving Symbiodinium distributions using lower taxonomic resolution. The results indicated that host species identity plays a dominant role in determining the distribution of Symbiodinium and environmental variables shape distributions on a host species-specific level. SST derived variables (especially SSTstdev) most often contributed to the selection of the best model. Clade level comparisons decreased the power of the predictive model indicating that it fails to incorporate the main drivers behind Symbiodinium distributions. Conclusions/Significance: Including the influence of different host species on Symbiodinium distributional patterns improves our understanding of the drivers behind the complexity of Symbiodinium-invertebrate symbioses. This will increase our ability to generate realistic models estimating the risk reefs are exposed to and their resilience in response to a changing climate.","[Tonk, Linda; Sampayo, Eugenia M.; Hoegh-Guldberg, Ove] Univ Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Tonk, Linda; Sampayo, Eugenia M.; Hoegh-Guldberg, Ove] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Weeks, Scarla; Magno-Canto, Marites] Univ Queensland, Biophys Oceanog Grp, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Tonk, Linda; Hoegh-Guldberg, Ove] Univ Queensland, Global Change Inst, St Lucia, Qld, Australia",22,10.1371/journal.pone.0068533,2013

We employed two sampling methods to quantify gnathiid activity: (1) Emergence traps set on reefs over a 24 h period; and (2) live fish placed in cages on reefs and retrieved during night and dawn peaks in gnathiid activity. These were compared during discrete phases as well as a continuous metric, the lunar ""angle"", and an estimate of ambient light availability (luminance). Lunar phase and angle varied in their statistical effect on gnathiid activity patterns by sampling method and/or year.

Retention or recruitment to natal reefs requires orientation capabilities that enable larvae to find their way. Although olfactory and acoustically based orientation has been implicated in homing when larvae are in the reef's vicinity, it is still unclear how they cope with greater distances. Here we show evidence for a sun compass mechanism that can bring the larvae to the vicinity of their natal reef. In a circular arena, pre-settlement larvae and early settlers (<24 hours) of the cardinal fish, Ostorhinchus doederleini, showed a strong SSE directional swimming response, which most likely has evolved to compensate for the locally prevailing large scale NNW current drift. When fish were clock-shifted 6 hours, they changed their orientation by ca. 180 degrees as predicted by the tropical sun curve at One Tree Island, i.e. they used a time-compensated sun compass. Furthermore, the fish oriented most consistently at times of the day when the sun azimuth is easy to determine. Microsatellite markers showed that the larvae that had just arrived at One Tree Island genetically belonged to either the local reef population or to Fitzroy Reef located 12 kilometers to the SSE. The use of a sun compass adds a missing long-distance link to the hierarchy of other sensory abilities that can direct larvae to the region of origin, including their natal reef. Predominant local recruitment, in turn, can contribute to genetic isolation and potential speciation.","[Mouritsen, Henrik; Gerlach, Gabriele] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Biol & Umweltwissensch, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; [Mouritsen, Henrik] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Forschungszentrum Neurosensor, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; [Atema, Jelle] Boston Univ, Marine Program, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Kingsford, Michael J.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Kingsford, Michael J.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",32,10.1371/journal.pone.0066039,2013

The red lionfish (Pterois volitans) is an invasive predatory marine fish that is undergoing exponential population growth throughout the tropical western Atlantic. Invasive lionfish threaten coral-reef ecosystems, but there is currently no evidence of any natural population control. Therefore, a manipulative field experiment was conducted to test for density dependence in lionfish. Juvenile lionfish densities were adjusted on small reefs and several demographic rates (growth, recruitment, immigration, and loss) were measured throughout an 8-week period. Invasive lionfish exhibited direct density dependence in individual growth rates, as lionfish grew slower at higher densities throughout the study. Individual growth in length declined linearly with increasing lionfish density, while growth in mass declined exponentially with increasing density. There was no evidence, however, for density dependence in recruitment, immigration, or loss (mortality plus emigration) of invasive lionfish. The observed density-dependent growth rates may have implications for which native species are susceptible to lionfish predation, as the size and type of prey that lionfish consume is directly related to their body size. The absence of density-dependent loss, however, contrasts with many native coral-reef fish species and suggests that for the foreseeable future manual removals may be the only effective local control of this invasion.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",24,10.1371/journal.pone.0066995,2013

The Central Red Sea is a highly under-investigated area, where healthy coral reefs are contending against intense coastal development. This in-situ study investigated both the independent and combined effects of manipulated inorganic nutrient enrichment (simulation of eutrophication) and herbivore exclosure (simulation of overfishing) on benthic algae development. Light-exposed and shaded terracotta tiles were positioned at an offshore patch reef close to Thuwal, Saudi Arabia and sampled over a period of 4 months. Findings revealed that nutrient enrichment alone affected neither algal dry mass nor algae-derived C or N production. In contrast, herbivore exclusion significantly increased algal dry mass up to 300-fold, and in conjunction with nutrient enrichment, this total increased to 500-fold. Though the increase in dry mass led to a 7 and 8-fold increase in organic C and N content, respectively, the algal C/N ratio (18 +/- 1) was significantly lowered in the combined treatment relative to controls (26 +/- 2). Furthermore, exclusion of herbivores significantly increased the relative abundance of filamentous algae on the light-exposed tiles and reduced crustose coralline algae and non-coralline red crusts on the shaded tiles. The combination of the herbivore exclusion and nutrient enrichment treatments pronounced these effects. The results of our study suggest that herbivore reduction, particularly when coupled with nutrient enrichment, favors non-calcifying, filamentous algae growth with high biomass production, which thoroughly outcompetes the encrusting (calcifying) algae that dominates in undisturbed conditions. These results suggest that the healthy reefs of the Central Red Sea may experience rapid shifts in benthic community composition with ensuing effects for biogeochemical cycles if anthropogenic impacts, particularly overfishing, are not controlled.","[Jessen, Christian; Wild, Christian] Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Ecol ZMT, Coral Reef Ecol Grp CORE, Bremen, Germany; [Roder, Cornelia; Lizcano, Javier Felipe Villa; Voolstra, Christian R.] KAUST, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; [Wild, Christian] Univ Bremen, Fac Biol & Chem, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",11,10.1371/journal.pone.0066992,2013

The second estimates reef fishers as a function of coral reef area, rural coastal population, and fishing pressure. In total, we find that there are 6 million reef fishers in 99 reef countries and territories worldwide, of which at least 25% are reef gleaners. Our estimates are an improvement over most existing fisher population statistics, which tend to omit accounting for gleaners and reef fishers. Our results suggest that slightly over a quarter of the world's small-scale fishers fish on coral reefs, and half of all coral reef fishers are in Southeast Asia. Coral reefs evidently support the socioeconomic well-being of numerous coastal communities. By quantifying the number of people who are employed as reef fishers, we provide decision-makers with an important input into planning for sustainable coral reef fisheries at the appropriate scale.","[Teh, Louise S.

While there is growing evidence from the Western Atlantic that mangrove habitats are intricately connected to coral reefs through ontogenetic fish migrations, there is an ongoing debate of the value of these coastal ecosystems in the Indo-Pacific. The present study used natural tags, viz. otolith stable carbon and oxygen isotopes, to investigate for the first time the degree to which multiple tropical juvenile habitats subsidize coral reef fish populations in the Indo Pacific (Tanzania). Otoliths of three reef fish species (Lethrinus harak, L. lentjan and Lutjanus fulviflamma) were collected in mangrove, seagrass and coral reef habitats and analyzed for stable isotope ratios in the juvenile and adult otolith zones. delta C-13 signatures were significantly depleted in the juvenile compared to the adult zones, indicative of different habitat use through ontogeny. Maximum likelihood analysis identified that 82% of adult reef L. harak had resided in either mangrove (29%) or seagrass (53%) or reef (18%) habitats as juveniles. Of adult L. fulviflamma caught from offshore reefs, 99% had passed through mangroves habitats as juveniles. In contrast, L. lentjan adults originated predominantly from coral reefs (65-72%) as opposed to inshore vegetated habitats (28-35%). This study presents conclusive evidence for a nursery role of Indo-Pacific mangrove habitats for reef fish populations. It shows that intertidal habitats that are only temporarily available can form an important juvenile habitat for some species, and that reef fish populations are often replenished by multiple coastal habitats. Maintaining connectivity between inshore vegetated habitats and coral reefs, and conserving habitat mosaics rather than single nursery habitats, is a major priority for the sustainability of various Indo Pacific fish populations.","[Kimirei, Ismael A.; Nagelkerken, Ivan; Huijbers, Chantal M.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Water & Wetland Res, Dept Anim Ecol & Ecophysiol, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Kimirei, Ismael A.] Tanzania Fisheries Res Inst, Kigoma, Tanzania; [Nagelkerken, Ivan] Univ Adelaide, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, So Seas Ecol Labs, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Mgaya, Yunus D.] Univ Dar Es Salaam, Dept Aquat Sci & Fisheries, Coll Nat & Appl Sci, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Huijbers, Chantal M.] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst Coasts & Estuaries, Southport, Qld 4215, Australia",37,10.1371/journal.pone.0066320,2013

Data on spatiotemporal changes in biodiversity during these modifications are important for decision support for coral reef biodiversity protection. The main objective of this study is to detect the spatiotemporal patterns of coral reef fish diversity during this transition using additive diversity-partitioning analysis. We examined alpha, beta and gamma fish diversity from 2000 to 2010, during which time a shift transition occurred at Mahahual Reef, located in Quintana Roo, Mexico. Data on coral reef fish and benthic communities were obtained from 12 transects per geomorphological unit (GU) in two GUs (reef slope and terrace) over six years (2000, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010). Spatial analysis within and between the GUs indicated that the gamma-diversity was primarily related to higher beta-diversity. Throughout the six study years, there were losses of alpha, beta and gamma-diversity associated spatially with the shallow (reef slope) and deeper (reef terrace) GUs and temporally with the transition in cover from mound corals to fleshy macroalgae and boulder corals. Despite a drastic reduction in the number of species over time, beta-diversity continues to be the highest component of gamma-diversity. The shift transition had a negative effect on alpha, beta and gamma-diversity, primarily by impacting rare species, leading a group of small and less vulnerable fish species to become common and an important group of rare species to become locally extinct. The maintenance of fish heterogeneity (beta-diversity) over time may imply the abetment of vulnerability in the face of local and global changes.","[Acosta-Gonzalez, Gilberto; Hernandez-Landa, Roberto C.; Arias-Gonzalez, Jesus E.] IPN, Unidad Merida, Ctr Invest & Estudios Avanzados, Lab Ecol Ecosistemas Arrecifes Coralinos, Merida, Yucatan, Mexico; [Rodriguez-Zaragoza, Fabian A.] Univ Guadalajara, CUCBA, Dept Ecol, LEMA, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico",19,10.1371/journal.pone.0065665,2013

The nitrogen fixation by sponge cyanobacteria was early observed. Until recently, sponges were found to be able to release nitrogen gas. However the gene-level evidence for the role of bacterial symbionts from different species sponges in nitrogen gas release is limited. And meanwhile, the quanitative analysis of nitrogen cycle-related genes of sponge microbial symbionts is relatively lacking. The nirK gene encoding nitrite reductase which catalyzes soluble nitrite into gas NO and nosZ gene encoding nitrous oxide reductase which catalyzes N2O into N-2 are two key functional genes in the complete denitrification pathway. In this study, using nirK and nosZ genes as markers, the potential of bacterial symbionts in six species of sponges in the release of N-2 was investigated by phylogenetic analysis and real-time qPCR. As a result, totally, 2 OTUs of nirK and 5 OTUs of nosZ genes were detected by gene library-based saturated sequencing. Difference phylogenetic diversity of nirK and nosZ genes were observed at OTU level in sponges. Meanwhile, real-time qPCR analysis showed that Xestospongia testudinaria had the highest abundance of nosZ gene, while Cinachyrella sp. had the greatest abundance of nirK gene. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the nirK and nosZ genes were probably of Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaproteobacteria origin. The results from this study suggest that the denitrification potential of bacteria varies among sponges because of the different phylogenetic diversity and relative abundance of nosZ and nirK genes in sponges. Totally, both the qualitative and quantitative analyses of nirK and nosZ genes indicated the different potential of sponge bacterial symbionts in the release of nitrogen gas.","[Zhang, Xia; He, Liming; Zhang, Fengli; Sun, Wei; Li, Zhiyong] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Marine Biotechnol Lab, State Key Lab Microbial Metab, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xia; He, Liming; Zhang, Fengli; Sun, Wei; Li, Zhiyong] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Life Sci & Biotechnol, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China",4,10.1371/journal.pone.0065142,2013

On coral reefs, recovery is largely dependent on coral reestablishment, and substratum stability is critical to the survival of coral fragments and recruits. Concrete is often used to immobilize rubble, but its ecological performance has not been rigorously evaluated, and restoration has generally fallen short of returning degraded habitat to pre-disturbance conditions. Fragments of erect branching sponges mediate reef recovery by facilitating rubble consolidation, yet such natural processes have been largely overlooked in restoring reefs. Methods: On two reefs in Curacao, four treatments - coral rubble alone, rubble seeded with sponge fragments, rubble bound by concrete, and concrete ""rubble'' bound by concrete - were monitored over four years to investigate rubble consolidation with and without sponges and the ecological performance of treatments in terms of the number and diversity of coral recruits. Species specific rates of sponge fragment attachment to rubble, donor sponge growth and tissue replacement, and fragment survival inside rubble piles were also investigated to evaluate sponge species performance and determine rates for sustainably harvesting tissue. Findings/Significance: Rubble piles seeded with sponges retained height and shape to a significantly greater degree, lost fewer replicates to water motion, and were significantly more likely to be consolidated over time than rubble alone. Significantly more corals recruited to sponge-seeded rubble than to all other treatments. Coral diversity was also greatest for rubble with sponges and it was the only treatment to which framework building corals recruited. Differences in overall sponge species performance suggest species selection is important to consider. Employing organisms that jump start successional pathways and facilitate recovery can significantly improve restoration outcomes; however, best practices require techniques be tailored to each system.","Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",10,10.1371/journal.pone.0064945,2013

Recently, surprising behavioural modifications has been detected in the early life stages of tropical coral reef fish exposed to ocean acidification-relevant CO2 concentrations, but it has been unclear if this effect could occur in temperate waters. Here we show several severe behavioural disturbances, including effects on boldness, exploratory behaviour, lateralisation, and learning in a temperate fish, the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). The behavioural effects were consistent throughout the exposure period and increased in effect size with exposure time. We observed the effects on adult sticklebacks, a species known to be tolerant to other environmental stressors. Our findings suggest that behavioural abnormalities that stem from CO2 exposure are not restricted to sensitive tropical species or early life stages and may therefore affect fish on a global scale. The severity of disturbances and the possibility of a serious behavioural problem for fish across the globe is cause for concern.","[Jutfelt, Fredrik; de Souza, Karine Bresolin; Vuylsteke, Amandine; Sturve, Joachim] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden",77,10.1371/journal.pone.0065825,2013

The aim of the study was to quantify microhabitat associations between juvenile and adult white-streaked grouper Epinephelus ongus, which supports important fisheries in coral reef areas. Underwater observations revealed that most juveniles were found in bottlebrush Acropora spp., staghorn Acropora spp. and coral rubble and there was a significant positive use of bottlebrush Acropora spp. and a significant negative use of coral rubble. For adults, most individuals were found in bottlebrush Acropora spp. and staghorn Acropora spp., and there was a significant positive use of staghorn Acropora spp. and significant negative use of coral rubble. A habitat choice experiment by using pre-settlement individuals revealed that both bottlebrush Acropora spp. and staghorn Acropora spp. were used as settlement sites, whereas coral rubble was rarely used as a settlement site. Results of the study suggest that juvenile and adult E. ongus showed significantly positive microhabitat associations with bottlebrush Acropora spp. and staghorn Acropora spp., respectively, in the field. Bottlebrush Acropora spp. has smaller inter-branch spaces than staghorn Acropora spp., which could drive patterns of microhabitat associations. In addition, post-settlement processes such as predation may influence the spatial distribution of juveniles. Because Acropora corals are very susceptible to coral bleaching, we predict that rising temperatures from climate change will negatively impact populations of E. ongus.","[Nanami, Atsushi; Sato, Taku; Takebe, Takayuki; Teruya, Kazuhisa] Fisheries Res Agcy, Res Ctr Subtrop Fisheries, Seikai Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Ishigaki, Okinawa 9070451, Japan; [Soyano, Kiyoshi] Nagasaki Univ, Inst East China Sea Res, Nagasaki 8512213, Japan",14,10.1007/s00227-013-2205-9,2013

We qualitatively and quantitatively (where sufficient standardised data were available) assess the literature regarding the role of structural complexity in coral reef ecosystems. A rapidly increasing number of publications have studied the role of complexity in reef ecosystems over the past four decades, with a concomitant increase in the diversity of methods used to quantify structure. Quantitative analyses of existing data indicate a strong negative relationship between structural complexity and algal cover, which may reflect the important role complexity plays in enhancing herbivory by reef fishes. The cover of total live coral and branching coral was positively correlated with structural complexity. These habitat attributes may be creating much of the structure, resulting in a collinear relationship; however, there is also evidence of enhanced coral recovery from disturbances where structural complexity is high. Urchin densities were negatively correlated with structural complexity; a relationship that may be driven by urchins eroding reef structure or by their gregarious behaviour when in open space. There was a strong positive relationship between structural complexity and fish density and biomass, likely mediated through density-dependent competition and refuge from predation. More variable responses were found when assessing individual fish families, with all families examined displaying a positive relationship to structural complexity, but only half of these relationships were significant. Although only corroborated with qualitative data, structural complexity also seems to have a positive effect on two ecosystem services: tourism and shoreline protection. Clearly, structural complexity is an integral component of coral reef ecosystems, and it should be incorporated into monitoring programs and management objectives.","[Graham, N. A. J.; Nash, K.

We used otolith microchemistry of newly settled bicolor damselfish (Stegastes partitus) in the Mesoamerican Reef System (MRS), Western Caribbean, to investigate patterns of connectivity among populations over 2 years. First, we assessed spatial and temporal variability in trace elemental concentrations from the otolith edge to make a 'chemical map' of potential source reef(s) in the region. Significant otolith chemical differences were detected at three spatial scales (within-atoll, between-atolls, and region-wide), such that individuals were classified to locations with moderate (52 % jackknife classification) to high (99 %) accuracy. Most sites at Turneffe Atoll, Belize showed significant temporal variability in otolith concentrations on the scale of 1-2 months. Using a maximum likelihood approach, we estimated the natal source of larvae recruiting to reefs across the MRS by comparing 'natal' chemical signatures from the otolith of recruits to the 'chemical map' of potential source reef(s). Our results indicated that populations at both Turneffe Atoll and Banco Chinchorro supply a substantial amount of individuals to their own reefs (i.e., self-recruitment) and thus emphasize that marine conservation and management in the MRS region would benefit from localized management efforts as well as international cooperation.","[Chittaro, P.

Increased turbidity led to a nonlinear response in predation patterns. Predator-induced mortality was similar to 50 % in the control and low turbidity level, but exhibited a substantial increase in the medium level. In the highest turbidity level, predation rates declined to the level seen in the control. These results suggest an imbalance in how the predator and prey cope with turbidity.

To test this assumption, we quantified detection rates for invasive Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois volitans and P. miles), which are now a primary threat to coral reef conservation throughout the Caribbean. Estimates of lionfish population density and distribution, which are essential for managing the invasion, are currently obtained through standard UVCs. Using two conventional UVC methods, the belt transect and stationary visual census (SVC), we assessed how lionfish detection rates vary with lionfish body size and habitat complexity (measured as rugosity) on invaded continuous and patch reefs off Cape Eleuthera, the Bahamas. Belt transect and SVC surveys performed equally poorly, with both methods failing to detect the presence of lionfish in > 50 % of surveys where thorough, lionfish-focussed searches yielded one or more individuals. Conventional methods underestimated lionfish biomass by similar to 200 %. Crucially, detection rate varied significantly with both lionfish size and reef rugosity, indicating that the application of a single correction factor across habitats and stages of invasion is unlikely to accurately characterize local populations. Applying variable correction factors that account for site-specific lionfish size and rugosity to conventional survey data increased estimates of lionfish biomass, but these remained significantly lower than actual biomass. To increase the accuracy and reliability of estimates of lionfish density and distribution, monitoring programs should use detailed area searches rather than standard visual survey methods. Our study highlights the importance of accounting for sources of spatial and temporal variation in detection to increase the accuracy of survey data from coral reef systems.","[Green, S.

We used stable isotope analysis (delta C-13, delta N-15) to investigate size-related ontogenetic dietary changes in multiple species of parrotfish on coral reefs around Zanzibar. We compared signatures among species and functional groups (scrapers, excavators and browsers) as well as ontogenetic stages (immature, initial and terminal phase) within species. Stable isotope analysis suggests that ontogenetic dietary shifts occurred in seven of the nine species examined; larger individuals had enriched delta C-13 values, with no relationship between size and delta N-15. The relationship between fish length and delta C-13 signature was maintained when species were categorised as scrapers and excavators, but was more pronounced for scrapers than excavators, indicating stronger ontogenetic changes. Isotopic mixing models classified the initial phase of both the most abundant excavator (Chlorurus sordidus) as a scraper and the immature stage of the scraper Scarus ghobban (the largest species) as an excavator, indicating that diet relates to size rather than taxonomy. The results indicate that parrotfish may show similar intra-group changes in diet with length, but that their trophic ecology is more complex than suggested by morphology alone.

This paper reports on coral bleaching and diseases in Rocas Atoll and Fernando de Noronha archipelago and examines their relationship with sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies recorded by PIRATA buoys located at 8A degrees S30A degrees W, 0A degrees S35A degrees W, and 0A degrees S23A degrees W. Adjusted satellite data were used to derive SST climatological means at buoy sites and to derive anomalies at reef sites. The whole region was affected by the elevated temperature anomaly that persisted through 2010, reaching 1.67 A degrees C above average at reef sites and 1.83 A degrees C above average at buoys sites. A significant positive relationship was found between the percentage of coral bleaching that was observed on reef formations and the corresponding HotSpot SST anomaly recorded by both satellite and buoys. These results indicate that the warming observed in the ocean waters was followed by a warming at the reefs. The percentage of bleached corals persisting after the subsidence of the thermal stress, and disease prevalence increased through 2010, after two periods of thermal stress. The in situ temperature anomaly observed during the 2009-2010 El Nio event was equivalent to the anomaly observed during the 1997-1998 El Nio event, explaining similar bleaching intensity. Continued monitoring efforts are necessary to further assess the relationship between bleaching severity and PIRATA SST anomalies and improve the use of this new dataset in future regional bleaching predictions.","[Ferreira, B.

Spatial patterns in herbivory-particularly along the depth gradient-influence the distribution and abundance of algae. Depth gradients in herbivorous reef fishes are generally assumed to be temporally stable, but this assumption has rarely been questioned. Here, we use underwater visual census and herbivore exclusion experiments to study the community composition and temporal patterns in habitat use by roving herbivorous fishes in an environment characterized by profound seasonal changes in algal biomass and distribution and extreme summer temperatures. Among the 18 species of roving herbivores recorded, parrotfishes were dominant in species richness and biomass, while regional endemic species represented 77 % of the total biomass. During most of the year, roving herbivores aggregate in the shallow reef zones and their biomass declines with depth. The herbivore community on the reef flat is distinct from that in deeper zones. The former is characterized by Siganus rivulatus, Acanthurus gahhm and Hipposcarus harid, while the deeper reef zones are characterized by S. ferrugineus, Chlorurus sordidus and Ctenochaetus striatus. In summer, the distinct community structures among reef zones are lost as reef flat herbivores tend to exploit deeper reef zones and some reef crest species venture on to the reef flat. This summer change in herbivore distribution is also reflected in reduced turf biomass and increased yield to herbivores in the deeper reef zones. Habitat use is related to the feeding mode such that browsers dominate the reef flat and scrapers the reef crest, while the seasonal changes correspond to changes in availability of targeted algal resources. These seasonal changes appear to be driven by the extreme temperatures in summer, reaching 36 A degrees C on the shallow reef flat.","[Afeworki, Y.; Videler, J.

Our data on sea snakes reveal an alternative mechanism for intraspecific niche partitioning, based on sex-specific seasonal anorexia induced by reproductive activities. Turtle-headed sea snakes (Emydocephalus annulatus) on coral reefs in the New Caledonian Lagoon feed entirely on the eggs of demersal-spawning fishes. DNA sequence data (cytochrome b gene) on eggs that we palpated from stomachs of 37 snakes showed that despite this ontogenetic stage specialization, the prey comes from a taxonomically diverse array of species including damselfish (41 % of samples, at least 5 species), blennies (41 %, 4 species) and gobies (19 %, 5 species). The composition of snake diets shifted seasonally (with damselfish dominating in winter but not summer), presumably reflecting seasonality of fish reproduction. That seasonal shift affects male and female snakes differently, because reproduction is incompatible with foraging. Adult female sea snakes ceased feeding when they became heavily distended with developing embryos in late summer, and males ceased feeding while they were mate searching in winter. The sex divergence in foraging habits may be amplified by sexual size dimorphism; females grow larger than males, and larger snakes (of both sexes) feed more on damselfish (which often lay their eggs in exposed sites) than on blennies and gobies (whose eggs are hidden within narrow crevices). Specific features of reproductive biology of coral reef fish (seasonality and nest type) have generated intraspecific niche partitioning in these sea snakes, by mechanisms different from those that apply to terrestrial snakes.","[Goiran, C.] Univ Nouvelle Caledonie, Lab LIVE, Noumea 98851, New Caledonia; [Goiran, C.] Univ Nouvelle Caledonie, Lab Excellence CORAIL, Noumea 98851, New Caledonia; [Dubey, S.] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Shine, R.] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",10,10.1007/s00338-012-1008-7,2013

The Pacific reef exhibited clear biological patterns and high temporal variability, such as the onset of snapping shrimp noise at night, as well as a 400-Hz daytime band likely produced by damselfish. In contrast, the Caribbean reef had high sound levels in the lowest frequencies, but lacked clear temporal patterns.

In comparison, little is known of the interaction between benthic carnivores and the EAM, despite the abundance of Crustacea within the EAM. The trophic importance of the EAM to fishes was investigated in Pioneer Bay, Orpheus Island, Great Barrier Reef. Fish densities were quantified using visual and clove oil censuses, and gut content analyses conducted on abundant fish species. Crustaceans were found to be an important dietary category, contributing between 49.5 and 100 % of the gut contents, with harpacticoid copepods being the dominant component. Of the benthic carnivores, the goby Eviota zebrina was found to consume the most harpacticoids with a mean of 249 copepods m(-2) day(-1). This represents approximately 0.1 % of the available harpacticoid population in the EAM. In a striking comparison, herbivorous parrotfishes were estimated to consume over 12,000 harpacticoids m(-2) day(-1), over 27 times more than all benthic carnivores surveyed, representing approximately 5.3 % of the available harpacticoid copepod population each day. The high consumption of harpacticoid copepods by benthic carnivores and parrotfishes indicates that harpacticoids form an important trophic link between the EAM and higher trophic levels on coral reefs.","[Kramer, M.

The majority of the biomass estimates came directly from a large-scale visual survey program; therefore, data were collected in the same way for all three models, enhancing comparability. Model outputs-such as net system production, size structure of the community, total throughput, production, consumption, production-to-respiration ratio, and Finn's cycling index and mean path length-indicate that the systems around the unpopulated French Frigate Shoals and along the relatively lightly populated Kona Coast of Hawai'i Island are mature, stable systems with a high efficiency in recycling of biomass. In contrast, model results show that the reef system around the most populated island in the State of Hawai'i, O'ahu, is in a transitional state with reduced ecosystem resilience and appears to be shifting to an algal-dominated system. Evaluation of the candidate indicators for fishing pressure showed that indicators at the community level (e. g., total biomass, community size structure, trophic level of the community) were most robust (i.e., showed the clearest trend) and that multiple indicators are necessary to identify fishing perturbations. These indicators could be used as performance indicators when compared to a baseline for management purposes. This study shows that ecosystem models can be valuable tools in identification of the system state in terms of complexity, stability, and resilience and, therefore, can complement biological metrics currently used by monitoring programs as indicators for coral reef status. Moreover, ecosystem models can improve our understanding of a system's internal structure that can be used to support management in identification of approaches to reverse unfavorable states.","[Weijerman, Mariska] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Joint Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Weijerman, Mariska] Wageningen Univ, Wageningen Inst Environm & Climate Res, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Fulton, Elizabeth A.] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org Hobart, Div Marine Res, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Parrish, Frank A.] Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Protected Species Div, Honolulu, HI USA",17,10.1371/journal.pone.0063797,2013

The coastal ocean is expected to experience periods of even lower carbonate saturation state because of the inherent natural variability of coastal habitats. Thus, in order to accurately project the impact of OA on the coastal ocean, we must first understand its natural variability. The production of dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) by marine algae and the release of DMSP's breakdown product dimethylsulphide (DMS) are often related to environmental stress. This study investigated the spatiotemporal response of tropical macroalgae (Padina sp., Amphiroa sp. and Turbinaria sp.) and the overlying water column to natural changes in reefal carbonate chemistry. We compared macroalgal intracellular DMSP and water column DMSP+DMS concentrations between the environmentally stable reef crest and environmentally variable reef flat of the fringing Suleman Reef, Egypt, over 45-hour sampling periods. Similar diel patterns were observed throughout: maximum intracellular DMSP and water column DMS/P concentrations were observed at night, coinciding with the time of lowest carbonate saturation state. Spatially, water column DMS/P concentrations were highest over areas dominated by seagrass and macroalgae (dissolved DMS/P) and phytoplankton (particulate DMS/P) rather than corals. This research suggests that macroalgae may use DMSP to maintain metabolic function during periods of low carbonate saturation state. In the reef system, seagrass and macroalgae may be more important benthic producers of dissolved DMS/P than corals. An increase in DMS/P concentrations during periods of low carbonate saturation state may become ecologically important in the future under an OA regime, impacting larval settlement and increasing atmospheric emissions of DMS.","[Burdett, Heidi L.; Donohue, Penelope J.

In this study, we tested whether the presence of consumers (invertebrate mesograzers) influenced the interactive effects of ocean acidification and warming on benthic microalgae in a seagrass community mesocosm experiment. Net effects of acidification and warming on benthic microalgal biomass and production, as assessed by analysis of variance, were relatively weak regardless of grazer presence. However, partitioning these net effects into direct and indirect effects using structural equation modeling revealed several strong relationships. In the absence of grazers, benthic microalgae were negatively and indirectly affected by sediment-associated microalgal grazers and macroalgal shading, but directly and positively affected by acidification and warming. Combining indirect and direct effects yielded no or weak net effects. In the presence of grazers, almost all direct and indirect climate effects were nonsignificant. Our analyses highlight that (i) indirect effects of climate change may be at least as strong as direct effects, (ii) grazers are crucial in mediating these effects, and (iii) effects of ocean acidification may be apparent only through indirect effects and in combination with other variables (e. g., warming). These findings highlight the importance of experimental designs and statistical analyses that allow us to separate and quantify the direct and indirect effects of multiple climate variables on natural communities.","[Alsterberg, Christian; Eklof, Johan S.; Gamfeldt, Lars; Sundback, Kristina] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Havenhand, Jonathan N.] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Biol & Environm Sci Tjarno, S-45296 Stromstad, Sweden",84,10.1073/pnas.1303797110,2013

Yet, little is known about the effect of catastrophic storms on ecosystem processes. Specifically, herbivory is the main control mechanism of macrophyte communities in the Mediterranean, with two main key herbivores: the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus and the fish Sarpa salpa. Consequently, the effects of extreme storm events on these two herbivores (at the population level and on their behaviour) may be critical for the functioning of the ecosystem. With the aim of filling this gap, we took advantage of two parallel studies that were conducted before, during and after an unexpected catastrophic storm event. Specifically, fish and sea urchin abundance were assessed before and after the storm in monitored fixed areas (one site for sea urchin assessment and 3 sites for fish visual transects). Additionally, we investigated the behavioural response to the disturbance of S. salpa fishes that had been tagged with acoustic transmitters. Given their low mobility, sea urchins were severely affected by the storm (ca. 50% losses) with higher losses in those patches with a higher density of sea urchins. This may be due to a limited availability of refuges within each patch. In contrast, fish abundance was not affected, as fish were able to move to protected areas (i.e. deeper) as a result of the high mobility of this species. Our results highlight that catastrophic storms differentially affect the two dominant macroherbivores of rocky macroalgal and seagrass systems due to differences in mobility and escaping strategies. This study emphasises that under catastrophic disturbances, the presence of different responses among the key herbivores of the system may be critical for the maintenance of the herbivory function.","[Pages, Jordi F.; Gera, Alessandro; Farina, Simone; Garcia-Rubies, Antoni; Alcoverro, Teresa] Ctr Estudis Avancats Blanes CEAB CSIC, Blanes, Spain; [Romero, Javier; Hereu, Bernat] Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Ecol, Barcelona, Spain; [Alcoverro, Teresa] Nat Conservat Fdn, Mysore, Karnataka, India",6,10.1371/journal.pone.0062719,2013

More specifically, the study focuses on MPAs as a fisheries management tool and evaluates their current establishment and management system in the French Mediterranean as a case study for the region. A brief review of the experiences on fisheries and MPA management in the Philippines is also presented to obtain insights on bottom-up and collaborative management approaches. Finally, possible opportunities for adopting a more decentralized and coordinated approach in fisheries management within the French socio-political system, and possibly in the northwestern Mediterranean region, are discussed. These include the existence of fishing community organizations in the region, such as the prud'homies in France and cofradias in Spain, starting with management strategies that are simpler to enforce and more acceptable to direct users, e.g., fishery reserves, and exploring co-management arrangements to manage fisheries at ecologically meaningful but operationally manageable scales as has been proposed by some development organizations.

Harvesting reef fish for the global ornamental fish trade has provoked conflict since the late 1970s in the State of Hawaii. Two decades later the state of Hawaii established a network of marine protected areas (MPAs) on the west coast of the island of Hawaii (""West Hawaii"") to protect and enhance the fish resources and alleviate conflict between stakeholders, principally between commercial dive tour operators and aquarium fishers. The perceptions held by these stakeholders on West Hawaii and Maui were evaluated to understand how MPAs influenced conflict dimensions, as the former location had a well-established MPA network designed to alleviate conflict, while the latter did not. This was accomplished by analyzing the following questions: (1) perceptions about the effectiveness of MPAs to alleviate conflict and enhance reef fish; (2) perceived group encounters and threats to coral reefs; (3) willingness to encourage fishing; and (4) value orientations toward the aquarium fish trade. The results indicate the MPAs in West Hawaii were moderately effective for alleviating conflict, encounters between stakeholders occurred on both islands, dive operators strongly opposed commercial fishing and perceived aquarium fishing as a serious threat to the coral reef ecosystem, and polarized value orientations toward the aquarium fish trade confirms pervasive social values conflict. The conflict between these groups was also asymmetrical. MPAs are inadequate for resolving long term conflict between groups who hold highly dissimilar value orientations toward the use of marine resources. Future marine spatial planning and MPA setting processes should include stakeholder value and conflict assessments to avoid and manage tensions between competing user groups. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Cold-water corals were thought to be strongly affected by a decrease in ocean pH due to their abundance in deep and cold waters which, in contrast to tropical coral reef waters, will soon become corrosive to calcium carbonate. Calcification rates of two Mediterranean cold-water coral species, Lophelia pertusa and Madrepora oculata, were measured under variable partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) that ranged between 380 mu atm for present-day conditions and 930 matm for the end of the century. The present study addressed both short- and long-term responses by repeatedly determining calcification rates on the same specimens over a period of 9 months. Besides studying the direct, short-term response to elevated pCO(2) levels, the study aimed to elucidate the potential for acclimation of calcification of cold-water corals to ocean acidification. Net calcification of both species was unaffected by the levels of pCO(2) investigated and revealed no short-term shock and, therefore, no long-term acclimation in calcification to changes in the carbonate chemistry. There was an effect of time during repeated experiments with increasing net calcification rates for both species, however, as this pattern was found in all treatments, there is no indication that acclimation of calcification to ocean acidification occurred. The use of controls (initial and ambient net calcification rates) indicated that this increase was not caused by acclimation in calcification response to higher pCO(2). An extrapolation of these data suggests that calcification of these two cold-water corals will not be affected by the pCO(2) level projected at the end of the century.","[Maier, Cornelia; Schubert, Alexander; Sanchez, Maria M.

Whereas it is well known that ocean acidification will negatively affect a range of calcareous taxa, the study of fishes is more limited in both depth of understanding and diversity of study species. We used new 3D microcomputed tomography to conduct in situ analysis of the impact of ocean acidification on otolith (ear stone) size and density of larval cobia (Rachycentron canadum), a large, economically important, pantropical fish species that shares many life history traits with a diversity of high-value, tropical pelagic fishes. We show that 2,100 mu atm partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) significantly increased not only otolith size (up to 49% greater volume and 58% greater relative mass) but also otolith density (6% higher). Estimated relative mass in 800 mu atm pCO(2) treatments was 14% greater, and there was a similar but nonsignificant trend for otolith size. Using a modeling approach, we demonstrate that these changes could affect auditory sensitivity including a similar to 50% increase in hearing range at 2,100 mu atm pCO(2), which may alter the perception of auditory information by larval cobia in a high-CO2 ocean. Our results indicate that ocean acidification has a graded effect on cobia otoliths, with the potential to substantially influence the dispersal, survival, and recruitment of a pelagic fish species.

These are key benthic ecosystems, providing spawning and nursery areas as well as food to numerous commercially important species. In situ pCO(2), pH (total scale), salinity and PAR irradiance were measured with a continuous recording sensor package dropped in a shallow macrophyte meadow (Eckernforde bay, western Baltic Sea) during three different weeks in July (pCO(2) and PAR only), August and September 2011. The mean (+/- SD) pCO(2) in July was 3836117 mu atm. The mean (+/- SD) pCO(2) and pH(tot) in August were 239 +/- 20 mu atm and 8.22 +/- 0.1, respectively. The mean (+/- SD) pCO(2) and pH(tot) in September were 1082 +/- 711 mu atm and 7.83 +/- 0.40, respectively. Daily variations of pCO(2) due to photosynthesis and respiration (difference between daily maximum and minimum) were of the same order of magnitude: 281 +/- 88 mu atm, 219 +/- 89 mu atm and 1488 +/- 574 mu atm in July, August and September respectively. The observed variations of pCO(2) were explained through a statistical model considering wind direction and speed together with PAR irradiance. At a time scale of days to weeks, local upwelling of elevated pCO(2) water masses with offshore winds drives the variation. Within days, primary production is responsible. The results demonstrate the high variability of the carbonate system in nearshore macrophyte meadows depending on meteorology and biological activities. We highlight the need to incorporate these variations in future pCO(2) scenarios and experimental designs for nearshore habitats.","[Saderne, Vincent] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Benthic Ecol Grp, Kiel, Schleswig Holst, Germany; [Saderne, Vincent; Herman, Peter Maria Jozef] NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Yerseke, Zeeland, Netherlands; [Fietzek, Peer] CONTROS Syst & Solut GmbH, Kiel, Schleswig Holst, Germany",45,10.1371/journal.pone.0062689,2013

Yet, despite the many proposed explanations for this diversity in coloration, definitive tests of the role of ecological factors in shaping the evolution of particular colour pattern traits are absent. Patterns such as spots and eyespots (spots surrounded by concentric rings of contrasting colour) have often been assumed to function for predator defence by mimicking predators' enemies' eyes, deflecting attacks or intimidating predators, but the evolutionary processes underlying these functions have never been addressed. Striped body patterns have been suggested to serve for both social communication and predator defence, but the impact of ecological constraints remains unclear. We conducted the first comparative analysis of colour pattern diversity in butterflyfishes (Family: Chaetodontidae), fishes with conspicuous spots, eyespots and wide variation in coloration. Using a dated molecular phylogeny of 95 species (approx. 75% of the family), we tested whether spots and eyespots have evolved characteristics that are consistent with their proposed defensive function and whether the presence of spots and body stripes is linked with species' body length, dietary complexity, habitat diversity or social behaviour. Contrary to our expectations, spots and eyespots appeared relatively recently in butterflyfish evolution and are highly evolutionarily labile, suggesting that they are unlikely to have played an important part in the evolutionary history of the group. Striped body patterns showed correlated evolution with a number of ecological factors including habitat type, sociality and dietary complexity. Our findings question the prevailing view that eyespots are an evolutionary response to predation pressure, providing a valuable counter example to the role of these markings as revealed in other taxa.","[Kelley, Jennifer L.; Fitzpatrick, John L.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Anim Biol, Ctr Evolutionary Biol, Neuroecol Grp, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia; [Merilaita, Sami] Abo Akad Univ, Behav & Evolutionary Ecol Grp, Dept Biosci, FIN-20520 Turku, Finland",27,10.1098/rspb.2012.2730,2013

Environmental variability is a major determinant of reef ecosystem structure and function, including coral reef extent and growth rates, and the abundance, diversity, and morphology of reef organisms. Proper characterization of environmental forcings on coral reef ecosystems is critical if we are to understand the dynamics and implications of abiotic-biotic interactions on reef ecosystems. This study combines high-resolution bathymetric information with remotely sensed sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a and irradiance data, and modeled wave data to quantify environmental forcings on coral reefs. We present a methodological approach to develop spatially constrained, island-and atoll-scale metrics that quantify climatological range limits and anomalous environmental forcings across U. S. Pacific coral reef ecosystems. Our results indicate considerable spatial heterogeneity in climatological ranges and anomalies across 41 islands and atolls, with emergent spatial patterns specific to each environmental forcing. For example, wave energy was greatest at northern latitudes and generally decreased with latitude. In contrast, chlorophyll-a was greatest at reef ecosystems proximate to the equator and northern-most locations, showing little synchrony with latitude. In addition, we find that the reef ecosystems with the highest chlorophyll-a concentrations; Jarvis, Howland, Baker, Palmyra and Kingman are each uninhabited and are characterized by high hard coral cover and large numbers of predatory fishes. Finally, we find that scaling environmental data to the spatial footprint of individual islands and atolls is more likely to capture local environmental forcings, as chlorophyll-a concentrations decreased at relatively short distances (>7 km) from 85% of our study locations. These metrics will help identify reef ecosystems most exposed to environmental stress as well as systems that may be more resistant or resilient to future climate change.","[Gove, Jamison M.; Vetter, Oliver J.; Foley, David G.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Joint Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Gove, Jamison M.; Vetter, Oliver J.] NOAA, Coral Reef Ecosyst Div, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Honolulu, HI USA; [Williams, Gareth J.; Sandin, Stuart A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [McManus, Margaret A.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Honolulu, HI USA; [Heron, Scott F.] NOAA, Natl Environm & Satellite Data & Informat Serv, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Heron, Scott F.] James Cook Univ, Sch Engn & Phys Sci, Dept Phys, Marine Geophys Lab, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Foley, David G.] NOAA, Div Environm Res, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Pacific Grove, CA USA",45,10.1371/journal.pone.0061974,2013

We tagged 39 sharks (mostly adult females) of which 31 were detected regularly throughout the study. Sharks displayed strong inter-annual residency with greater attendance at monitored sites during summer than winter months. More individuals were detected during the day than at night. Mean depths of tagged sharks increased from 35 m in winter to 60 m in spring following an increase in water temperature at 60 m, with maximum mean depths attained when water temperatures at 60 m stabilised around 29 degrees C. Sharks descended to greater depths and used a wider range of depths around the time of the full moon. There were also crepuscular cycles in mean depth, with sharks moving into shallower waters at dawn and dusk each day. We suggest that daily, lunar and seasonal cycles in vertical movement and residency are strategies for optimising both energetic budgets and foraging behaviour. Cyclical patterns of movement in response to environmental variables might affect the susceptibility of reef sharks to fishing, a consideration that should be taken into account in the implementation of conservation strategies.","[Vianna, Gabriel M.

DNA amplification and sequencing techniques of gut and fecal contents are promising approaches, but their success largely depends on the ability to amplify the taxonomic array of prey consumed and then match prey amplicons with reference sequences. When little a priori information on diet is available or a generalist predator is targeted, versatile primer sets (also referred to as universal or general primers) as opposed to group- or species-specific primer sets are the most powerful to unveil the full range of prey consumed. However, versatile primers are likely to preferentially amplify the predominant, less degraded predator DNA if no manipulation is performed to exclude this confounding DNA template. In this study we compare two approaches that eliminate the confounding predator template: restriction digestion and the use of annealing blocking primers. First, we use a preliminary DNA barcode library provided by the Moorea BIOCODE project to 1) evaluate the cutting frequency of commercially available restriction enzymes and 2) design predator specific annealing blocking primers. We then compare the performance of the two predator removal strategies for the detection of prey templates using two versatile primer sets from the gut contents of two generalist coral reef fish species sampled in Moorea. Our study demonstrates that blocking primers should be preferentially used over restriction digestion for predator DNA removal as they recover greater prey diversity. We also emphasize that a combination of versatile primers may be required to best represent the breadth of a generalist's diet.","[Leray, Matthieu; Mills, Suzanne C.] Univ Perpignan, CBETM, USR CRIOBE CNRS EPHE 3278, Lab Excellence Corail, F-66025 Perpignan, France; [Leray, Matthieu; Agudelo, Natalia; Meyer, Christopher P.] Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Washington, DC 20560 USA",21,10.1371/journal.pone.0058076,2013

Management strategies aiming at preserving the exceptional ecological value of these reefs in the context of climate change are currently being considered. This study evaluates the appropriateness of an exclusive fishing ban of herbivorous fish as a strategy to enhance coral reef resilience to hurricanes and bleaching in the UNESCO-registered areas of New Caledonia. A two-phase approach was developed: 1) coral, macroalgal, and herbivorous fish communities were examined in four biotopes from 14 reefs submitted to different fishing pressures in New Caledonia, and 2) results from these analyses were challenged in the context of a global synthesis of the relationship between herbivorous fish protection, coral recovery and relative macroalgal development after hurricanes and bleaching. Analyses of New Caledonia data indicated that 1) current fishing pressure only slightly affected herbivorous fish communities in the country, and 2) coral and macroalgal covers remained unrelated, and macroalgal cover was not related to the biomass, density or diversity of macroalgae feeders, whatever the biotope or level of fishing pressure considered. At a global scale, we found no relationship between reef protection status, coral recovery and relative macroalgal development after major climatic events. These results suggest that an exclusive protection of herbivorous fish in New Caledonia is unlikely to improve coral reef resilience to large-scale climatic disturbances, especially in the lightly fished UNESCO-registered areas. More efforts towards the survey and regulation of major chronic stress factors such as mining are rather recommended. In the most heavily fished areas of the country, carnivorous fish and large targeted herbivores may however be monitored as part of a precautionary approach.","[Carassou, Laure; Guillemot, Nicolas] IRD, Res Unit Coreus 227, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Leopold, Marc] IRD, Vanuatu Fisheries Dept, Res Unit Coreus 227, Port Vila, Vanuatu; [Wantiez, Laurent] Univ New Caledonia, Res Unit LIVE EA4243, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Wantiez, Laurent] Aquarium Lagons, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Kulbicki, Michel] IRD, Lab Arago, Res Unit Coreus 227, Banyuls Sur Mer, France",22,10.1371/journal.pone.0060564,2013

Coral decline can be exacerbated by the effects of local stressors like turbidity, yet some reefs with a natural history of turbidity can support healthy and resilient coral communities. However, little is known about responses of coral communities to bleaching events on anthropogenically turbid reefs as a result of recent (post World War II) terrestrial runoff. Analysis of region-scale coral cover and species abundance at 17-20 sites on the turbid reefs of Okinawa Island (total of 79 species, 30 genera, and 13 families) from 1995 to 2009 indicates that coral cover decreased drastically, from 24.4% to 7.5% (1.1%/ year), subsequent to bleaching events in 1998 and 2001. This dramatic decrease in coral cover corresponded to the demise of Acropora species (e. g., A. digitifera) by 2009, when Acropora had mostly disappeared from turbid reefs on Okinawa Island. In contrast, Merulinidae species (e. g., Dipsastraea pallida/speciosa/favus) and Porites species (e. g., P. lutea/australiensis), which are characterized by tolerance to thermal stress, survived on turbid reefs of Okinawa Island throughout the period. Our results suggest that high turbidity, influenced by recent terrestrial runoff, could have caused a reduction in resilience of Acropora species to severe thermal stress events, because the corals could not have adapted to a relatively recent decline in water quality. The coral reef ecosystems of Okinawa Island will be severely impoverished if Acropora species fail to recover.","[Hongo, Chuki; Yamano, Hiroya] NIES, Ctr Environm Biol & Ecosyst Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan",26,10.1371/journal.pone.0060952,2013

Nine neutral loci revealed limited evidence of genetic structure, but one outlier locus (Pcan1-27) which may be under selection provided evidence of the discontinuity in central NZ. Whilst the limited multilocus evidence of structure is assumed to result from high levels of gene flow among populations of this continuously distributed species, assignment tests indicated high to very high mean levels of self-recruitment within the 14 populations and the north and south regions. The nine neutral loci were unable to provide further clarification as to the geographic location of the discontinuity, whereas the Pcan1-27 locus was particularly informative. These results highlight a tension between limited evidence of genetic structure and presumptive high gene flow among populations versus high levels of self-recruitment and pronounced structure depending on microsatellite loci and analyses in question.

In laboratory assays, the two species of gobies were exposed to predator visual cues (native Nassau grouper predator vs. invasive lionfish predator), damage-released chemical cues from gobies, and combinations of these, along with appropriate controls.

Assessing their actual efficiency is still a challenge in complex ecosystems such as coral reefs, where reserve effects are likely to be obscured by high levels of environmental variability. The goal of this study was to investigate the potential interference of small-scale habitat structure on the efficiency of reserves. The spatial distribution of widely harvested macroinvertebrates was surveyed in a large set of protected vs. unprotected stations from eleven reefs located in New Caledonia. Abundance, density and individual size data were collected along random, small-scale (20 x 1 m) transects. Fine habitat typology was derived with a quantitative photographic method using 17 local habitat variables. Marine reserves substantially augmented the local density, size structure and biomass of the target species. Density of Trochus niloticus and Tridacna maxima doubled globally inside the reserve network; average size was greater by 10 to 20% for T. niloticus. We demonstrated that the apparent success of protection could be obscured by marked variations in population structure occurring over short distances, resulting from small-scale heterogeneity in the reef habitat. The efficiency of reserves appeared to be modulated by the availability of suitable habitats at the decimetric scale (""microhabitats"") for the considered sessile/low-mobile macroinvertebrate species.

We used the non-invasive eddy correlation technique to examine respiration and photosynthesis rates, through O-2 fluxes, from reef crests and reef slopes in the Florida Keys, USA. We assessed how the photosynthesis and respiration of different reef habitats is controlled by light and hydrodynamics. Numerous fluxes (over a 0.25 h period) were as high as 4500 mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1), which can only be explained by efficient light utilization by the phototrophic community and the complex canopy structure of the reef, having a many-fold larger surface area than its horizontal projection. Over diel cycles, the reef crest was net autotrophic, whereas on the reef slope oxygen production and respiration were balanced. The autotrophic nature of the shallow reef crests implies that the export of organics is an important source of primary production for the larger area. Net oxygen production on the reef crest was proportional to the light intensity, up to 1750 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) an d decreased thereafter as respiration was stimulated by high current velocities coincident with peak light levels. Nighttime respiration rates were also stimulated by the current velocity, through enhanced ventilation of the porous framework of the reef. Respiration rates were the highest directly after sunset, and then decreased during the night suggesting that highly labile photosynthates produced during the day fueled early-night respiration. The reef framework was also important to the acquisition of nutrients as the ambient nitrogen stock in the water had sufficient capacity to support these high production rates across the entire reef width. These direct measurements of complex reefs systems yielded high metabolic rates and dynamics that can only be determined through in situ, high temporal resolution measurements.","[Long, Matthew H.; Berg, Peter; Zieman, Joseph C.] Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [de Beer, Dirk] Max Plank Inst Marine Microbiol, Bremen, Germany",39,10.1371/journal.pone.0058581,2013

However, it is unclear if increased mortality results from changes in the dynamics of predator-prey interactions or due to prey increasing activity levels. Here we demonstrate that ocean pCO(2) projected to occur by 2100 significantly effects the interactions of a predator-prey pair of common reef fish: the planktivorous damselfish Pomacentrus amboinensis and the piscivorous dottyback Pseudochromis fuscus. Prey exposed to elevated CO2 (880 mu atm) or a present-day control (440 matm) interacted with similarly exposed predators in a cross-factored design. Predators had the lowest capture success when exposed to elevated CO2 and interacting with prey exposed to present-day CO2. Prey exposed to elevated CO2 had reduced escape distances and longer reaction distances compared to prey exposed to present-day CO2 conditions, but this was dependent on whether the prey was paired with a CO2 exposed predator or not. This suggests that the dynamics of predator-prey interactions under future CO2 environments will depend on the extent to which the interacting species are affected and can adapt to the adverse effects of elevated CO2.","[Allan, Bridie J.

None of the temperature metrics commonly used to predict mass bleaching performed strongly when applied to these data.

These specialisations define how a species interacts with its environment and, by extension, determine its functional role. Here, we examine the feeding niche of three species of coral reef-dwelling rabbitfishes (Siganidae, Siganus). By comparing aspects of their feeding behaviour (bite location, bite rate, foraging distance) with that of representative species from two other abundant herbivorous fish families, the parrotfishes (Labridae, Scarus) and surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae, Acanthurus), we examine whether rabbitfishes have a feeding niche distinct from other members of the herbivore guild. Measurements of the penetration of the fishes' snouts and bodies into reef concavities when feeding revealed that rabbitfish fed to a greater degree from reef crevices and interstices than other herbivores. There was just a 40 % overlap in the penetration-depth niche between rabbitfish and surgeonfish and a 45 % overlap between rabbitfish and parrotfish, compared with the almost complete niche overlap (95 %) recorded for parrotfish and surgeonfish along this spatial niche axis. Aspects of the morphology of rabbitfish which may contribute to this niche segregation include a comparatively longer, narrower snout and narrower head. Our results suggest that sympatric coexistence of rabbitfish and other reef herbivores is facilitated by segregation along a spatial (and potentially dietary) axis. This segregation results in a unique functional role for rabbitfishes among roving herbivores that of ""crevice-browser"": a group that specifically feeds on crevice-dwelling algal or benthic organisms. This functional trait may have implications for reef ecosystem processes in terms of controlling the successional development of crevice-based algal communities, reducing their potential to trigger macroalgal outbreaks.","[Fox, R.

Whereas Paleozoic and Mesozoic reefs are commonly thought to reveal an autogenic primary-climax zonation, patterns in Neogene and Quaternary reefs are much more diverse. Here, we describe a well-preserved late Pleistocene coral reef from Dahab on Sinai Peninsula (Egypt), which shows a distinct zonation that resembles an ecological succession. In contrast to classical examples of ecological successions, species composition, paleoenvironmental conditions, and coral biodiversity of the Dahab reef indicate an allogenic, sea-level controlled community change, from marginal marine to reef slope and back reef. A review of the literature confirms that autogenic, short-term successions are virtually absent in Quaternary reefs. We predict that long generation times of corals make it unlikely that classical autogenic successions develop in reefs at all, unless environmental conditions are unusually stable.","[Mewis, H.; Kiessling, W.] Humboldt Univ, Museum Nat Kunde, Leibniz Inst Res Evolut & Biodivers, D-10115 Berlin, Germany",6,10.1007/s00338-012-0968-y,2013

Newly settled juveniles were reared for 4 months in four temperature treatments, consisting of the current-day summer average (28.5 A degrees C) and up to 3 A degrees C above the average (29.5, 30.5 and 31.5 A degrees C). Resting metabolic rate (RMR) of fish reared at 29.5 and 31.5 A degrees C was significantly higher than the control group reared at 28.5 A degrees C. In contrast, RMR of fish reared at 30.5 A degrees C was not significantly different from the control group, indicating these fish had acclimated to their rearing temperature. Furthermore, fish that developed in 30.5 and 31.5 A degrees C exhibited an enhanced ability to deal with acute temperature increases.

While this partnership is one of the keys to the success of coral reef ecosystems, surprisingly little is known about many aspects of coral symbiosis, in particular the establishment and development of symbiosis in host species that acquire symbionts anew in each generation. More specifically, the point at which symbiosis is established (i.e., larva vs. juvenile) remains uncertain, as does the source of free-living Symbiodinium in the environment. In addition, the capacity of host and symbiont to form novel combinations is unknown. To explore patterns of initial association between host and symbiont, larvae of two species of Acropora were exposed to sediment collected from three locations on the Great Barrier Reef. A high proportion of larvae established symbiosis shortly after contact with sediments, and Acropora larvae were promiscuous, taking up multiple types of Symbiodinium. The Symbiodinium types acquired from the sediments reflected the symbiont assemblage within a wide range of cnidarian hosts at each of the three sites, suggesting potential regional differences in the free-living Symbiodinium assemblage. Coral larvae clearly have the capacity to take up Symbiodinium prior to settlement, and sediment is a likely source. Promiscuous larvae allow species to associate with Symbiodinium appropriate for potentially novel environments that may be experienced following dispersal.","[Cumbo, V.

To better understand stresses generated by specific processes and events, many coral reef scientists seek to collect physical samples of settling particles and obtain reproducible information about net rates of sediment accumulation on coral reefs. Yet, the tools most commonly used to gather this information, sediment tube traps, only provide information on the gross accumulation of sediment at a site, in that all particles are effectively trapped within the container, unlike what a coral surface experiences. To address the need for an improved measurement of net particle accumulation on coral surfaces, we propose using recoverable sediment pods (SedPods) that can be constructed from readily available materials for under US $20. These devices are inexpensive, easy to fabricate, and allow for capture of particles over a given time span. The particles can then be used for laboratory analysis and accurate calculation of net accumulation rates on a coral surface proxy. In an experiment in Hanalei Bay, HI, we found that net sediment accumulation on rectangular SedPods was an order of magnitude less than gross accumulation in nearby conventional tube traps.","[Field, M.

However, the mechanical properties of reef substrate (i.e. the non-living benthos) are largely unknown, despite the fact that substrate properties may ultimately determine where organisms can persist. We used a geo-mechanical technique to measure substrate material density and strength over a reef hydrodynamic gradient. Contrary to expectation, we found a weak relationship between substrate strength and wave-induced water flow: flow rates decline sharply at the reef crest, whereas substrate properties are relatively constant over much of the reef before declining by almost an order of magnitude at the reef back. These gradients generate a novel hump-shaped pattern in resistance to mechanical disturbances for live corals, where colonies closer to the back reef are prone to dislodgement because of poorly cemented substrate. Our results help explain an intermediate zone of higher taxonomic and morphological diversity bounded by lower diversity exposed reef crest and unstable reef back zones.","[Madin, J. S.; Madin, E. M.

The CSD model could reproduce temporal variations in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity in coral zones, but not in seagrass meadows. The poor reproduction in seagrass meadows can be attributed to significant contributions of submarine groundwater discharge as well as misclassification of remotely sensed megabenthos in this area. In comparison with offshore areas, the reef acted as a CO2 sink during the observation period when it was averaged over 24 h. The CSD model also indicated large spatiotemporal differences in the carbon dioxide (CO2) sink/source, possibly related to hydrodynamic features such as effective offshore seawater exchange and neap/spring tidal variation. This suggests that the data obtained from a single point observation may lead to misinterpretation of the overall trend and thus should be carefully considered. The model analysis also showed that the advective flux of DIC from neighboring grids is several times greater than local biological flux of DIC and is three orders of magnitude greater than the air-sea gas flux at the coral zone.

Here, the performances of six proxy metrics are compared using regression analyses on survey data from a location in the northern Great Barrier Reef. Results suggest generic richness is a strong explanatory variable for spatial patterns in species richness (explaining 82 % of the variation when measured on a belt transect).

Exploiting site-based differences in wave energy impinging on reef habitats over calm and rough weather, we found many reef fishes changed their swimming behaviour alongside increases in wave-driven water motion. Most fishes tended to orient their bodies parallel to oncoming wave-driven flow and recruited additional stabilising fins during rough weather; such changes in swimming behaviour aid stability and minimise drag. However, not all species displayed such flexibility, with fishes possessing highly tapered pectoral fins and high levels of swimming performance continuing to successfully navigate reef habitats without significantly altering their swimming behaviour.

They also underpin ecosystem processes vital for the future ability of coral reefs to generate ecological goods and services. Identifying socio-economic drivers behind the exploitation of fish that uphold these key ecosystem processes and the scales at which they operate is therefore critical for successful management. This study addresses this issue by examining the reef-associated fish value chain in Zanzibar, and how it links to functional groups of fish and maturity stage of fish within these groups. Semi-structured interviews with 188 respondents (fishers, traders and hotel staff) involved in the fisheries and trade with reef-associated fish in Zanzibar and participatory observations were used. The trade with reef fish in Zanzibar is a complex structure involving many different agents and this study shows that these different agents exhibit differential ""preferences"" regarding fish functional groups and/or maturity stages within these groups. Consequently, both high and low trophic species, as well as small and large fishes are fished and sold, which leaves no refuge for the fish assemblage to escape fishing. When other market agents than fishers have so much influence and there are few alternative income generating activities, it is not possible to put all burden on fishers. Management measures that extend down the value chain to include all market agents as well as their links to ecosystem processes are thus likely to be needed to reach the target of sustainable fisheries.

This is especially apparent on coral reefs where individual coral colonies aggregate to give a reef its morphology, species zonation, and three dimensionality. Structural complexity is classically measured with a reef rugosity index, which is the ratio of a straight line transect to the distance a flexible chain of equal length travels when draped over the reef substrate; yet, other techniques from visual categories to remote sensing have been used to characterize structural complexity at scales from microhabitats to reefscapes. Reef-scale methods either lack quantitative precision or are too time consuming to be routinely practical, while remotely sensed indices are mismatched to the finer scale morphology of coral colonies and reef habitats. In this communication a new digital technique, Digital Reef Rugosity (DRR) is described which utilizes a self-contained water level gauge enabling a diver to quickly and accurately characterize rugosity with non-invasive millimeter scale measurements of coral reef surface height at decimeter intervals along meter scale transects. The precise measurements require very little post-processing and are easily imported into a spreadsheet for statistical analyses and modeling. To assess its applicability we investigated the relationship between DRR and fish community structure at four coral reef sites on Menjangan Island off the northwest corner of Bali, Indonesia and one on mainland Bali to the west of Menjangan Island; our findings show a positive relationship between DRR and fish diversity.

This pattern was supported by distributions of invertebrates and habitat-forming primary producers. Habitat availability, heterogeneity, and sea surface temperatures were highly correlated with species richness across spatial grains ranging from 23,000 to 5,100,000 km(2) with and without correction for autocorrelation. The consistent retention of habitat variables in our predictive models supports the area of refuge hypothesis which posits reduced extinction rates in the Coral Triangle. This does not preclude support for a center of origin hypothesis that suggests increased speciation in the region may contribute to species richness. In addition, consistent retention of sea surface temperatures in models suggests that available kinetic energy may also be an important factor in shaping patterns of marine species richness. Kinetic energy may hasten rates of both extinction and speciation. The position of the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool to the east of the Coral Triangle in central Oceania and a pattern of increasing species richness from this region into the central and northern parts of the Coral Triangle suggests peripheral speciation with enhanced survival in the cooler parts of the Coral Triangle that also have highly concentrated available habitat. These results indicate that conservation of habitat availability and heterogeneity is important to reduce extinction of marine species and that changes in sea surface temperatures may influence the evolutionary potential of the region.","[Sanciangco, Jonnell C.; Carpenter, Kent E.] Int Union Conservat Nat, Marine Biodivers Unit Global Marine Species Asses, Global Species Programme, Gland, Switzerland; [Sanciangco, Jonnell C.; Carpenter, Kent E.] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [Etnoyer, Peter J.] NOAA, Ctr Coastal Environm Hlth & Biomol Res, Charleston, SC USA; [Moretzsohn, Fabio] Texas A&M Univ, Harte Res Inst Gulf Mexico Studies, Corpus Christi, TX USA",29,10.1371/journal.pone.0056245,2013

Clearly, this raises the unresolved question of what functions do these markings have and do they contribute to an individual's evolutionary fitness in the wild. Here, we examined the occurrence of eyespots on the dorsal fin of a coral reef damselfish (Pomacentrus amboinensis), where these markings are typical of the juvenile stage and fade away as the fish approaches sexual maturation to then disappear completely in the vast majority of, but not all, adult individuals. By exploring differences in body shape among age and gender groups, we found that individuals retaining the eyespot into adulthood are all sexually mature males, suggesting that these eyespots may be an adult deceptive signal. Interestingly, the body shape of these individuals resembled more closely that of immature females than mature dominant males. These results suggest that eyespots have multiple roles and their functional significance changes within the lifetime of an animal from being a juvenile advertisement to a deceptive adult signal. Male removal experiments or colour manipulations may be necessary to establish specific functions.","[Gagliano, Monica] Univ Western Australia, Sch Anim Biol, Ctr Evolutionary Biol, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Gagliano, Monica] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Microscopy Characterisat & Anal, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Depczynski, Martial] Univ Western Australia, Australian Inst Marine Sci, Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA, Australia",5,10.1371/journal.pone.0055938,2013

Sponges are among the most diverse faunal groups in these ecosystems, and many of them host large abundances of microbes in their tissues. In this study, twelve sponge species from three cold-water coral reefs off Norway were investigated for the relationship between sponge phylogenetic classification (species and family level), as well as sponge type (high versus low microbial abundance), and the diversity of sponge-associated bacterial communities, taking also geographic location and water depth into account. Community analysis by Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (ARISA) showed that as many as 345 (79%) of the 437 different bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) detected in the dataset were shared between sponges and sediments, while only 70 (16%) appeared purely sponge-associated. Furthermore, changes in bacterial community structure were significantly related to sponge species (63% of explained community variation), sponge family (52%) or sponge type (30%), whereas mesoscale geographic distances and water depth showed comparatively small effects (< 5% each). In addition, a highly significant, positive relationship between bacterial community dissimilarity and sponge phylogenetic distance was observed within the ancient family of the Geodiidae. Overall, the high diversity of sponges in cold-water coral reefs, combined with the observed sponge-related variation in bacterial community structure, support the idea that sponges represent heterogeneous, yet structured microbial habitats that contribute significantly to enhancing bacterial diversity in deep-sea ecosystems.","[Schoettner, Sandra; Hoffmann, Friederike; Boetius, Antje; Ramette, Alban] Max Planck Inst Marine Microbiol, HGF MPG Grp Deep Sea Ecol & Technol, Bremen, Germany; [Schoettner, Sandra] Univ Bergen, Marine Microbiol Grp, Dept Biol, Bergen, Norway; [Hoffmann, Friederike; Rapp, Hans Tore] Univ Bergen, Dept Biol, Ctr Geobiol, Bergen, Norway; [Cardenas, Paco] Univ Bergen, Dept Biol, Bergen High Technol Ctr, Bergen, Norway",20,10.1371/journal.pone.0055505,2013

The first objective was more ambitious than the current Convention on Biological Diversity (Aichi) targets. We found that both objectives could not be achieved simultaneously and that large compromises are needed. Due to the small size of these islands, and the dependence of local communities on coral reef resources, the fishery objective significantly limited the extent of most habitats available for conservation. The problem is exacerbated if the conservation plan uses larger conservation units and more complex habitat typologies. Our results indicate that international conservation guidelines should be carefully adapted to small Pacific islands and that incentives to make feasible the necessary reductions in available fishing grounds will probably be needed.","[Hamel, Melanie A.; Andrefouet, Serge] Ctr Noumea, Inst Rech Dev, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia; [Hamel, Melanie A.; Pressey, Robert L.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",15,10.1111/j.1755-263X.2012.00285.x,2013

The terrigenous fraction in surface sediment increased with proximity to a clear source of sediment input. The percent cover of live coral, macroalgae, and turf algae decreased with higher terrigenous sediment fraction, while sponge cover increased.

I propose and assess such an alternative explanation. With mimicry the mimic resembles its model, evolved to do so in response to selection by the mimicry target, and gains evolved benefits from that resemblance. In the alternative, the social-trap hypothesis, a coincidental resemblance of the model to the ""mimic"" inadvertently attracts the latter to it, and reinforcement of this social trapping by learned benefits leads to the ""mimic"" regularly associating with the model. I examine three well known cases of supposed aggressive mimicry among reef-fishes in relation to nine predictions from these hypotheses, and assess which hypothesis offers a better explanation for each. One case, involving precise and complex morphological and behavioral resemblance, is strongly consistent with mimicry, one is inconclusive, and one is more consistent with a social-trap based on coincidental, imprecise resemblance. Few cases of supposed interspecific mimicry among tropical reef fishes have been examined in depth, and many such associations may involve social traps arising from generalized, coincidental resemblance. Mimicry may be much less common among these fishes than is generally thought.","Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama",11,10.1371/journal.pone.0054939,2013

Coral reef benthic assemblages of the region were monitored from 2003 to 2008. Two habitats (pinnacles' tops and walls) were sampled per site with 3-10 sites sampled within different reef areas. Different methodologies were applied in two distinct sampling periods: 2003-2005 and 2006-2008. Spatial coverage and taxonomic resolution were lower in the former than in the latter period. Benthic assemblages differed markedly in the smallest spatial scale, with greater differences recorded between habitats. Management regimes and biomass of fish functional groups (roving and territorial herbivores) had minor influences on benthic assemblages. These results suggest that local environmental factors such as light, depth and substrate inclination exert a stronger influence on the structure of benthic assemblages than protection from fishing. Reef walls of unprotected coastal reefs showed highest coral cover values, with a major contribution of Montastraea cavernosa (a sediment resistant species that may benefit from low light levels). An overall negative relationship between fleshy macroalgae and slow-growing reef-building organisms (i.e. scleractinians and crustose calcareous algae) was recorded, suggesting competition between these organisms. The opposite trend (i.e. positive relationships) was recorded for turf algae and the two reef-building organisms, suggesting beneficial interactions and/or co-occurrence mediated by unexplored factors. Turf algae cover increased across the region between 2006 and 2008, while scleractinian cover showed no change. The need of a continued and standardized monitoring program, aimed at understanding drivers of change in community patterns, as well as to subsidize sound adaptive conservation and management measures, is highlighted.","[Francini-Filho, Ronaldo B.] Univ Fed Paraiba, Dept Engn & Meio Ambiente, Rio Tinto, Paraiba, Brazil; [Coni, Ericka O.

We evaluated the effects of short (2.5 month) and long (10 month) periods of FTA removal on tissue thickness (TT), zooxanthellae density (ZD), mitotic index (MI), and concentration of chlorophyll a (Chl a) in Montastraea annularis at the beginning and end of gametogenesis. Ramets (individual lobes within a colony) consistently surrounded by FTA and ramets surrounded by crustose coralline algae (CCA) were used as controls. FTA removal reduced coral stress, indicated by increased TT and ZD and lower MI. The measured effects were similar in magnitude for the short and long periods of algal removal. Ramets were more stressed at the end of gametogenesis compared with the beginning, with lower ZD and Chl a cm(-2), and higher MI. However, it was not possible to distinguish the stress caused by the presence of FTA from that caused by seasonal changes in seawater temperature. Ramets surrounded by CCA showed less stress in comparison with ramets surrounded by FTA: with higher TT, Chl a cm(-2) and ZD, and lower MI values. Coral responses indicated that ramets with FTA suffered the most deleterious effects and contrasted with those measured in ramets surrounded by CCA. According to published studies and our observations, there could be at least six mechanisms associated to FTA in the stress caused to M. annularis by FTA. Owing to the high cover of FTA (in contrast to macroalgae and CCA) in the Caribbean, the chronic stress, the overgrowth and mortality that this functional algal group can cause on M. annularis species complex, a further decline of this important reef-building coral in the Caribbean is expected.","[Cetz-Navarro, Neidy P.; Espinoza-Avalos, Julio; Hernandez-Arana, Hector A.] Colegio Frontera Sur, Chetmal, Quintana Roo, Mexico; [Carricart-Ganivet, Juan P.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Unidad Acad Sistemas Arrecifales, Puerto Morelos, Quintana Roo, Mexico",5,10.1371/journal.pone.0054810,2013

As temperatures increase, coral species and perhaps reefs may move into higher-latitude waters, increasing the chances of coral reef ecosystems surviving despite global warming. However, there is a growing need to understand the structure of these high-latitude coral communities in order to analyze their future dynamics and to detect any potential changes. Methodology/Principal Findings: The high-latitude (32.75 degrees N) community surveyed was located at Tatsukushi, Shikoku Island, Japan. Coral cover was 60 +/- 2% and was composed of 73 scleractinian species partitioned into 7 functional groups. Although only 6% of species belonged to the 'plate-like' functional group, it was the major contributor to species coverage. This was explained by the dominance of plate-like species such as Acropora hyacinthus and A. solitaryensis. Comparison with historical data suggests a relatively recent colonization/development of A. hyacinthus in this region and a potential increase in coral diversity over the last century. Low coverage of macroalgae (2% of the benthic cover) contrasted with the low abundance of herbivorous fishes, but may be reasonably explained by the high density of sea urchins (12.9 +/- 3.3 individuals m(-2)). Conclusions/Significance: The structure and composition of this benthic community are relatively remarkable for a site where winter temperature can durably fall below the accepted limit for coral reef development. Despite limited functionalities and functional redundancy, the current benthic structure might provide a base upon which a reef could eventually develop, as characterized by opportunistic and pioneer frame-building species. In addition to increasing seawater temperatures, on-going management actions and sea urchin density might also explain the observed state of this community. A focus on such 'marginal' communities should be a priority, as they can provide important insights into how tropical corals might cope with environmental changes.","[Denis, Vianney; Kuo, Chao-Yang; De Palmas, Stephane; Keshavmurthy, Shashank; Chen, Chaolun Allen] Acad Sinica, Biodivers Res Ctr, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Mezaki, Takuma; Tanaka, Kouki] Kuroshio Biol Res Fdn, Kochi, Japan; [Chen, Chaolun Allen] Acad Sinica, Taiwan Int Grad Program Biodivers, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Chen, Chaolun Allen] Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 10764, Taiwan",15,10.1371/journal.pone.0054330,2013

Here, we document mixed affects of MPA zoning on fish density, biomass and species richness over the 21 years since establishment of the Saba Marine Park (SMP). Although we found significantly greater biomass and species richness of reef-associated fishes within shallow habitats (5 meters depth) closed to fishing, this did not hold for deeper (15 m) habitats, and there was a widespread decline (38% decrease) in live hard coral cover and a 68% loss of carnivorous reef fishes across all zones of the SMP from the 1990s to 2008.

Simulations were used to explore the sensitivity of water column carbonate chemistry across the reef system to variations in benthic reef metabolism, wave forcing, sea level, and system geomorphology. Our results show that changes in reef-water carbonate chemistry depend primarily on the ratio of benthic metabolism to the square root of the onshore wave energy flux as well as on the length and depth of the reef flat; however, they are only weakly dependent on channel geometry and the total frictional resistance of the reef system. Diurnal variations in pCO(2), pH, and aragonite saturation state (Omega(ar)) are primarily dependent on changes in net production and are relatively insensitive to changes in net calcification; however, net changes in pCO(2), pH, and Omega(ar) are more strongly influenced by net calcification when averaged over 24 hours. We also demonstrate that a relatively simple one-dimensional analytical model can provide a good description of the functional dependence of reef-water carbonate chemistry on benthic metabolism, wave forcing, sea level, reef flat morphology, and total system frictional resistance. Importantly, our results indicate that any long-term (weeks to months) net offsets in reef-water pCO(2) relative to offshore values should be modest for reef systems with narrow and/or deep lagoons. Thus, the long-term evolution of water column pCO(2) in many reef environments remains intimately connected to the regional-scale oceanography of offshore waters and hence directly influenced by rapid anthropogenically driven increases in pCO(2).","[Falter, James L.; Lowe, Ryan J.; Zhang, Zhenlin; McCulloch, Malcolm] Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Environm, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Falter, James L.; Zhang, Zhenlin; McCulloch, Malcolm] Univ Western Australia, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Falter, James L.; Lowe, Ryan J.; Zhang, Zhenlin; McCulloch, Malcolm] Univ Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, Perth, WA 6009, Australia",52,10.1371/journal.pone.0053303,2013

Displaying an exceptional aerobic scope (22-fold above resting), streamlined rigid-body posture, and wing-like fins that generate lift-based thrust, S. bandanensis literally flies underwater to efficiently maintain high optimum swimming speeds. Extreme energetic performance may be key to the colonization of highly variable environments, such as the wave-swept habitats where S. bandanensis and other wing-finned species tend to occur.

Strong interactions among private (commercial fishing and other wage-employment), public (social security payments from the State) and subsistence sectors were observed. When social security payments were spent, Islanders were more reliant on subsistence fishing. Also, higher levels of involvement in the private sector corresponded with a shift from shore to boat-based subsistence activities.

Understanding perceptions is particularly important in the context of coral reefs because threats are often diverse and management options are numerous, and therefore perceptions are likely to be diverse. This study identified the dominant discourses of reef fish decline, and increase, among 119 fishers and fish traders (herein middlemen) in Solomon Islands, and compared these discourses to current scientific knowledge. Discourses were then explored for dominant themes that might improve understanding of resource user perceptions. The findings suggest that certain fisher and middlemen discourses align with scientific understanding of the causal links between human activity and fish stock declines, and that many of the elicited management strategies are aligned with current scientific recommendations. A theme that emerged across the fisher and middlemen discourses of fish decline was a dichotomy in perception between fishing for economic affluence and fishing for subsistence and economic survival. A theme that emerged across discourses of fish increase was a dichotomy between support for command-and-control approaches and support for community-based approaches to management. Differences between some fisher and middlemen discourses were explained by the location in which interviews were conducted suggesting consensual perceptions achieved through local knowledge networks. Similarity between scientific understanding and local perceptions suggests that local resource users are aware of, and might support, fishery management strategies based on scientific evidence. Such strategies must consider factors such as location because resource user perceptions differ between locations and because many threats to the fishery and preferred management strategies are likely to be context specific.

Temporal, non-permanent, rotational or periodically harvested area closures have been employed across the Indo:Pacific for centuries and are a common measure within contemporary community-based and co-management frameworks. Although prior evidence suggests that periodic closures may confer fisheries benefits for some taxa or in certain conditions, there is little evidence that they are equally effective for the sustainable management of the many types of small-scale fisheries important in the Indo-Pacific. Case studies of periodic closures are reviewed to highlight the variations in target species, harvesting periodicity and fishing pressure that will influence the fisheries management effectiveness of this tool. Fisheries management benefits are observed for short-lived, fast-growing taxa or for a range of taxa in low fishing pressure situations. Stocks declines are observed for long-lived taxa or for a range of taxa if harvesting is intense.

Little evidence is available about the so-called 'recruitment subsidy', the augmented production of propagules (i.e. eggs and larvae) due to the increased abundance of large-sized spawners hosted within effective MPAs. Once emitted, propagules can be locally retained and/or exported elsewhere. Patterns of propagule retention and/or export from MPAs have been little investigated, especially in the Mediterranean. This study investigated the potential for propagule production and retention/export from a Mediterranean MPA (Torre Guaceto, SW Adriatic Sea) using the white sea bream, Diplodus sargus sargus, as a model species. A multidisciplinary approach was used combining 1) spatial distribution patterns of individuals (post-settlers and adults) assessed through visual census within Torre Guaceto MPA and in northern and southern unprotected areas, 2) Lagrangian simulations of dispersal based on an oceanographic model of the region and data on early life-history traits of the species (spawning date, pelagic larval duration) and 3) a preliminary genetic study using microsatellite loci. Results show that the MPA hosts higher densities of larger-sized spawners than outside areas, potentially guaranteeing higher propagule production. Model simulations and field observation suggest that larval retention within and long-distance dispersal across MPA boundaries allow the replenishment of the MPA and of exploited populations up to 100 km down-current (southward) from the MPA. This pattern partially agrees with the high genetic homogeneity found in the entire study area (no differences in genetic composition and diversity indices), suggesting a high gene flow. By contributing to a better understanding of propagule dispersal patterns, these findings provide crucial information for the design of MPAs and MPA networks effective to replenish fish stocks and enhance fisheries in unprotected areas.","[Di Franco, Antonio; Guidetti, Paolo] Univ Salento, Lab Conservat & Management Marine & Coastal Resou, Dipartimento Sci & Tecnol Biol & Ambientali, Consorzio Nazl Interuniv Sci Mare, Lecce, Italy; [Di Franco, Antonio; Guidetti, Paolo] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, Lab ECOMERS, Fac Sci, Nice, France; [Coppini, Giovanni] Ist Nazl Geofis & Vulcanol, Bologna, Italy; [Pujolar, Jose Martin; Zane, Lorenzo] Univ Padua, Dept Biol, Padua, Italy; [De Leo, Giulio A.] Univ Parma, Dept Environm Sci, I-43100 Parma, Italy; [De Leo, Giulio A.] Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA; [Gatto, Marino; Melia, Paco] Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Elettron & Informaz, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Lyubartsev, Vladyslav] Ctr Euromediterraneo & Cambiamenti Climat, Bologna, Italy",24,10.1371/journal.pone.0052108,2012

In this study we used Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and molecular techniques (16S rRNA gene marker) to characterize the spatial distribution of cyanobionts in the widely dispersed marine intertidal sponge Hymeniacidon perlevis along the coast of Portugal (Atlantic Ocean). We described new sponge associated cyanobacterial morphotypes (Xenococcus-like) and we further observed Acaryochloris sp. as a sponge symbiont, previously only reported in association with ascidians. Besides these two unique cyanobacteria, H. perlevis predominantly harbored Synechococcus sp. and uncultured marine cyanobacteria. Our study supports the hypothesis that the community of sponge cyanobionts varies irrespective of the geographical location and is likely influenced by seasonal fluctuations. The observed multiple cyanobacterial association among sponges of the same host species over a large distance may be attributed to horizontal transfer of symbionts. This may explain the absence of a co-evolutionary pattern between the sponge host and its symbionts. Finally, in spite of the short geographic sampling distance covered, we observed an unexpected high intra-specific genetic diversity in H. perlevis using the mitochondrial genes ATP6 (pi = 0.00177), COI (pi = 0.00241) and intergenic spacer SP1 (pi = 0.00277) relative to the levels of genetic variation of marine sponges elsewhere. Our study suggests that genotypic variation among the sponge host H. perlevis and the associated symbiotic cyanobacteria diversity may be larger than previously recognized.

Grunts of the speciose genus Haemulon are among the most abundant fishes on western North Atlantic coral reefs, with most species settling to shallow habitats (<= 12 m). To gain understanding into cross-shelf distributional patterns exhibited by newly settled stages of grunts <2 cm total length), we examined: 1) depth-specific distributions of congeners at settlement among sites at 8 m, 12 m, and 21 m, and 2) depth-variable predation pressure on newly settled individuals (species pooled). Of the six species identified from collections of newly settled specimens (n = 2125), Haemulon aurolineatum (tomtate), H. flavolineatum (French grunt), and H. striatum (striped grunt) comprised 98% of the total abundance; with the first two species present at all sites. Prevalence of H. aurolineatum and H. flavolineatum decreased substantially from the 8-m site to the two deeper sites. In contrast, H. striatum was absent from the 8-m site and exhibited its highest frequency at the 21-m site. Comparison of newly settled grunt delta density for all species on caged (predator exclusion) and control artificial reefs at the shallowest site (8-m) revealed no difference, while the 12-m and 21-m sites exhibited significantly greater delta densities on the caged treatment. This result, along with significantly higher abundances of co-occurring piscivorous fishes at the deeper sites, indicated lower predation pressure at the 8-m site. This study suggests habitat-use patterns of newly settled stages of some coral reef fishes that undergo ontogenetic shifts are a function of depth-variable predation pressure while, for at least one deeper-water species, proximity to adult habitat appears to be an important factor affecting settlement distribution.

Here, we describe the association of the tunicate Lissoclinum patella with a symbiotic alpha-proteobacterium, Candidatus Endolissoclinum faulkneri, and present chemical and biological evidence that the bacterium synthesizes patellazoles. We sequenced and assembled the complete Ca. E. faulkneri genome, directly from metagenomic DNA obtained from the tunicate, where it accounted for 0.6% of sequence data.

We use the limpets Patella ulyssiponensis and Patella rustica as models for identifying factors affecting gene flow in marine organisms across the North-East Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. A set of allozyme loci and a fragment of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome C oxidase subunit I were screened for genetic variation through starch gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing, respectively. An approach combining clustering algorithms with clinal analyses was used to test for the existence of barriers to gene flow and estimate their geographic location and abruptness. Sharp breaks in the genetic composition of individuals were observed in the transitions between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean and across southern Italian shores. An additional break within the Atlantic cluster separates samples from the Alboran Sea and Atlantic African shores from those of the Iberian Atlantic shores. The geographic congruence of the genetic breaks detected in these two limpet species strongly supports the existence of transpecific barriers to gene flow in the Mediterranean Sea and Northeastern Atlantic. This leads to testable hypotheses regarding factors restricting gene flow across the study area.

For many coral-algal symbioses, prolonged episodes of thermal stress damage the symbiont's photosynthetic capability, resulting in its expulsion from the host. Despite the link between photosynthetic competency and symbiont expulsion, little is known about the effect of thermal stress on the expression of photosystem genes in Symbiodinium. This study used real-time PCR to monitor the transcript abundance of two important photosynthetic reaction center genes, psbA (encoding the D1 protein of photosystem II) and psaA (encoding the P-700 protein of photosystem I), in four cultured isolates (representing ITS2-types A13, A20, B1, and F2) and two in hospite Symbiodinium spp. within the coral Pocillopora spp. (ITS2-types C1b-c and D1). Both cultured and in hospite Symbiodinium samples were exposed to elevated temperatures (32 degrees C) over a 7-day period and examined for changes in photochemistry and transcript abundance. Symbiodinium A13 and C1b-c (both thermally sensitive) demonstrated significant declines in both psbA and psaA during the thermal stress treatment, whereas the transcript levels of the other Symbiodinium types remained stable. The downregulation of both core photosystem genes could be the result of several different physiological mechanisms, but may ultimately limit repair rates of photosynthetic proteins, rendering some Symbiodinium spp. especially susceptible to thermal stress.","[McGinley, Michael P.; Aschaffenburg, Matthew D.; Pettay, Daniel T.; Warner, Mark E.] Univ Delaware, Coll Earth Ocean & Environm, Lewes, DE 19958 USA; [Smith, Robin T.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [LaJeunesse, Todd C.] Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",24,10.1371/journal.pone.0050439,2012

Because such transitions often unfold on temporal and spatial scales that can be difficult to approach by experimental manipulation, research has often relied on historical observations as a source of natural experiments. Here, we examine a critical difference between selecting systems for study based on the fact that we have observed a critical transition and those systems for which we wish to forecast the approach of a transition. This difference arises by conditionally selecting systems known to experience a transition of some sort and failing to account for the bias this introduces-a statistical error often known as the prosecutor's fallacy. By analysing simulated systems that have experienced transitions purely by chance, we reveal an elevated rate of false-positives in common warning signal statistics. We further demonstrate a model-based approach that is less subject to this bias than those more commonly used summary statistics. We note that experimental studies with replicates avoid this pitfall entirely.","[Boettiger, Carl] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Hastings, Alan] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA",42,10.1098/rspb.2012.2085,2012

The temperate macroalga Delisea pulchra bleaches in Southeast Australia during warm summer periods, a phenomenon which previous studies have indicated is caused by a temperature induced bacterial disease. In order to better understand the ecology of this disease, the bacterial communities associated with threes type of samples was investigated using 16S rRNA gene and environmental shotgun sequencing: 1) unbleached (healthy) D. pulchra 2) bleached parts of D. pulchra and 3) apparently healthy tissue adjacent to bleached regions. Phylogenetic differences between healthy and bleached communities mainly reflected relative changes in the taxa Colwelliaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, Thalassomonas and Parvularcula. Comparative metagenomics showed clear difference in the communities of healthy and diseased D. pulchra as reflected by changes in functions associated with transcriptional regulation, cation/multidrug efflux and non-ribosomal peptide synthesis. Importantly, the phylogenetic and functional composition of apparently healthy tissue adjacent to bleached sections of the thalli indicated that changes in the microbial communities already occur in the absence of visible tissue damage. This shift in unbleached sections might be due to the decrease in furanones, algal metabolites which are antagonists of bacterial quorum sensing. This study reveals the complex shift in the community composition associated with bleaching of Delisea pulchra and together with previous studies is consistent with a model in which elevated temperatures reduce levels of chemical defenses in stressed thalli, leading to colonization or proliferation by opportunistic pathogens or scavengers.","[Fernandes, Neil; Steinberg, Peter; Kjelleberg, Staffan; Thomas, Torsten] Univ New S Wales, Ctr Marine Bioinnovat, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Fernandes, Neil; Kjelleberg, Staffan; Thomas, Torsten] Univ New S Wales, Sch Biotechnol & Biomol Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Steinberg, Peter] Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Steinberg, Peter] Nanyang Technol Univ, Adv Environm Biotechnol Ctr, Singapore, Singapore; [Rusch, Doug] J Craig Venter Inst, Rockville, MD USA; [Kjelleberg, Staffan] Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore Ctr Environm Life Sci Engn, Singapore, Singapore",33,10.1371/journal.pone.0050854,2012

Yet, virtually unknown is the role of crustacean macrograzers on coral reef macroalgae.

Mithrax prefers fleshy macroalgae, but it also consumes relatively unpalatable calcareous algae. Per capita grazing rates by Mithrax exceed those of most herbivorous fish, but Mithrax often occurs at low densities on reefs and its foraging activities are reduced in predator-rich environments. Therefore, the effects of grazing by Mithrax tend to be localized and when at low density contribute primarily to spatial heterogeneity in coral reef macroalgal communities.","[Butler, Mark J.; Mojica, Angela M.] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA",10,10.1007/s00227-012-2027-1,2012

With disturbances predicted to increase, insight into how changes in substrate condition will influence the recruitment of many fishes is essential for understanding the recovery of reef fish populations following biological and physical disturbances. While studies have revealed that both live coral cover and structural complexity are important for many fishes, there is a lack of understanding regarding how a combination of these changes will impact the recruitment of fishes. This study used experimentally constructed patch reefs consisting of six different habitat treatments; three levels of live coral cover (high, medium, low) crossed with two levels of structural complexity (high, low), to test the independent and combined effects of live coral cover and structural complexity on the recruitment and recovery of fish communities. The abundance and species diversity of fishes varied significantly among the six habitat treatments, but differences were not clearly associated with either coral cover or structural complexity and varied through time. More striking, however, was a significant difference in the composition of fish assemblages among treatments, due mostly to disproportionate abundance of coral-dwelling fishes on high coral cover, high complexity reefs. Overall, it appears that coral cover had a more important influence than structural complexity, at least for the contrasting levels of structural complexity achieved on experimental patch reefs. Furthermore, we found that live coral cover is important for the recruitment of some non-coral-dependent fishes. This study confirms that live coral cover is critical for the maintenance of high biodiversity on tropical coral reefs, and that sustained and ongoing declines in coral cover will adversely affect recruitment for many different species of reef fishes.","[Coker, D.

Surveys were conducted during the day and at night (using blue illumination) from three sites inside and three sites outside a closed fishery area (CFA). The relative abundance of 116 fish species from 41 families was recorded. Significant changes were observed in fish assemblage structure from day to night (driven by high dispersion at night) and in areas open versus closed to fishing (driven by increased abundance within the CFA).

This study investigates inter-habitat variation in Caribbean cryptobenthic fishes by re-analysing a comprehensive data set from 58 rotenone stations around Buck Island, U.S. Virgin Islands. Boosted regression trees were used to associate the density and diversity of non-piscivorous cryptobenthic fishes, both in the entire data set and on reef habitats alone, with 14 abiotic and biotic variables. The study also models the habitat requirements of the three commonest species. Dead coral cover was the first or second most important variable in six of the eight models constructed. For example, within the entire data set, the number of species and total fish density increased approximately linearly with increasing dead coral cover. Dead coral was also important in multivariate analyses that discriminated 10 assemblages within the entire data set. On reef habitats, the number of species and total fish density increased dramatically when dead coral exceeded similar to 55 %. Live coral cover was typically less important for explaining variance in fish assemblages than dead coral, but live corals were important for maintaining high fish diversity. Coral species favoured by cryptobenthic species may be particularly susceptible to mortality, but dead coral may also provide abundant food and shelter for many fishes. Piscivore density was a key variable in the final models, but typically increased with increasing cryptobenthic fish diversity and abundance, suggesting both groups of fishes are responding to the same habitat variables. The density of territorial damselfishes reduced the number of cryptobenthic fish species on reef habitats. Finally, habitats delineated by standard remote sensing techniques supported distinct cryptobenthic fish assemblages, suggesting that such maps can be used as surrogates of general patterns of cryptic fish biodiversity in conservation planning.","[Harborne, A.

Recent evidence has highlighted the limited spatial movements of some herbivorous fishes. However, individuals in schools are thought to be much more mobile. The aim of this study, therefore, was to evaluate the spatial range of schooling S. rivulatus to measure the spatial scale over which they exert their functional role. Furthermore, we assess the influence of the schooling behaviour on their feeding rates and thus their ecological impact. The diurnal movements of S. rivulatus were monitored using acoustic transmitters and a passive acoustic array for up to 7 months in Pioneer Bay, Orpheus Island, GBR. In addition, behavioural observations recorded school size-frequency distributions and feeding rates of S. rivulatus inside and outside foraging schools. Despite schooling, all S. rivulatus were site attached. On average, the maximum potential home range of individuals was 24,440 m(2) and ranges overlapped extensively in individuals captured from the same school. School size was highly variable, with a mean school size of 5.7 individuals. Schooling had a significant impact on the functional role of individuals, with feeding rates in schools being two times higher for S. rivulatus and over three times higher for other scarid species. Our results suggest that, despite schooling, individual S. rivulatus only rove over a limited area of reef (occupying a linear stretch of reef, measuring only approximately 250 m for individuals and 220 m for entire schools). Each individual may therefore have little impact on the spatial resilience of coral reefs.","[Welsh, J. Q.; Bellwood, D.

Despite its prevalence, there is a paucity of information regarding its associated invertebrate fauna. The cryptofaunal invertebrate community of the EAM was quantitatively investigated in Pioneer Bay on Orpheus Island, Great Barrier Reef. Using a vacuum collection method, a diversity of organisms representing 10 different phyla were identified. Crustacea dominated the samples, with harpacticoid copepods being particularly abundant (2025 +/- A 132 100 cm(-2); mean density +/- SE). The volume of coarse particulate matter in the EAM was strongly correlated with the abundance of harpacticoid copepods. The estimated biomass of harpacticoid copepods (0.48 +/- A 0.05 g m(-2); wet weight) suggests that this group is likely to be important for reef trophodynamics and nutrient cycling.","[Kramer, M.

In this study, we demonstrate consistent spatial changes in the community-level trophodynamics of 46 species of fish across the fringing Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia, using tissue stable isotope and fatty acid analyses. Increasing nitrogen (delta N-15) and decreasing carbon (delta C-13) isotope ratios in the tissues of herbivores, planktivores and carnivores with increasing proximity to the ocean were indicative of increased reliance on oceanic productivity. In contrast, detritivores and corallivores displayed no spatial change in delta N-15 or delta C-13, indicative of the dependence on reef-derived material across the reef. Higher delta C-13, as well as increased benthic- and bacterial-specific fatty acids, suggested reliance on reef-derived production increased in back-reef habitats. Genus-level analyses supported community- and trophic group-level trends, with isotope modelling of species from five genera (Abudefduf sexfasciatus, Chromis viridis, Dascyllus spp., Pomacentrus spp. and Stegastes spp.), demonstrating declining access to oceanic zooplankton and, in the case of Pomacentrus spp. and Stegastes spp., a switch to herbivory in the back-reef. The spatial changes in fish trophodynamics suggest that the relative roles of oceanic and reef-derived nutrients warrant more detailed consideration in reef-level community ecology.","[Wyatt, A. S.

Few studies, however, have examined the relationship between parasites and growth in the early life history stages of such fishes. This study examined how parasite prevalence (% infected) and load, and the relationship between parasite presence and fish growth, differed among life stages of the damselfish Pomacentrus amboinensis. Parasite prevalence decreased significantly between the larval stage, which was sampled immediately before settlement on the reef (97 %) and recently settled juveniles (60 %); prevalence was also high for 4-month-old juveniles (90 %), 7-month-old juveniles (100 %) and adult fish (100 %). Total numbers of parasites per fish decreased dramatically (fourfold) between larval and recently settled fish, and then increased in the older stages to levels similar to those observed in larvae, but they did so more gradually than did prevalence. One explanation for these patterns is that heavily infected larvae were preferentially removed from the population during or soon after settlement. Daily fish growth, determined from otolith increments, revealed that growth did not differ between parasitised and non-parasitised larval fish, whereas recently settled fish that were parasitised had faster growth; these parasitised recently settled fish also displayed faster growth prior to settlement. These data provide evidence that parasites may explain some of the variation in growth and survival observed among coral reef fishes after settlement and thereby have a greater impact on population dynamics than previously understood.","[Sun, D.; Blomberg, S.

Among the most abundant fish species on Indo-Pacific coral reefs are the surgeonfishes Acanthurus nigrofuscus and Ctenochaetus striatus. A. nigrofuscus is an herbivorous grazer that crops filamentous algae from the epilithic algal matrix, while C. striatus is detritivorous and was thought to 'brush' detritus from the surface of filamentous algae, causing little damage to algal strands. Although the foraging mechanisms and general diet of these surgeonfishes have been established, their grazing impact on epilithic algal turfs has been unclear. This is the first study to quantify the grazing impact of A. nigrofuscus and C. striatus on algal turfs. Through aquaria trials using epilithic algal turf grown on experimental tiles, we found that both A. nigrofuscus and C. striatus consistently fed more intensively upon sparse/short algal turfs even though the yield of algae per bite was greater for dense/long algal turfs. As there was no difference in the nutritional value of sparse and dense algal turfs, we hypothesise that A. nigrofuscus avoided dense turf due to its significantly greater sediment load than sparse turf, while C. striatus likely avoided dense turf as it would become entangled in their bristle-like teeth. Unexpectedly, despite its dental morphology, C. striatus removed significantly more algal turf per hour than A. nigrofuscus, irrespective of canopy height. The capability of C. striatus to remove significant quantities of algal turf through their foraging activity implies that this abundant and widespread species may substantially affect algal turf dynamics. If this is the case, the exclusion of detritivorous Ctenochaetus species from herbivorous fish functional groups used in resilience monitoring will need to be re-evaluated.","[Marshell, A.; Mumby, P.

However, much of what we know of predator identity is based on a small number of detailed studies. This study aims to identify the key predator of early juvenile coral reef fishes on Ningaloo Reef, North-Western Australia. Video cameras were used to observe patch reefs stocked with newly settled reef fish in the back-reef area between 12:00 and 20:30 h. The cameras were fitted with > 610 nm light sources to allow observation in low light conditions. All strikes (attempted and successful) on newly settled fish were recorded, along with the time spent in the vicinity of experimental patch reefs with or without juvenile fish. A total of 69 strikes were observed over the 199 h of recorded video footage, with the majority of strikes occurring mid-afternoon between 13:00 and 15:30 h. Only one strike was observed during the twilight period, an hour either side of sunset (similar to 18:45 h), and no strikes were observed after this period. The moonwrasse, Thalassoma lunare, was responsible for the majority of strikes (75.4 %), with the sandperch (Parapercis clatharatha-10.1 %), spanish flag (Lutjanus carponotatus-5.8 %) and ring wrasse (Hologymnosus annulatus-2.9 %) the next highest contributors. T. lunare also spent significantly more time in the vicinity of reefs stocked with newly settled fish, than those without, during daylight hours. The results of the study are in contrast to the common perception that predation on newly settled fish is focused largely around crepuscular periods and suggests that diurnally active species, in particular T. lunare, are important predators of juvenile fish on the Ningaloo back-reef. The study also implies that generalist species can fulfil key functional roles and that the nature of these roles is not always apparent.","[Holmes, T. H.; Wilson, S.

We describe the clonal architecture of a cold-water coral reef and the fine-scale population genetic structure (< 35 km) of five reef localities in the NE Skagerrak. This study represents the first of this type of analysis from deep waters. We used thirteen microsatellite loci to estimate gene flow and genotypic diversity and to describe the fine-scale spatial distribution of clonal individuals of Lophelia pertusa. Within-population genetic diversity was high in four of the five reef localities. These four reefs constitute a genetic cluster with asymmetric gene flow that indicates metapopulation dynamics. One locality, the Sacken reef, was genetically isolated and depauperate. Asexual reproduction was found to be a highly important mode of reproduction for L. pertusa: 35 genetic individuals were found on the largest reef, with the largest clone covering an area of nearly 300 m(2).","[Dahl, M.

Using a long-term experiment, where L. dimidiatus were regularly removed from seven patch reefs (removals) for 10 years or left undisturbed (controls) on nine, the effect of conspecifics' presence on recently settled L. dimidiatus juveniles and the relationship between juvenile and adult abundance on control reefs were examined. Repeated sampling 4-40 months after manipulating L. dimidiatus revealed that the abundance of juveniles on removals, compared with controls reefs, was 72 % (95 % CI = 65-79 %) lower; this effect did not vary over time. Thus, decreased colonization was associated with resident conspecific absence and this effect was present after 4 months. Since other studies found 4 months of cleaner absence was too short to affect client abundance-a factor also known to enhance L. dimidiatus colonization-it was likely not involved here. Over 10 years, individual control reefs were almost always occupied by at least one adult (89-100 % of times sampled); but in summer, when L. dimidiatus colonization was highest, juvenile abundance was negatively related with adult abundance at one of two sites, with the expected number of juveniles decreasing by 67 % (95 % CI = 51-83 %) with each additional adult. This suggests a deleterious effect of adults on juveniles at one site, such as competition. Enhanced colonization of juveniles associated with adult presence may partly explain the relative permanence of fish cleaning stations.","Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia",3,10.1007/s00338-012-0942-8,2012

Because in the Andaman Sea both, LAIW and monsoon, act from the same westerly direction their relative contribution to reef development is difficult to discern. Here, we explore the framework development in a number of offshore island locations subjected to differential LAIW- and SW-monsoon impact to address this open question. Cumulative negative temperature anomalies - a proxy for LAIW impact - explained a higher percentage of the variability in coral reef framework height, than sedimentation rates which resulted mainly from the monsoon.

Methodology/Principal Findings: We quantified the effects of deposit-feeding sea cucumbers on benthic algal biomass (microphytobenthos, MPB), bacterial abundance, and the sediment-seawater exchange of dissolved oxygen and nutrients. The sea cucumbers increased the efflux of inorganic nitrogen (ammonium, NH4+) from organically enriched sediments, which stimulated algal productivity. Grazing by the sea cucumbers on MPB (evidenced by pheopigments), however, caused a net negative effect on primary producer biomass and total oxygen production. Further, there was an increased abundance of bacteria in sediment with sea cucumbers, suggesting facilitation. The sea cucumbers increased the ratio of oxygen consumption to production in surface sediment by shifting the microbial balance from producers to decomposers. This shift explains the increased efflux of inorganic nitrogen and concordant reduction in organic matter content in sediment with bioturbators.

To shed some light on this controversy, the genetic structure of dogwhelk populations in northwest Spain was investigated with highly polymorphic AFLP markers giving special attention to the influence of hydrodynamic stress. In agreement with the expectations for a poor disperser, our results show a significant genetic structure at regional (<200 km) and areal scales (<15 km). However, the spatial genetic structure varied with wave-exposure in the present case study: IBD was evident under sheltered conditions but absent from the exposed area where genetic differentiation was stronger.

Networks of appropriately sized and spaced reserves can capture a high proportion of species diversity, with gene flow among reserves presumed to promote long term resilience of populations to spatially variable threats. However, numerically rare small range species distributed among isolated locations appear to be at particular risk of extinction and the likely benefits of MPA networks are uncertain. Here we use mitochondrial and microsatellite data to infer evolutionary and contemporary gene flow among isolated locations as well as levels of self-replenishment within locations of the endemic anemonefish Amphiprion mccullochi, restricted to three MPA offshore reefs in subtropical East Australia. We infer high levels of gene flow and genetic diversity among locations over evolutionary time, but limited contemporary gene flow amongst locations and high levels of self-replenishment (68 to 84%) within locations over contemporary time. While long distance dispersal explained the species' integrity in the past, high levels of self-replenishment suggest locations are predominantly maintained by local replenishment. Should local extinction occur, contemporary rescue effects through large scale connectivity are unlikely. For isolated islands with large numbers of endemic species, and high local replenishment, there is a high premium on local species-specific management actions.","[van der Meer, Martin H.; van Herwerden, Lynne] James Cook Univ, Mol Ecol & Evolut Lab, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [van der Meer, Martin H.; Jones, Geoffrey P.; van Herwerden, Lynne] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [van der Meer, Martin H.; Jones, Geoffrey P.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Hobbs, Jean-Paul A.] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Hobbs, Jean-Paul A.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Hobbs, Jean-Paul A.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Perth, WA, Australia; [van Herwerden, Lynne] James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",15,10.1371/journal.pone.0049660,2012

This lack of data restricts the objective management of these extensive benthic habitats. In the context of protecting representative areas of all community types, one important question is the nature of the transition from reefal to sedimentary fish assemblages. We addressed this question using Baited Remote Underwater Videos (BRUVs) to assess fish assemblages of sedimentary habitats at six distances from rocky reefs (0, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 m) at four sites in subtropical eastern Australia. Distance from reef was important in determining fish assemblage structure, and there was no overlap between reef sites and sedimentary sites 400 m from reef. While there was a gradient in assemblage structure at intermediate distances, this was not consistent across sites. All sites, however, supported a mixed 'halo' assemblage comprising both reef and sediment species at sampling stations close to reef. BRUVs used in conjunction with high-resolution bathymetric and backscatter spatial data can resolve differences in assemblage structure at small spatial scales (10s to 100s of metres), and has further application in unconsolidated habitats. Unless a 'reef halo' assemblage is being examined, a minimum of 200 m but preferably 400 m distance from any hard substrate is recommended when designing broader-scale assessments of fish assemblages of sedimentary habitats.","[Schultz, Arthur L.; Smith, Stephen D.

Many organisms spawn multiple times in a breeding season, but few studies have investigated the impact of serial spawning on reproductive allocation. This study investigated whether resource allocation was influenced by parental characteristics and prior spawning history in a serial spawning tropical damselfish (Pomacentrus amboinensis). The offspring attributes of isolated parents of known characteristics were monitored over a 6-week breeding period in the field. Smaller females produced larvae of longer length and larger energy reserves at hatching. This finding is contrary to several other studies that found larger females produce offspring of greater quality. We found that resource allocation in the form of reproductive output was not influenced by the number of spawning events within the breeding season, with larger females producing the greatest number of offspring. Larval characteristics changed as spawning progressed. There was a general decline in length of larvae produced, with an increase in the size of the larval yolk-sac, for all females regardless of size as spawning progressed. This trend was accentuated by the smallest females. This change in larval characteristics may reflect a parental ability to forecast unfavourable conditions as the season progresses or a mechanism to ensure that some will survive no matter what conditions they encounter. This study highlights the importance of accounting for temporal changes in reproductive allocation in studies of reproductive trade-offs and investigations into the importance of parental effects.","[Maddams, Jessica Claire; McCormick, Mark Ian] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld, Australia",9,10.1371/journal.pone.0048525,2012

These fishes live in social groups in which there is a size-based dominance hierarchy. In this structure where sex is socially controlled, agonistic interactions are numerous and serve to maintain size differences between individuals adjacent in rank. Clownfishes are also prolific callers whose sounds seem to play an important role in the social hierarchy. Here, we aim to review and to synthesize the diversity of sounds produced by clownfishes in order to emphasize the importance of acoustic signals in their way of life. Methodology/Principal Findings: Recording the different acoustic behaviors indicated that sounds are divided into two main categories: aggressive sounds produced in conjunction with threat postures (charge and chase), and submissive sounds always emitted when fish exhibited head shaking movements (i.e. a submissive posture). Both types of sounds showed size-related intraspecific variation in dominant frequency and pulse duration: smaller individuals produce higher frequency and shorter duration pulses than larger ones, and inversely. Consequently, these sonic features might be useful cues for individual recognition within the group. This observation is of significant importance due to the size-based hierarchy in clownfish group.

Conclusions/Significance: Unlike other pomacentrids, sounds are not produced for mate attraction in clownfishes but to reach and to defend the competition for breeding status, which explains why constraints are not important enough for promoting call diversification in this group.","[Colleye, Orphal; Parmentier, Eric] Univ Liege, Lab Funct & Evolutionary Morphol, Liege, Belgium",24,10.1371/journal.pone.0049179,2012

Using the Great Barrier Reef as a case study, habitat suitability modelling is used to predict the distribution of deep-water coral reef communities on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. We test the effectiveness of a range of geophysical and environmental variables for predicting the location of deep-water coral reef communities on the Great Barrier Reef. Location: Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Methods: Maximum entropy modelling is used to identify the spatial extent of two broad communities of habitat-forming megabenthos phototrophs and heterotrophs. Models were generated using combinations of geophysical substrate properties derived from multibeam bathymetry and environmental data derived from Bio-ORACLE, combined with georeferenced occurrence records of mesophotic coral communities from autonomous underwater vehicle, remotely operated vehicle and SCUBA surveys. Model results are used to estimate the total amount of mesophotic coral reef habitat on the GBR. Results: Our models predict extensive but previously undocumented coral communities occurring both along the continental shelf-edge of the Great Barrier Reef and also on submerged reefs inside the lagoon. Habitat suitability for phototrophs is highest on submerged reefs along the outer-shelf and the deeper flanks of emergent reefs inside the GBR lagoon, while suitability for heterotrophs is highest in the deep waters along the shelf-edge. Models using only geophysical variables consistently outperformed models incorporating environmental data for both phototrophs and heterotrophs. Main Conclusion: Extensive submerged coral reef communities that are currently undocumented are likely to occur throughout the Great Barrier Reef. High-quality bathymetry data can be used to identify these reefs, which may play an important role in resilience of the GBR ecosystem to climate change.","[Bridge, Tom] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Bridge, Tom] James Cook Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Beaman, Robin] James Cook Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Cairns, Qld, Australia; [Done, Terry] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Webster, Jody] Univ Sydney, Sch Earth Sci, Geocoastal Res Grp, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",19,10.1371/journal.pone.0048203,2012

Here we demonstrate the utility of multi-taxa phylogeography in the design of a system of marine protected areas within Fiji. Gathering mtDNA control region data from five species of coral reef fish in five genera and two families, we find a range of population structure patterns, from those experiencing little (Chrysiptera talboti, Halichoeres hortulanus, and Pomacentrus maafu), to moderate (Amphiprion barberi, Phi(st) = 0.14 and Amblyglyphidodon orbicularis Phi(st) = 0.05) barriers to dispersal. Furthermore estimates of gene flow over ecological time scales suggest species-specific, asymmetric migration among the regions within Fiji. The diversity among species-specific results underscores the limitations of generalizing from single-taxon studies, including the inability to differentiate between a species-specific result and a replication of concordant phylogeographic patterns, and suggests that greater taxonomic coverage results in greater resolution of community dynamics within Fiji. Our results indicate that the Fijian reefs should not be managed as a single unit, and that closely related species can express dramatically different levels of population connectivity.","[Drew, Joshua A.] Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Barber, Paul H.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA USA",22,10.1371/journal.pone.0047710,2012

In marine environments, photosymbiosis with microalgae is best known for sustaining benthic coral reef ecosystems. Despite the importance of oceanic microbiota in global ecology and biogeochemical cycles, symbioses are poorly characterized in open ocean plankton. Here, we describe a widespread symbiotic association between Acantharia biomineralizing microorganisms that are abundant grazers in plankton communities, and members of the haptophyte genus Phaeocystis that are cosmopolitan bloom-forming microalgae. Cophylogenetic analyses demonstrate that symbiont biogeography, rather than host taxonomy, is the main determinant of the association. Molecular dating places the origin of this photosymbiosis in the Jurassic (ca. 175 Mya), a period of accentuated marine oligotrophy. Measurements of intracellular dimethylated sulfur indicate that the host likely profits from antioxidant protection provided by the symbionts as an adaptation to life in transparent oligotrophic surface waters. In contrast to terrestrial and marine symbioses characterized to date, the symbiont reported in this association is extremely abundant and ecologically active in its free-living phase. In the vast and barren open ocean, partnership with photosymbionts that have extensive free-living populations is likely an advantageous strategy for hosts that rely on such interactions. Discovery of the Acantharia-Phaeocystis association contrasts with the widely held view that symbionts are specialized organisms that are rare and ecologically passive outside the host.","[Decelle, Johan; Probert, Ian; Bittner, Lucie; Colin, Sebastien; de Vargas, Colomban; Not, Fabrice] Univ Paris 06, F-29680 Roscoff, France; [Decelle, Johan; Bittner, Lucie; Colin, Sebastien; de Vargas, Colomban; Not, Fabrice] CNRS, UMR 7144, Equipe Evolut Plancton & Paleo Oceans, Biol Stn, F-29680 Roscoff, France; [Probert, Ian] CNRS, FR2424, Biol Stn, F-29680 Roscoff, France; [Desdevises, Yves] Univ Paris 06, F-66651 Banyuls Sur Mer, France; [Desdevises, Yves] CNRS, UMR 7628, Lab Arago, F-66651 Banyuls Sur Mer, France; [Gali, Marti; Simo, Rafel] CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, Barcelona 08003, Catalonia, Spain",42,10.1073/pnas.1212303109,2012

Yet it is unknown how recognition of heterospecific cues arises for coral reef fishes. Here, we test if naive juvenile fish have an innate recognition of heterospecific alarm cues. We also examine if there is a relationship between the intensity of the antipredator response to these cues and the degree to which species are related to each other. Naive juvenile anemone fish, Amphiprion percula, were tested to see if they displayed antipredator responses to chemical alarm cues from four closely related heterospecific species (family Pomacentridae), a distantly related sympatric species (Asterropteryx semipunctatus) and a saltwater (control). Juveniles displayed significant reductions in foraging rate when exposed to all four confamilial heterospecific species but they did not respond to the distantly related sympatric species or the saltwater control. There was also a strong relationship between the intensity of the antipredator response and the extent to which species were related, with responses weakening as species became more distantly related. These findings demonstrate that chemical alarm cues are conserved within the pomacentrid family, providing juveniles with an innate recognition of heterospecific alarm cues as predicted by the phylogenetic relatedness hypothesis.","[Mitchell, Matthew D.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",19,10.1371/journal.pone.0047428,2012

These events consist of the emergence of large swarms of the predatory seastar that feed on reef-building corals, often leading to widespread devastation of coral populations. While cyclic occurrences of such outbreaks are reported from many tropical reefs throughout the Indo-Pacific, their causes are hotly debated, and the spatio-temporal dynamics of the outbreaks and impacts to reef communities remain unclear. Based on observations of a recent event around the island of Moorea, French Polynesia, we show that Acanthaster outbreaks are methodic, slow-paced, and diffusive biological disturbances. Acanthaster outbreaks on insular reef systems like Moorea's appear to originate from restricted areas confined to the ocean-exposed base of reefs. Elevated Acanthaster densities then progressively spread to adjacent and shallower locations by migrations of seastars in aggregative waves that eventually affect the entire reef system. The directional migration across reefs appears to be a search for prey as reef portions affected by dense seastar aggregations are rapidly depleted of living corals and subsequently left behind. Coral decline on impacted reefs occurs by the sequential consumption of species in the order of Acanthaster feeding preferences. Acanthaster outbreaks thus result in predictable alteration of the coral community structure. The outbreak we report here is among the most intense and devastating ever reported. Using a hierarchical, multi-scale approach, we also show how sessile benthic communities and resident coral-feeding fish assemblages were subsequently affected by the decline of corals. By elucidating the processes involved in an Acanthaster outbreak, our study contributes to comprehending this widespread disturbance and should thus benefit targeted management actions for coral reef ecosystems.","[Kayal, Mohsen; Vercelloni, Julie; de Loma, Thierry Lison; Bosserelle, Pauline; Chancerelle, Yannick; Geoffroy, Sylvie; Stievenart, Celine; Michonneau, Francois; Penin, Lucie; Planes, Serge] USR 3278 CNRS EPHE, Ctr Rech Insulaires & Observ Environm, Lab Excellence CORAIL, Moorea, Fr Polynesia; [Kayal, Mohsen; Adjeroud, Mehdi] Inst Rech Dev, U227, COREUS 2, Lab Excellence CORAIL, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Vercelloni, Julie] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Vercelloni, Julie] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Michonneau, Francois] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL USA; [Penin, Lucie] Univ La Reunion, Lab Ecol Marine ECOMAR, Lab Excellence CORAIL, St Denis, Reunion, France",123,10.1371/journal.pone.0047363,2012

The present study uses a field-based experiment to examine how the intensity of interference competition between juveniles of two species of damselfish changes as healthy corals degrade through thermal bleaching. The mortality of a damselfish that is a live coral specialist (Pomacentrus moluccensis) increased on bleached and dead coral in the presence of the habitat generalist (Pomacentrus amboinensis). Increased mortality of the specialist was indirectly owing to enhanced aggression by the generalist forcing the specialist higher up and further away from shelter on bleached and dead coral.

Drivers influencing these fluctuations in abundance of M. alfredi at the site remain uncertain. Based on daily count, behavioural, weather and oceanographic data collected over a three-year period, this study examined the link between the relative number of sightings of manta rays at LEI, the biophysical environment, and the habitat use of individuals around the LEI reef using generalised additive models. The response variable in each of the three generalised additive models was number of sightings (per trip at sea) of cruising, cleaning or foraging M. alfredi. We used a set of eleven temporal, meteorological, biological, oceanographic and lunar predictor variables. Results for cruising, cleaning and foraging M. alfredi explained 27.5%, 32.8% and 36.3% of the deviance observed in the respective models and highlighted five predictors (year, day of year, wind speed, chlorophyll-a concentration and fraction of moon illuminated) as common influences to the three models. There were more manta rays at LEI in autumn and winter, slower wind speeds, higher productivity, and around the new and full moon. The winter peak in sightings of foraging M. alfredi was found to precede peaks in cleaning and cruising activity around the LEI reef, which suggests that enhanced food availability may be a principal driver for this seasonal aggregation. A spatial analysis of behavioural observations highlighted several sites around the LEI reef as 'multi-purpose' areas where cleaning and foraging activities commonly occur, while the southern end of the reef is primarily a foraging area. The use of extensive citizen science datasets, such as those collected by dive operators in this study, is encouraged as they can provide valuable insights into a species' ecology.","[Jaine, Fabrice R.

However, the growing evidence that animals behave more variably while individuals may differ consistently in their behaviour, has led to the development of models that predict a distribution of strategies. Here we support the importance of such models in a study on a coral reef fish host-parasite system. Parasitic blennies (Plagiotremus sp.) regularly attack other fishes to bite off scales and mucus. Individuals of some victim species react to being bitten with punishing the parasite through aggressive chasing. Our field observations and laboratory experiments show that individual blennies differ markedly in how they incorporate being punished into their foraging decisions. We discuss how these differences may affect the payoff structure and hence the net effect of punishment on punishers and on the appearance of a public good for look-alikes.","[Bshary, Andrea; Bshary, Redouan] Univ Neuchatel, Inst Biol, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland",1,10.1371/journal.pone.0045998,2012

In situ observations of larval swimming are few given the constraints of field sampling. Active behaviour is therefore often inferred from spatial patterns in the field, laboratory studies, or hydrodynamic theory, but rarely are these approaches considered in concert. Ichthyoplankton survey data collected during 2004 and 2006 from coastal Newfoundland show that changes in spatial heterogeneity for multiple species do not conform to predictions based on passive transport. We evaluated the interaction of individual larvae with their environment by calculating Reynolds number as a function of ontogeny. Typically, larvae hatch into a viscous environment in which swimming is inefficient, and later grow into more efficient intermediate and inertial swimming environments. Swimming is therefore closely related to length, not only because of swimming capacity but also in how larvae experience viscosity. Six of eight species sampled demonstrated consistent changes in spatial patchiness and concomitant increases in spatial heterogeneity as they transitioned into more favourable hydrodynamic swimming environments, suggesting an active behavioural element to dispersal. We propose the tandem assessment of spatial heterogeneity and hydrodynamic environment as a potential approach to understand and predict the onset of ecologically significant swimming behaviour of larval fishes in the field.","[Stanley, Ryan; Snelgrove, Paul V.

Trophic specialization is a main force driving species evolution and is responsible for classical examples of adaptive radiations in fishes. We investigate the effect of trophic specialization on the rate of environmental niche evolution in the damselfish, Pomacentridae, which is an important family of tropical reef fishes. First, phylogenetic niche conservatism is not detected in the family using a standard test of phylogenetic signal, and we demonstrate that the environmental niches of damselfishes that differ in trophic specialization are not equivalent while they still overlap at their mean values. Second, we estimate the relative rates of niche evolution on the phylogenetic tree and show the heterogeneity among rates of environmental niche evolution of the three trophic groups. We suggest that behavioural characteristics related to trophic specialization can constrain the evolution of the environmental niche and lead to conserved niches in specialist lineages.

We used compound-specific stable isotope analyses to determine movement patterns of commercially important fish populations within a coral reef seascape. This approach allowed us to quantify the relative contributions of individuals from inshore nurseries to reef populations and identify migration corridors among important habitats. Our results provided direct measurements of remarkable migrations by juvenile snapper of over 30 km, between nurseries and reefs. We also found significant plasticity in juvenile nursery residency. Although a majority of individuals on coastal reefs had used seagrass nurseries as juveniles, many adults on oceanic reefs had settled directly into reef habitats.

While a suite of disturbances (overfishing, eutrophication, and global climate change) have been identified, the mechanism(s) of reef system decline remain elusive. Increased microbial and viral loading with higher percentages of opportunistic and specific microbial pathogens have been identified as potentially unifying features of coral reefs in decline. Due to their relative size and high per cell activity, a small change in microbial biomass may signal a large reallocation of available energy in an ecosystem; that is the microbialization of the coral reef. Our hypothesis was that human activities alter the energy budget of the reef system, specifically by altering the allocation of metabolic energy between microbes and macrobes. To determine if this is occurring on a regional scale, we calculated the basal metabolic rates for the fish and microbial communities at 99 sites on twenty-nine coral islands throughout the Pacific Ocean using previously established scaling relationships. From these metabolic rate predictions, we derived a new metric for assessing and comparing reef health called the microbialization score. The microbialization score represents the percentage of the combined fish and microbial predicted metabolic rate that is microbial. Our results demonstrate a strong positive correlation between reef microbialization scores and human impact. In contrast, microbialization scores did not significantly correlate with ocean net primary production, local chla concentrations, or the combined metabolic rate of the fish and microbial communities. These findings support the hypothesis that human activities are shifting energy to the microbes, at the expense of the macrobes. Regardless of oceanographic context, the microbialization score is a powerful metric for assessing the level of human impact a reef system is experiencing.","[McDole, Tracey; Barott, Katie L.; Hatay, Mark; Nosrat, Bahador; Youle, Merry; Rohwer, Forest] San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Nulton, James; Felts, Ben; Hand, Carol; Lee, Hochul; Salamon, Peter; Bailey, Barbara] San Diego State Univ, Dept Math & Comp Sci, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Vargas-Angel, Bernardo; Brainard, Russell E.] NOAA Fisheries, Pacific Islands Fisheries Sci Ctr, Honolulu, HI USA; [Sandin, Stuart A.; Zgliczynski, Brian J.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Nadon, Marc O.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Nadon, Marc O.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Joint Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",27,10.1371/journal.pone.0043233,2012

Here, we provide, to our knowledge, the first evidence that settlement-stage coastal crab species can interpret and show a strong settlement and metamorphosis response to habitat-related differences in natural underwater sound. Laboratory-and field-based experiments demonstrated that time to metamorphosis in the settlement-stage larvae of common coastal crab species varied in response to different underwater sound signatures produced by different habitat types. The megalopae of five species of both temperate and tropical crabs showed a significant decrease in time to metamorphosis, when exposed to sound from their optimal settlement habitat type compared with other habitat types.

Benthic algal communities play an important role in these ecosystems due to their ecological functions and support a great part of this biological richness. We tested by means of bio-optical modelling and Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS) images to what extent remote sensing could be used to map these communities in Ria de Vigo and Ria de Aldan (NW Spain). Reflectance spectra of dominating macroalgae groups were modelled for different water depths in order to estimate the separability of different bottom types based on their spectral signatures and the spectral characteristics of the AHS. Our results indicate that separation between three macroalgae groups (green, brown and red) as well as sand is possible when the bottoms are emerged during low tide. The spectra differences decrease rapidly with increasing water depth. Two types of classifications were carried out with the three AHS images: maximum likelihood and spectral angle mapper (SAM). Maximum likelihood showed positive results reaching overall accuracy percentages higher than 95 % and kappa coefficients higher than 0.90 for the bottom classes: shallow sand, deep sand, emerged rock, emerged macroalgae and submerged macroalgae. Sand and algae substrates were then separately analysed with SAM. These classifications showed positive results for differentiation between green and brown macroalgae until 5 m depth and high differences between all macroalgae and sandy substrate. However, differences between red and brown macroalgae are only detectable when the algae are emerged.","[Casal, G.; Sanchez-Carnero, N.; Freire, J.] Univ A Coruna, Grp Recursos Marinos & Pesquerias, Fac Ciencias, La Coruna 15008, Spain; [Dominguez-Gomez, J.

Recruits < 30 days old were surveyed in two primary habitat types (reef and rubble) in each of two replicate reserve and non-reserve sites. Recruitment of all fish species peaked in the summer and early fall; winter recruitment was consistently low. Some interannual recruitment patterns were roughly similar among species, with recruitment generally lower in 2004 for several taxa, possibly reflecting a system-wide process. During 7 peak recruitment months each year, overall recruitment to reef habitat was significantly higher in non-reserve sites in 2 of 7 years. In contrast, recruitment to rubble habitat was significantly higher in reserves in 3 of 7 years. Specific fish taxa had variable patterns of recruitment to reserves and non-reserves: Despite high interannual variation in recruitment magnitude, Scaridae (parrotfish) densities were significantly higher in reserves than in non-reserves. Densities of two abundant goby taxa (Gnatholepis thompsoni and Coryphopterus spp.) were also higher in reserves than in non-reserves, but the magnitude varied among years. Recruitment of the bicolor damselfish, Stegastes partitus, did not differ consistently between reserves and non-reserves. Densities of Thalassoma bifasciatum had an opposite trend relative to other taxa, with densities typically higher in non-reserves than in reserves (in 6 of 7 years; significant in only 2 years). Higher recruit densities (scarids, gobies, and all rubble taxa together) within reserves were coupled with significantly lower densities of intermediate-sized piscivores and significantly greater cover of Dictyota spp. macroalgae and turfs relative to non-reserves. Reserves may be areas of relative refuge from predation for some fish recruits due to a combination of reduced predator abundance and enhanced small-scale structural habitat.","[Sponaugle, S.; Walter, K.

Similar to tropical rainforests and their insects, the majority of reef animal species are small and cryptic, living in the cracks and crevices of structural taxa (trees and corals). Although the cryptofauna make up the majority of a reef's metazoan biodiversity, we know little about their basic ecology. We sampled motile cryptofaunal communities from both live corals and dead carbonate reef framework across a gradient of increasing erosion on a reef in Pacific Panama. A total of 289 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) from six phyla were identified. We used species-accumulation models fitted to individual- and sample-based rarefaction curves, as well as seven nonparametric richness estimators to estimate species richness among the different framework types. All procedures predicted the same trends in species richness across the differing framework types. Estimated species richness was higher in dead framework (261-370 OTUs) than in live coral substrates (112-219 OTUs). Surprisingly, richness increased as framework structure was eroded: coral rubble contained the greatest number of species (227-320 OTUs) and the lowest estimated richness of 47-115 OTUs was found in the zone where the reef framework had the greatest vertical relief. This contradicts the paradigm that abundant live coral indicates the apex of reef diversity.","[Enochs, I. C.; Manzello, D. P.] NOAA, AOML, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Enochs, I. C.; Manzello, D.

Coral reefs are no exception. However, there is a paucity of information relating to the performance of acoustic receivers on coral reefs. Our results suggest that the detection performance of acoustic receivers may be significantly impacted by the unique nature of the reef environment. This study assessed the performance of passive acoustic receivers on a typical inner-shelf fringing reef, Orpheus Island, on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. The detection range and diel performance variability of acoustic receivers was assessed using two parallel lines of 5 VR2W receivers spanning 125 m, deployed on the reef base and reef crest. Two 9-mm acoustic transmitters were moored at opposite ends of each receiver line. The working detection range for receivers was found to be approximately 90 m for the transmitter moored on the reef base and just 60 m for the transmitter moored on the reef crest. However, the detection range on the reef crest increased to 90 m when just the reef crest receivers were considered, highlighting importance of optimal receiver deployment. No diel patterns in receiver performance or detection capacities were detected, suggesting that no corrections are required when interpreting nocturnal versus diurnal activity patterns. We suggest that studies aiming for complete coverage of a site within a reef environment will require receivers in close (< 100 m) proximity, and that the placement depth of receivers must be a major consideration, with shallow receivers exhibiting a greater detection range than those on the reef slope. Our results highlight the challenges imposed by coral reefs for acoustic telemetry and the importance of receiver placement for studies conducted within these habitats.","[Welsh, J. Q.; Fox, R.

Although information on sexual systems now exists for over 400 scleractinian species, data are still lacking for some important reef-building taxa. The vast majority of scleractinians are either simultaneous hermaphrodites or gonochoric with other sexual systems rarely occurring. Diploastrea heliopora is one of the most ubiquitous and easily recognised reef-building species in the Indo-West Pacific; however, surprisingly little is known about its reproductive biology. The aim of the present study was to examine the reproductive biology of D. heliopora colonies on chronically impacted, equatorial reefs south of Singapore. Here we show that in Singapore, D. heliopora is a broadcast spawner with predominantly gonochoric polyps. Colonies, however, contained male, female and a low proportion of cosexual polyps during the 14-month sampling period. The most plausible explanation for this is that polyps switch sexes with oogenic and spermatogenic cycles occasionally overlapping. This leads to colony level alternation of sex function within and between breeding seasons. While this sexual system is atypical for scleractinians, it supports molecular evidence that D. heliopora is phylogenetically distinct from species formerly in the family Faviidae.","[Guest, J.

There is a limited understanding of how these environmental changes are likely to impact coral reef fishes, especially in terms of population replenishment through the quality of progeny produced. The present study investigated the effect that elevated sea water temperature and changes to food availability may have on the production of offspring by the reef fish Acanthochromis polyacanthus (Pomacentridae), as well as the performance of progeny in environments of varying food availability. An orthogonal design of three water temperatures and two food availabilities (high and low ration) was used, with water temperatures being the current-day average for the collection location (28.5 A degrees C), +1.5 A degrees C (30.0 A degrees C) and +3.0 A degrees C (31.5 A degrees C), representing likely temperatures by 2100. Generally, an increase in the water temperature for adults resulted in a reduction in the size, weight and amount of yolk possessed by newly hatched offspring. Offspring whose parents were maintained under elevated temperature (30.0 A degrees C high ration) had lower survival than offspring produced by parents at the current-day temperature (28.5 A degrees C high ration) at 15 days post-hatching, but only when juveniles were reared under conditions of low food availability. In contrast, by 30 days post-hatching, the growth and condition of these offspring produced by parents held under elevated temperature (30.0 A degrees C high ration) were the best of all treatment groups in all levels of juvenile food availability. This result illustrates the potential for initial parental effects to be modified by compensatory growth early in life (within 1 month) and that parental effects are not necessarily long lasting. These findings suggest that the performance of juvenile reef fish in future ocean conditions may not only depend on initial parental effects, but the interaction between their parentally mediated phenotype and their present food availability.","[Donelson, J.

The consequences of such a widespread loss of complex structure on ecosystem processes are still unclear. We sought to determine whether the disappearance of complex structure has adversely affected grazing and invertebrate predation rates on a shallow reef in the FKNMS. Surprisingly, we found grazing rates and invertebrate predation rates were lower in the structurally complex A. palmata branches than on the topographically simple degraded reefs. We attribute these results to high densities of aggressively territorial damselfish, Stegastes planifrons, living within A. palmata. Our study suggests the presence of agonistic damselfish can cause the realized spatial patterns of ecosystem processes to deviate from the expected patterns. Reef ecologists must therefore carefully consider the assemblage of associate fish communities when assessing how the mortality of A. palmata has affected coral reef ecosystem processes.","[Lemoine, N.

The Lemonpeel Angelfish (Centropyge flavissima) has Pacific and Indian Ocean forms separated by approximately 3,000 km and slight differences in coloration. These disjunct populations hybridize with Eibl's Angelfish (Centropyge eibli) in the eastern Indian Ocean and the Pearl-Scaled Angelfish (Centropyge vrolikii) in the western Pacific. To resolve the evolutionary history of these species and color morphs, we employed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome b and three nuclear introns (TMO, RAG2, and S7). Phylogenetic analyses reveal three deep mtDNA lineages (d = 7.0-8.3 %) that conform not to species designation or color morph but to geographic region: (1) most Pacific C. flavissima plus C. vrolikii, (2) C. flavissima from the Society Islands in French Polynesia, and (3) Indian Ocean C. flavissima plus C. eibli. In contrast, the nuclear introns each show a cluster of closely related alleles, with frequency differences between the three geographic groups. Hence, the mtDNA phylogeny reveals a period of isolation (ca. 3.5-4.2 million years) typical of congeneric species, whereas the within-lineage mtDNA I broken vertical bar(ST) values and the nuclear DNA data reveal recent or ongoing gene flow between species. We conclude that an ancient divergence of C. flavissima, recorded in the non-recombining mtDNA, was subsequently swamped by introgression and hybridization in two of the three regions, with only the Society Islands retaining the original C. flavissima haplotypes among our sample locations. Alternatively, the yellow color pattern of C. flavissima may have appeared independently in the central Pacific Ocean and eastern Indian Ocean. Regardless of how the pattern arose, C. flavissima seems to be retaining species identity where it interbreeds with C. vrolikii and C. eibli, and sexual or natural selection may help to maintain color differences despite apparent gene flow.","[DiBattista, Joseph D.; Waldrop, Ellen; Bowen, Brian W.; Schultz, Jennifer K.] Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; [Gaither, Michelle R.; Rocha, Luiz A.] Calif Acad Sci, Sect Ichthyol, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA; [Pyle, Richard L.] Bernice P Bishop Museum, Honolulu, HI 96817 USA",40,10.1007/s00338-012-0907-y,2012

Here, we describe a rapid, non-destructive approach to carbonate budget assessments, termed ReefBudget that is census-based and which focuses on quantifying the relative contributions made by different biological carbonate producer/eroder groups to net reef framework carbonate production. The methodology is presently designed only for Caribbean sites, but has potential to be adapted for use in other regions. Rates are calculated using data on organism cover and abundance, combined with annual extension or production rate measures. Set against this are estimates of the rates at which bioeroding species of fish, urchins and internal substrate borers erode reef framework. Resultant data provide a measure of net rates of biologically driven carbonate production (kg CaCO3 m(-2) year(-1)). These data have potential to be integrated into ecological assessments of reef state, to aid monitoring of temporal (same-site) changes in rates of biological carbonate production and to provide insights into the key ecological drivers of reef growth or erosion as a function of environmental change. Individual aspects of the budget methodology can also be used alongside other census approaches if deemed appropriate for specific study aims. Furthermore, the methodology spreadsheets are user-changeable, allowing local or new process/rate data to be integrated into calculations. Application of the methodology is considered at sites around Bonaire. Highest net rates of carbonate production, +9.52 to +2.30 kg CaCO3 m(-2) year(-1), were calculated at leeward sites, whilst lower rates, +0.98 to -0.98 kg CaCO3 m(-2) year(-1), were calculated at windward sites.

This study investigated the foraging ecology of a common coral reef predator, the dottyback Pseudochromis fuscus, using underwater focal animal observations. Observations were conducted at two times of year: the summer, when recruit fishes were an available food item and winter, when remaining juveniles had outgrown vulnerability to P. fuscus. During the summer, P. fuscus directed 76% of its strikes at invertebrates and 24% at recruiting juvenile fishes. When striking at fishes, P. fuscus exhibited two distinct feeding modes: an ambush (26% successful) and a pursuit mode (5% successful). Predator activity in the field peaked at midday, averaging 2.5 captures h(-1) of juvenile fishes. Monitoring of activity and foraging in the laboratory over 24-h periods found that P. fuscus was a diurnal predator and was active for 13 h d(-1) during the summer. The number of hours during which foraging was recorded differed greatly among individuals (n = 10), ranging from 4 to 13 h. The number of predatory strikes did not increase with standard length, but the success rate and consumption rate of juvenile fishes did increase with size. Estimated hourly mortality on juvenile fish ranged from 0.49 fish h(-1) in small P. fuscus individuals (30-39 mm standard length, SL; equating to 6.3 per 13 h day) to 2.4 fish h(-1) in large P. fuscus individuals (55-65 mm SL; 30.6 per 13 h day). During the winter, P. fuscus struck at invertebrates with a similar rate to the summer period. These observations of the predatory ecology of P. fuscus support the hypothesis that in coral reef systems, small piscivores, because of their high metabolism and activity, are probably important regulators of coral reef fish community composition.","[Feeney, W.

The frequency of disturbance has meant that species susceptible to disturbance, such as those in the genus Acropora and Montipora have almost disappeared from the reef. Indeed, almost all hard coral species have declined in abundance, with the result that total hard coral cover in 2010 (17.7%) was less than half what it was in 1985 (47.5%). In addition, macro-algal cover has increased from 11.3% in 2003 to 28.5% in 2010.

Methodology/Principal Findings: We examined long term trends in the marine climate at the Abrolhos using historical sea surface temperature data (HadISST data set) from 1900-2011. In addition in situ water temperature data for the Abrolhos (from data loggers installed in 2008, across four island groups) were used to determine temperature exposure profiles. Coupled with the results of coral cover surveys conducted annually since 2007; we calculated bleaching thresholds for monitoring sites across the four Abrolhos groups. Conclusions/Significance: In situ temperature data revealed maximum daily water temperatures reached 29.54 degrees C in March 2011 which is 4.2 degrees C above mean maximum daily temperatures (2008-2010). The level of bleaching varied across sites with an average of similar to 12% of corals bleached. Mortality was high, with a mean similar to 50% following the 2011 bleaching event. Prior to 2011, summer temperatures reached a mean (across all monitoring sites) of 25.1 degrees C for 2.5 days. However, in 2011 temperatures reached a mean of 28.1 degrees C for 3.3 days. Longer term trends (1900-2011) showed mean annual sea surface temperatures increase by 0.01 degrees C per annum. Long-term temperature data along with short-term peaks in 2011, outline the potential for corals to be exposed to more frequent bleaching risk with consequences for this high latitude coral reef system at the edge of its distribution.","[Abdo, David A.; Bellchambers, Lynda M.; Evans, Scott N.] Govt Western Australia, Dept Fisheries, Biodivers & Biosecur Branch, Marine Ecol & Monitoring Sect, Hillarys, WA, Australia",31,10.1371/journal.pone.0043878,2012

We asked experts and reviewed the scientific literature for guidance on the multiple physical and biological factors that affect the ability of coral reefs to resist and recover from climate disturbance. Eleven key factors to inform decisions based on scaling scientific evidence and the achievability of quantifying the factors were identified. Factors important to resistance and recovery, which are important components of resilience, were not strongly related, and should be assessed independently. The abundance of resistant (heat-tolerant) coral species and past temperature variability were perceived to provide the greatest resistance to climate change, while coral recruitment rates, and macroalgae abundance were most influential in the recovery process. Based on the 11 key factors, we tested an evidence-based framework for climate change resilience in an Indonesian marine protected area. The results suggest our evidence-weighted framework improved upon existing un-weighted methods in terms of characterizing resilience and distinguishing priority sites. The evaluation supports the concept that, despite high ecological complexity, relatively few strong variables can be important in influencing ecosystem dynamics. This is the first rigorous assessment of factors promoting coral reef resilience based on their perceived importance, empirical evidence, and feasibility of measurement. There were few differences between scientists' perceptions of factor importance and the scientific evidence found in journal publications but more before and after impact studies will be required to fully test the validity of all the factors. The methods here will increase the feasibility and defensibility of including key resilience metrics in evaluations of coral reefs, as well as reduce costs.

While reef-building corals respond negatively to warming (i.e. bleaching events) and ocean acidification (OA), the extent of present-day natural variability in pH on shallow reefs and ecological consequences for benthic assemblages is unknown. We documented high resolution temporal patterns in temperature and pH from three reefs in the central Pacific and examined how these data relate to community development and net accretion rates of early successional benthic organisms. These reefs experienced substantial diel fluctuations in temperature (0.78 degrees C) and pH (>0.2) similar to the magnitude of 'warming' and 'acidification' expected over the next century. Where daily pH within the benthic boundary layer failed to exceed pelagic climatological seasonal lows, net accretion was slower and fleshy, non-calcifying benthic organisms dominated space.

We used stylet increment analysis to age a wild O. cyanea population for the first time and gonad histology to examine their reproductive characteristics. O. cyanea conforms to many cephalopod life history generalisations having rapid, non-asymptotic growth, a short life-span and high levels of mortality. Males were found to mature at much younger ages and sizes than females with reproductive activity concentrated in the spring and summer months. The female dominated sex-ratios in association with female brooding behaviours also suggest that larger conspicuous females may be more prone to capture and suggests that this intertidal octopus population has the potential to be negatively impacted in an unregulated fishery. Size at age and maturity comparisons between our temperate bordering population and lower latitude Tanzanian and Hawaiian populations indicated stark differences in growth rates that correlate with water temperatures. The variability in life history traits between global populations suggests that management of O. cyanea populations should be tailored to each unique set of life history characteristics and that stylet increment analysis may provide the integrity needed to accurately assess this.","[Herwig, Jade N.; Depczynski, Martial; Heyward, Andrew J.] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Inst, Australian Inst Marine Sci, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Roberts, John D.; Gagliano, Monica] Univ Western Australia, Sch Anim Biol, Ctr Evolutionary Biol, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Semmens, Jayson M.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Res, Fisheries Aquaculture & Coasts Ctr, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Gagliano, Monica] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Microscopy Characterisat & Anal, Perth, WA 6009, Australia",8,10.1371/journal.pone.0043679,2012

Among PBD measures, the PhyloSor and UniFrac indices have been widely used to assess the level of turnover of lineages over geographical and environmental gradients. However, these indices can be considered as 'broad-sense' measures of phylogenetic turnover as they incorporate different aspects of differences in evolutionary history between communities that may be attributable to phylogenetic diversity gradients. In the present study, we extend an additive partitioning framework proposed for compositional beta diversity to PBD. Specifically, we decomposed the PhyloSor and UniFrac indices into two separate components accounting for 'true' phylogenetic turnover and phylogenetic diversity gradients, respectively. We illustrated the relevance of this framework using simple theoretical and archetypal examples, as well as an empirical study based on coral reef fish communities. Overall, our results suggest that using PhyloSor and UniFrac may greatly over-estimate the level of spatial turnover of lineages if the two compared communities show contrasting levels of phylogenetic diversity. We therefore recommend that future studies use the 'true' phylogenetic turnover component of these indices when the studied communities encompass a large phylogenetic diversity gradient.","[Leprieur, Fabien; Albouy, Camille; De Bortoli, Julien; Mouillot, David] Univ Montpellier 2, Lab Ecol Syst Marins Cotiers, UMR 5119, Montpellier, France; [Cowman, Peter F.; Bellwood, David R.; Mouillot, David] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Cowman, Peter F.; Bellwood, David R.; Mouillot, David] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",57,10.1371/journal.pone.0042760,2012

Many coral reef fish species settle preferentially to live coral at the end of their larval phase where they interact with other species that recruited to the same habitat patch at a similar time. Mortality is high and usually selective and individuals must compete for low risk space. This study examined the competitive interactions between two species of juvenile damselfish and the extent to which interactions that occurred within a recruitment cohort established the disjunct distribution patterns that were displayed in later life stages. Censuses and field experiments with juveniles found that one species, the ambon damsel, was dominant immediately after settlement and pushed the subordinate species higher up the reef and further from shelter. Presence of a competitor resulted in reduced growth for both species. Juvenile size was the best predictor of competitive success and outweighed the effects of short term prior residency. Size at settlement also dramatically influenced survival, with slightly larger individuals displaying higher aggression, pushing the subordinate species into higher risk habitats. While subordinates had higher feeding rates, they also sustained higher mortality. The study highlights the importance of interaction dynamics between species within a recruitment cohort to patterns of growth and distribution of species within communities.","[McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",35,10.1371/journal.pone.0042590,2012

These degraded reef systems have been mostly described based on changes in the composition of the reef benthos, and there is little understanding of how such changes are influenced by, and in turn influence, other components of the reef ecosystem. This study investigated the spatial variation in benthic communities on fringing reefs around the inner Seychelles islands. Specifically, relationships between benthic composition and the underlying substrata, as well as the associated fish assemblages were assessed. High variability in benthic composition was found among reefs, with a gradient from high coral cover (up to 58%) and high structural complexity to high macroalgae cover (up to 95%) and low structural complexity at the extremes. This gradient was associated with declining species richness of fishes, reduced diversity of fish functional groups, and lower abundance of corallivorous fishes. There were no reciprocal increases in herbivorous fish abundances, and relationships with other fish functional groups and total fish abundance were weak. Reefs grouping at the extremes of complex coral habitats or low-complexity macroalgal habitats displayed markedly different fish communities, with only two species of benthic invertebrate feeding fishes in greater abundance in the macroalgal habitat. These results have negative implications for the continuation of many coral reef ecosystem processes and services if more reefs shift to extreme degraded conditions dominated by macroalgae.","[Chong-Seng, Karen M.; Mannering, Thomas D.; Pratchett, Morgan S.; Bellwood, David R.; Graham, Nicholas A.

Most coral reefs exist in oligotrophic waters, and their survival strategy in such nutrient-depleted waters remains largely unknown. In this study, we found that two strains of Symbiodinium spp. cultured from the environment and acquired from the tissues of the coral Alveopora japonica had the ability to feed heterotrophically. Symbiodinium spp. fed on heterotrophic bacteria, cyanobacteria (Synechococcus spp.), and small microalgae in both nutrient-replete and nutrient-depleted conditions. Cultured free-living Symbiodinium spp. displayed no autotrophic growth under nitrogen-depleted conditions, but grew when provided with prey. Our results indicate that Symbiodinium spp.'s mixotrophic activity greatly increases their chance of survival and their population growth under nitrogen-depleted conditions, which tend to prevail in coral habitats. In particular, free-living Symbiodinium cells acquired considerable nitrogen from algal prey, comparable to or greater than the direct uptake of ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, or urea. In addition, free-living Symbiodinium spp. can be a sink for planktonic cyanobacteria (Synechococcus spp.) and remove substantial portions of Synechococcus populations from coral reef waters. Our discovery of Symbiodinium's feeding alters our conventional views of the survival strategies of photosynthetic Symbiodinium and corals.","[Jeong, Hae Jin; Yoo, Yeong Du; Kang, Nam Seon; Lim, An Suk; Lee, Sung Yeon; Lee, Moo Joon; Lee, Kyung Ha] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul 151747, South Korea; [Seong, Kyeong Ah; Yih, Wonho] Kunsan Natl Univ, Dept Oceanog, Kunsan 573701, South Korea; [Kim, Hyung Seop] Kunsan Natl Univ, Dept Marine Biotechnol, Kunsan 573701, South Korea; [Shin, Woongghi; Nam, Seung Won] Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Biol, Taejon 305763, South Korea; [Lee, Kitack] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Pohang 790784, South Korea",65,10.1073/pnas.1204302109,2012

Interspecific comparisons have been suggested as important for understanding the evolution of animal personality; however, these are seldom accomplished due, in part, to the lack of statistical tools for quantifying differences and similarities in behaviour between groups of individuals. We used nine species of closely-related coral reef fishes to investigate the usefulness of ecological community analyses for the analysis of between-species behavioural differences and behavioural heterogeneity. We first documented behavioural carryover across species by observing the fishes' behaviour and measuring their response to a threatening stimulus to quantify boldness. Bold fish spent more time away from the reef and fed more than shy fish. We then used ecological community analysis tools (canonical variate analysis, multi-response permutation procedure, and permutational analysis of multivariate dispersion) and identified four 'clusters' of behaviourally similar fishes, and found that the species differ in the behavioural variation expressed; some species are more behaviourally heterogeneous than others. We found that ecological community analysis tools are easily and fruitfully applied to comparative studies of personality and encourage their use by future studies.","[Carter, Alecia J.] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Feeney, William E.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Feeney, William E.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",12,10.1371/journal.pone.0042440,2012

However, an examination of the literature demonstrates that a range of different bait types are being used. The use of different types of bait can create an additional source of variability in sampling programs. Coral reef fish assemblages at the Houtman Abrolhos Islands, Western Australia, were sampled using baited remote underwater stereo-video systems. One-hour stereo-video recordings were collected for four different bait treatments (pilchards, cat food, falafel mix and no bait (control)) from sites inside and outside a targeted fishery closure (TFC). In total, 5209 individuals from 132 fish species belonging to 41 families were recorded. There were significant differences in the fish assemblage structure and composition between baited and non-baited treatments (P<0.001), while no difference was observed with species richness. Samples baited with cat food and pilchards contained similar ingredients and were found to record similar components of the fish assemblage. There were no significant differences in the fish assemblages in areas open or closed to fishing, regardless of the bait used. Investigation of five targeted species indicated that the response to different types of bait was species-specific. For example, the relative abundance of Pagrus auratus was found to increase in areas protected from fishing, but only in samples baited with pilchards and cat food. The results indicate that the use of bait in conjunction with stereo-BRUVs is advantageous. On balance, the use of pilchards as a standardised bait for stereo-BRUVs deployments is justified for use along the mid-west coast of Western Australia.","[Dorman, Stacey R.; Harvey, Euan S.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Dorman, Stacey R.; Harvey, Euan S.] Univ Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst M470, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Dorman, Stacey R.; Newman, Stephen J.] Govt Western Australia, Dept Fisheries, Western Australian Fisheries & Marine Res Labs, Perth, WA, Australia",39,10.1371/journal.pone.0041538,2012

However, such exhaustive taxonomic lists (i.e., true surrogate of biodiversity) require extensive and expensive censuses, and the use of estimator surrogates (e.g., habitats) is an appealing alternative. In truth, surrogate effectiveness appears from the literature highly variable both in marine and terrestrial ecosystems, making it difficult to provide practical recommendations for managers. Here, we evaluate how the biodiversity reference data set and its inherent bias can influence effectiveness. Specifically, we defined habitats by geomorphology, rugosity, and benthic cover and architecture criteria, and mapped them with satellite images for a New-Caledonian site. Fish taxonomic and functional lists were elaborated from Underwater Visual Censuses, stratified according to geomorphology and exposure. We then tested if MPA networks designed to maximize habitat richness, diversity and rarity could also effectively maximize fish richness, diversity, and rarity. Effectiveness appeared highly sensitive to the fish census design itself, in relation to the type of habitat map used and the scale of analysis. Spatial distribution of habitats (estimator surrogate's distribution), quantity and location of fish census stations (target surrogate's sampling), and random processes in the MPA design all affected effectiveness to the point that one small change in the data set could lead to opposite conclusions. We suggest that previous conclusions on surrogacy effectiveness, either positive or negative, marine or terrestrial, should be considered with caution, except in instances where very dense data sets were used without pseudo-replication. Although this does not rule out the validity of using surrogates of species lists for conservation planning, the critical joint examination of both target and estimator surrogates is needed for every case study.","[Van Wynsberge, Simon; Andrefouet, Serge; Hamel, Melanie A.] IRD, UR CoReUs, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Kulbicki, Michel] IRD, UR CoReUs, Lab Arago, Banyuls Sur Mer, France",12,10.1371/journal.pone.0040997,2012

This is a consequence of their varied feeding behaviors ranging from targeted consumption of living plant material (primarily surgeonfishes) to feeding on detrital aggregates that are either scraped from the reef surface or excavated from the deeper reef substratum (primarily parrotfishes). Increased fishing pressure and widespread habitat destruction have led to population declines for several species of these two groups. Species-specific data on global distribution, population status, life history characteristics, and major threats were compiled for each of the 179 known species of parrotfishes and surgeonfishes to determine the likelihood of extinction of each species under the Categories and Criteria of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Due in part to the extensive distributions of most species and the life history traits exhibited in these two families, only three (1.7%) of the species are listed at an elevated risk of global extinction. The majority of the parrotfishes and surgeonfishes (86%) are listed as Least Concern, 10% are listed as Data Deficient and 1% are listed as Near Threatened. The risk of localized extinction, however, is higher in some areas, particularly in the Coral Triangle region. The relatively low proportion of species globally listed in threatened Categories is highly encouraging, and some conservation successes are attributed to concentrated conservation efforts. However, with the growing realization of man's profound impact on the planet, conservation actions such as improved marine reserve networks, more stringent fishing regulations, and continued monitoring of the population status at the species and community levels are imperative for the prevention of species loss in these groups of important and iconic coral reef fishes.","[Comeros-Raynal, Mia T.; Polidoro, Beth A.; Sanciangco, Jonnell C.; Harwell, Heather; Carpenter, Kent E.] Old Dominion Univ, IUCN Species Programme, SSC Marine Biodivers Unit Global Marine Species A, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [Choat, John Howard] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Clements, Kendall D.] Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland 1, New Zealand; [Abesamis, Rene] Silliman Univ, Dumaguete, Negros Oriental, Philippines; [Craig, Matthew T.] Univ San Diego, Dept Marine Sci & Environm Studies, San Diego, CA 92110 USA; [Lazuardi, Muhammad Erdi] Conservat Int, Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia; [McIlwain, Jennifer] Curtin Univ Technol, Dept Environm & Agr, Perth, WA, Australia; [Muljadi, Andreas] Coral Triangle Ctr, Sanur, Bali, Indonesia; [Myers, Robert F.] Coral Graph, Wellington, FL USA; [Nanola, Cleto L., Jr.] Univ Philippines Mindanao, Coll Sci & Math, Davao, Philippines; [Pardede, Shinta] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Indonesia Marine Program, Bogor, Jawa Barat, Indonesia; [Rocha, Luiz A.] Calif Acad Sci, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA; [Russell, Barry] Charles Darwin Univ, Arafura Timor Res Facil C, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Brinkin, NT, Australia",29,10.1371/journal.pone.0039825,2012

These shifts have been proposed as a potential mechanism by which corals might survive climate stressors, such as increased temperatures. Conventional molecular methods suggest this adaptive capacity may not be widespread because few (similar to 25%) coral species have been found to associate with multiple Symbiodinium clades. However, these methods can fail to detect low abundance symbionts (typically less than 10-20% of the total algal symbiont community). To determine whether additional Symbiodinium clades are present, but are not detected using conventional techniques, we applied a high-resolution, real-time PCR assay to survey Symbiodinium (in clades A-D) from 39 species of phylogenetically and geographically diverse scleractinian corals. This survey included 26 coral species thought to be restricted to hosting a single Symbiodinium clade ('symbiotic specialists'). We detected at least two Symbiodinium clades (C and D) in at least one sample of all 39 coral species tested; all four Symbiodinium clades were detected in over half (54%) of the 26 symbiotic specialist coral species. Furthermore, on average, 68 per cent of all sampled colonies within a given coral species hosted two or more symbiont clades. We conclude that the ability to associate with multiple symbiont clades is common in scleractinian (stony) corals, and that, in coral-algal symbiosis, 'specificity' and 'flexibility' are relative terms: specificity is rarely absolute. The potential for reef corals to adapt or acclimatize to environmental change via symbiont community shifts may therefore be more phylogenetically widespread than has previously been assumed.","[Silverstein, Rachel N.; Baker, Andrew C.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Biol & Fisheries, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Correa, Adrienne M.

Nevertheless, little is known about how biofilm community structure generally responds to environmental changes. This study aimed to identify patterns of bacterial dynamics in coral reef biofilms in response to associated macrofouling community structure, microhabitat (exposed vs. sheltered), seasonality, and eutrophication. Settlement tiles were deployed at four reefs along a cross-shelf eutrophication gradient and were exchanged every 4 months over 20 months. The fouling community composition on the tiles was recorded and the bacterial community structure was assessed with the community fingerprinting technique Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (ARISA). Bacterial operational taxonomic unit (OTU) number was higher on exposed tiles, where the fouling community was homogenous and algae-dominated, than in sheltered habitats, which were occupied by a variety of filter feeders. Furthermore, OTU number was also highest in eutrophied near-shore reefs, while seasonal variations in community structure were most pronounced in the oligotrophic mid-shelf reef. In contrast, the macrofouling community structure did not change significantly with seasons. Changes in bacterial community patterns were mostly affected by microhabitat, seasonal and anthropogenically derived changes in nutrient availability, and to a lesser extent by changes in the macrofouling community structure. Path analysis revealed a complex interplay of various environmental and biological factors explaining the spatial and temporal variations in bacterial biofilm communities under natural conditions.","[Sawall, Yvonne] Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Ecol, Bremen, Germany; [Richter, Claudio] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Bremerhaven, Germany; [Ramette, Alban] Max Planck Inst Marine Microbiol, HGF MPG Grp Deep Sea Ecol & Technol, Bremen, Germany",29,10.1371/journal.pone.0039951,2012

To date, the majority of studies examining herbivory in coral reef environments have focused on the roles of fishes and/or urchins, with relatively few studies considering the potential role of macroherbivores in reef processes. Here, we introduce evidence that highlights the potential role of marine turtles as herbivores on coral reefs. While conducting experimental habitat manipulations to assess the roles of herbivorous reef fishes we observed green turtles (Chelonia mydas) and hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) showing responses that were remarkably similar to those of herbivorous fishes. Reducing the sediment load of the epilithic algal matrix on a coral reef resulted in a forty-fold increase in grazing by green turtles. Hawksbill turtles were also observed to browse transplanted thalli of the macroalga Sargassum swartzii in a coral reef environment. These responses not only show strong parallels to herbivorous reef fishes, but also highlight that marine turtles actively, and intentionally, remove algae from coral reefs. When considering the size and potential historical abundance of marine turtles we suggest that these potentially valuable herbivores may have been lost from many coral reefs before their true importance was understood.","[Goatley, Christopher H.

Averting this disaster requires maintaining a sufficient spawning population to buffer stochastic fluctuations in recruitment of heavily harvested stocks. Optimal strategies for managing spawner biomass are well developed for temperate systems, yet remain uncertain for tropical fisheries, where the danger of collapse from recruitment overfishing looms largest. In this study, we explored empirically and through modeling, the role of marine reserves in maximizing spawner biomass of a heavily exploited reef fish, Lethrinus harak around Guam, Micronesia. On average, spawner biomass was 16 times higher inside the reserves compared with adjacent fished sites. Adult density and habitat-specific mean fish size were also significantly greater. We used these data in an age-structured population model to explore the effect of several management scenarios on L. harak demography. Under minimum-size limits, unlimited extraction and all rotational-closure scenarios, the model predicts that preferential mortality of larger and older fish prompt dramatic declines in spawner biomass and the proportion of male fish, as well as considerable declines in total abundance. For rotational closures this occurred because of the mismatch between the scales of recovery and extraction. Our results highlight how alternative management scenarios fall short in comparison to marine reserves in preserving reproductively viable fish populations on coral reefs.","[Taylor, Brett M.; Kerr, Alexander M.] Univ Guam, Marine Lab, Mangilao, GU 96923 USA; [Taylor, Brett M.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [McIlwain, Jennifer L.] Curtin Univ Technol, Dept Environm & Agr, Perth, WA, Australia; [Kerr, Alexander M.] Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld, Australia",13,10.1371/journal.pone.0039599,2012

We investigate the abundance and length of demersal fish assemblages across a section of tropical continental shelf at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia, to identify fish and fish habitat relationships across steep gradients in depth and in different benthic habitat types. The assemblage composition of demersal fish were assessed from baited remote underwater stereo-video samples (n = 304) collected from 16 depth and habitat combinations. Samples were collected across a depth range poorly represented in the literature from the fringing reef lagoon (1-10 m depth), down the fore reef slope to the reef base (10-30 m depth) then across the adjacent continental shelf (30-110 m depth). Multivariate analyses showed that there were distinctive fish assemblages and different sized fish were associated with each habitat/depth category. Species richness, MaxN and diversity declined with depth, while average length and trophic level increased. The assemblage structure, diversity, size and trophic structure of demersal fishes changes from shallow inshore habitats to deeper water habitats. More habitat specialists (unique species per habitat/depth category) were associated with the reef slope and reef base than other habitats, but offshore sponge-dominated habitats and inshore coral-dominated reef also supported unique species. This suggests that marine protected areas in shallow coral-dominated reef habitats may not adequately protect those species whose depth distribution extends beyond shallow habitats, or other significant elements of demersal fish biodiversity. The ontogenetic habitat partitioning which is characteristic of many species, suggests that to maintain entire species life histories it is necessary to protect corridors of connected habitats through which fish can migrate.","[Fitzpatrick, Ben M.; Harvey, Euan S.] Univ Western Australia, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Oceans Inst, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Fitzpatrick, Ben M.; Harvey, Euan S.] Univ Western Australia, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Sch Plant Biol, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Fitzpatrick, Ben M.; Twiggs, Emily J.] Oceanwise Environm Scientists, Perth, WA, Australia; [Heyward, Andrew J.; Colquhoun, Jamie] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Oceans Inst, Perth, WA, Australia; [Twiggs, Emily J.] Curtin Univ Technol, Dept Appl Geol, Perth, WA, Australia",44,10.1371/journal.pone.0039634,2012

Methodology/Principal Findings: Manipulative experiments were undertaken to ascertain the role of environmental stressors in this syndrome. Specifically, the effects of elevated temperature and sedimentation on sponge health and symbiont stability in I. basta were examined. Neither elevated temperature nor increased sedimentation were responsible for the brown spot lesions, but sponges exposed to 32 degrees C developed substantial discoloration and deterioration of their tissues, resulting in death after eight days and a higher microbial diversity in those samples. No shifts in the microbial community of I. basta were observed across a latitudinal gradient or with increased sedimentation, with three previously described symbionts dominating the community of all sponges (Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Thaumarchaea).

Paternally mouthbrooding cardinalfishes present an ideal system to investigate the constraints of functional coupling as the oral jaws of male fishes are directly responsible for both feeding and reproductive functions. To test the effects of (i) mouthbrooding on feeding and (ii) feeding on reproductive potential we compared the feeding apparatus between sexes of nine species of cardinalfish and compared brood characteristics among species from different trophic groups, respectively. Mouthbrooding was strongly associated with the morphology of the feeding apparatus in males. Male cardinalfishes possessed longer heads, snouts and jaws than female conspecifics irrespective of body size, trophic group or evolutionary history. Conversely, reproductive potential also appeared to be related to trophic morphology. Piscivorous cardinalfishes produced larger, but fewer eggs, and had smaller brood volumes than species from the two invertebrate feeding groups. These interrelationships suggest that feeding and reproduction in the mouth of cardinalfishes may be tightly coupled. If so this may, in part, have contributed to the limited morphological diversification exhibited by cardinalfishes.","[Hoey, Andrew S.] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia; [Hoey, Andrew S.; Bellwood, David R.; Barnett, Adam] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Bellwood, David R.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Barnett, Adam] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Fisheries Aquaculture & Coasts Ctr, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",4,10.1098/rspb.2011.2679,2012

This association may be due to greater availability of shelters, but surprisingly little is known about the size and density of shelters and their use by coral reef fishes. We quantified shelter availability and use by fishes for the first time on a Caribbean coral reef by counting all holes and overhangs with a minimum entrance diameter >= 3 cm in 30 quadrats (25 m(2)) on two fringing reefs in Barbados. Shelter size was highly variable, ranging from 42 cm(3) to over 4,000,000 cm(3), with many more small than large shelters. On average, there were 3.8 shelters m(-2), with a median volume of 1,200 cm(3) and a total volume of 52,000 cm(3) m(-2). The number of fish per occupied shelter ranged from 1 to 35 individual fishes belonging to 66 species, with a median of 1. The proportion of shelters occupied and the number of occupants increased strongly with shelter size. Shelter density and total volume increased with substrate complexity, and this relationship varied among reef zones. The density of shelter-using fish was much more strongly predicted by shelter density and median size than by substrate complexity and increased linearly with shelter density, indicating that shelter availability is a limiting resource for some coral reef fishes. The results demonstrate the importance of large shelters for fish density and support the hypothesis that structural complexity is associated with fish abundance, at least in part, due to its association with shelter availability. This information can help identify critical habitat for coral reef fishes, predict the effects of reductions in structural complexity of natural reefs and improve the design of artificial reefs.","[Menard, Alexandre; Turgeon, Katrine; Roche, Dominique G.; Binning, Sandra A.; Kramer, Donald L.] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada; [Turgeon, Katrine] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Roche, Dominique G.; Binning, Sandra A.] Australian Natl Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Res Sch Biol, Canberra, ACT, Australia",14,10.1371/journal.pone.0038450,2012

However, it remains unclear whether variation in growth occurs at similar spatial scales for populations of highly migratory pelagic species, such as tuna. We examined spatial variation in growth of albacore Thunnus alalunga across 90 degrees of longitude in the South Pacific Ocean from the east coast of Australia to the Pitcairn Islands. Using length-at-age data from a validated ageing method we found evidence for significant variation in length-at-age and growth parameters (L-infinity and k) between sexes and across longitudes. Growth trajectories were similar between sexes up until four years of age, after which the length-at-age for males was, on average, greater than that for females. Males reached an average maximum size more than 8 cm larger than females. Length-at-age and growth parameters were consistently greater at more easterly longitudes than at westerly longitudes for both females and males. Our results provide strong evidence that finer spatial structure exists within the South Pacific albacore stock and raises the question of whether the scale of their ""highly migratory"" nature should be re-assessed.

Uncertainty remains, however, about whether predators can influence patterns of temporal niche construction at ecologically relevant timescales. Partitioning of time is an important mechanism by which prey avoid interactions with predators. However, the traits that control a prey organism's capacity to operate during a particular portion of the diel cycle are diverse and complex. Thus, diel prey niches are often assumed to be relatively unlikely to respond to changes in predation risk at short timescales. Here we present evidence to the contrary. We report results that suggest that the anthropogenic depletion of daytime active predators (species that are either diurnal or cathemeral) in a coral reef ecosystem is associated with rapid temporal niche expansions in a multi-species assemblage of nocturnal prey fishes. Diurnal comparisons of nocturnal prey fish abundance in predator rich and predator depleted reefs at two atolls revealed that nocturnal fish were approximately six (biomass) and eight (density) times more common during the day on predator depleted reefs. Amongst these, the prey species that likely were the most specialized for nocturnal living, and thus the most vulnerable to predation (i.e. those with greatest eye size to body length ratio), showed the strongest diurnal increases at sites where daytime active predators were rare. While we were unable to determine whether these observed increases in diurnal abundance by nocturnal prey were the result of a numerical or behavioral response, either effect could be ecologically significant. These results raise the possibility that predation may play an important role in regulating the partitioning of time by prey and that anthropogenic depletions of predators may be capable of causing rapid changes to key properties of temporal community architecture.","[McCauley, Douglas J.; Hoffmann, Eva; Micheli, Fiorenza] Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA; [Young, Hillary S.] Harvard Univ, Ctr Environm, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",14,10.1371/journal.pone.0038871,2012

Our study explores how feeding history influences the relative importance of olfactory and visual sensory modes of learning, and how the experience gained through these sensory modes influences behaviour and survival in the field for a juvenile coral reef damselfish. We collected young fish immediately prior to their settlement to benthic habitats. In the laboratory, these predator-naive fish were exposed to a high-or low-food ration and then conditioned to recognize the olfactory cues (odours) and/or visual cues from two common benthic predators. Fish were then allowed to settle on reefs in the field, and their behaviour and survival over 70 h were recorded. Feeding history strongly influenced their willingness to take risks in the natural environment. Conditioning in the laboratory with visual, olfactory or both cues from predators led fish in the field to display risk-averse behaviour compared with fish conditioned with sea water alone. Well-fed fish that were conditioned with visual, chemical or a combination of predator cues survived eight times better over the first 48 h on reefs than those with no experience of benthic predator cues. This experiment highlights the importance of a flexible and rapid mechanism of learning the identity of predators for survival of young fish during the critical life-history transition between pelagic and benthic habitats.","[Loennstedt, Oona M.; McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Loennstedt, Oona M.; McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Meekan, Mark G.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, UWA Ocean Sci Ctr MO96, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Ferrari, Maud C.

In these circumstances we expect that species inhabiting lagoons should show shallow genetic architecture relative to species inhabiting more stable outer reefs. Here we test this expectation on an ocean-basin scale with four wrasses (genus Halichoeres): H. claudia (N = 194, with oceanwide distribution) and H. ornatissimus (N = 346, a Hawaiian endemic) inhabit seaward reef slopes, whereas H. trimaculatus (N = 239) and H. margaritaceus (N = 118) inhabit lagoons and shallow habitats throughout the Pacific. Two mitochondrial markers (cytochrome oxidase I and control region) were sequenced to resolve population structure and history of each species. Haplotype and nucleotide diversity were similar among all four species. The outer reef species showed significantly less population structure, consistent with longer pelagic larval durations. Mismatch distributions and significant negative Fu's F values indicate Pleistocene population expansion for all species, and (contrary to expectations) shallower histories in the outer slope species. We conclude that lagoonal wrasses may persist through glacial habitat disruptions, but are restricted to refugia during lower sea level stands. In contrast, outer reef slope species have homogeneous and well-connected populations through their entire ranges regardless of sea level fluctuations. These findings contradict the hypothesis that shallow species are less genetically diverse as a consequence of glacial cycles.","[Ludt, William B.; Bernal, Moises A.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Marine Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Bowen, Brian W.] Univ Hawaii, Hawaiian Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI USA; [Rocha, Luiz A.] Calif Acad Sci, Dept Ichthyol, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA",20,10.1371/journal.pone.0038042,2012

In the marine environment, few pristine areas relatively free of human impact remain to provide baselines of ecosystem function and goals for restoration efforts. Recent comparisons of remote and/or protected coral reefs versus impacted sites suggest remote systems are dominated by apex predators, yet in these systems the ecological role of nonpredatory, large-bodied, highly vulnerable species such as the giant bumphead parrotfish (Bolbometopon muricatum) has received less attention. Overfishing of Bolbometopon has lead to precipitous declines in population density and avoidance of humans throughout its range, contributing to its status as a candidate species under the U. S. Endangered Species Act and limiting opportunities to study unexploited populations. Here we show that extraordinary ecological processes, such as violent headbutting contests by the world's largest parrotfish, can be revealed by studying unexploited ecosystems, such as the coral reefs of Wake Atoll where we studied an abundant population of Bolbometopon. Bolbometopon is among the largest of coral reef fishes and is a well known, charismatic species, yet to our knowledge, no scientific documentation of ritualized headbutting exists for marine fishes. Our observations of aggressive headbutting by Bolbometopon underscore that remote locations and marine reserves, by inhibiting negative responses to human observers and by allowing the persistence of historical conditions, can provide valuable opportunities to study ecosystems in their natural state, thereby facilitating the discovery, conservation, and interpretation of a range of sometimes remarkable behavioral and ecological processes.","[Munoz, Roldan C.; Teer, Bradford Z.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Beaufort Lab, Beaufort, NC USA; [Zgliczynski, Brian J.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Ctr Marine Biodivers & Conservat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Laughlin, Joseph L.] Mariculture Hawaii LLC, Ashland, OR USA",4,10.1371/journal.pone.0038120,2012

Here we provide a comprehensive and integrated view of biological responses to future warming during the early ontogeny of a keystone invertebrate, the squid Loligo vulgaris. Methodology/Principal Findings: Recently-spawned egg masses were collected and reared until hatching at present day and projected near future (+2 degrees C)temperatures, to investigate the ability of early stages to undergo thermal acclimation, namely phenotypic altering of morphological, behavioural, biochemical and physiological features. Our findings showed that under the projected near-future warming, the abiotic conditions inside the eggs promoted metabolic suppression, which was followed by premature hatching. Concomitantly, the less developed newborns showed greater incidence of malformations. After hatching, the metabolic burst associated with the transition from an encapsulated embryo to a planktonic stage increased linearly with temperature. However, the greater exposure to environmental stress by the hatchlings seemed to be compensated by physiological mechanisms that reduce the negative effects on fitness. Heat shock proteins (HSP70/HSC70) and antioxidant enzymes activities constituted an integrated stress response to ocean warming in hatchlings (but not in embryos). Conclusions/Significance: The stressful abiotic conditions inside eggs are expected to be aggravated under the projected near-future ocean warming, with deleterious effects on embryo survival and growth. Greater feeding challenges and the lower thermal tolerance limits of the hatchlings are strictly connected to high metabolic demands associated with the planktonic life strategy. Yet, we found some evidence that, in the future, the early stages might support higher energy demands by adjusting some cellular functional properties to increase their thermal tolerance windows.","[Rosa, Rui; Pimentel, Marta S.; Boavida-Portugal, Joana; Teixeira, Tatiana; Truebenbach, Katja] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Lab Maritimo Guia, Ctr Oceanog, Cascais, Portugal; [Diniz, Mario] Univ Nova Lisboa, REQUIMTE, Dept Quim, Ctr Quim Fina & Biotecnol,Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, Caparica, Portugal",42,10.1371/journal.pone.0038282,2012

Likewise, nursery habitats such as mangroves enhance populations of some species in adjacent habitats. However, there is lack of understanding of the magnitude of stock enhancement and the effects on community structure when both protection from fishing and access to nurseries concurrently act as drivers of fish population dynamics. In this study we test the separate as well as interactive effects of marine reserves and nursery habitat proximity on structure and abundance of coral reef fish communities. Reserves had no effect on fish community composition, while proximity to nursery habitat only had a significant effect on community structure of species that use mangroves or seagrass beds as nurseries. In terms of reef fish biomass, proximity to nursery habitat by far outweighed (biomass 249% higher than that in areas with no nursery access) the effects of protection from fishing in reserves (biomass 21% lower than non-reserve areas) for small nursery fish (<= 25 cm total length). For large-bodied individuals of nursery species (>25 cm total length), an additive effect was present for these two factors, although fish benefited more from fishing protection (203% higher biomass) than from proximity to nurseries (139% higher). The magnitude of elevated biomass for small fish on coral reefs due to proximity to nurseries was such that nursery habitats seem able to overrule the usually positive effects on fish biomass by reef reserves. As a result, conservation of nursery habitats gains importance and more consideration should be given to the ecological processes that occur along nursery-reef boundaries that connect neighboring ecosystems.","[Nagelkerken, Ivan; Grol, Monique G.

This is the first report of DNA identification of stomach contents of lionfish using the barcode of life reference database (BOLD). Methodology/Principal Findings: We confirm with barcoding that only Pterois volitans is apparently present in the Mexican Caribbean. We analyzed the stomach contents of 157 specimens of P. volitans from various locations in the region. Based on DNA matches in the Barcode of Life Database (BOLD) and GenBank, we identified fishes from five orders, 14 families, 22 genera and 34 species in the stomach contents. The families with the most species represented were Gobiidae and Apogonidae. Some prey taxa are commercially important species. Seven species were new records for the Mexican Caribbean: Apogon mosavi, Coryphopterus venezuelae, C. thrix, C. tortugae, Lythrypnus minimus, Starksia langi and S. ocellata. DNA matches, as well as the presence of intact lionfish in the stomach contents, indicate some degree of cannibalism, a behavior confirmed in this species by the first time. We obtained 45 distinct crustacean prey sequences, from which only 20 taxa could be identified from the BOLD and GenBank databases. The matches were primarily to Decapoda but only a single taxon could be identified to the species level, Euphausia americana. Conclusions/Significance: This technique proved to be an efficient and useful method, especially since prey species could be identified from partially-digested remains. The primary limitation is the lack of comprehensive coverage of potential prey species in the region in the BOLD and GenBank databases, especially among invertebrates.","[Valdez-Moreno, Martha; Quintal-Lizama, Carolina] El Colegio Frontera Sur, Unidad Chetumal, Quintana Roo, Mexico; [Gomez-Lozano, Ricardo; del Carmen Garcia-Rivas, Maria] Comis Nacl Areas Nat Protegidas, Quintana Roo, Mexico",67,10.1371/journal.pone.0036636,2012

We report on opportunistic before-after-control-impact surveys describing changes to coral reef communities both 4 weeks into the harvest and 1 year later compared with pre-harvest conditions. Prior to the harvest, there was a gradient in mean fish abundance and biomass per transect, with highest levels in the north of the closure (250 fish transect(-1), 8,145.8 kg ha(-1)), intermediate levels in the south of the closure (159 fish transect(-1), 4,672.1 kg ha(-1)) and lowest levels in the control area open to fishing (109 fish transect(-1), 594.0 kg ha(-1)). During the harvest, there were extensive depletions in large-bodied, primary targeted fish species, with significant loss in biomass of Acanthuridae and Carangidae in the north and Lutjanidae and Serranidae in the south. We also observed significant increases in Acanthuridae, Lethrinidae and Scaridae in the control, suggesting a ""bail-out"" effect whereby fish left the closure in response to a rapid increase in fishing pressure. These changes were coupled with a large increase in turf algal cover at all survey areas, despite a large numerical increase in small, roving acanthurids (e.g., Ctenochaetus striatus) and scarids (e.g., Chlorurus sordidus). By 1 year later, fish biomass was significantly lower within the closure than before the harvest, while values in the control returned to pre-harvest levels, suggesting non-compliance with the reinstated fishing ban. We use the lessons learned from this event to suggest recommendations for promoting effective management of periodically harvested customary closures that are a common feature across much of Oceania.","[Jupiter, S.

While most prey remains lacked diagnostic morphological characters, 94% of the prey found in 67 fishes had > 98% sequence similarity with BIOCODE reference sequences.

Here, we test the hypothesis that increased temperature leads to bleaching in dinoflagellate-bearing foraminifera similar to corals and that increased nutrients through runoff can exaggerate stress on the holobiont. In an experiment manipulating temperatures alone, we have shown that mortality of Marginopora vertebralis increased with temperatures. Most individuals died after 7 days at 34A degrees C, similar to 5A degrees C above current summer maxima. Survival at 37 days was > 98% at 28A degrees C. After 7 days of exposure to 31 or 32A degrees C, photosynthesis of the endosymbionts was compromised, as indicated by several photophysiological parameters (effective quantum yield and apparent photosynthetic rate). In a flow-though experiment manipulating both temperature (three levels, 26, 29 and 31A degrees C) and nitrate concentrations (3 levels, similar to 0.5, 1.0 and 1.4 mu mol l(-1) NO3 (-)), elevated temperature had a significant negative effect on most parameters measured. At 31A degrees C, most photopigments (measured by UPLC) in the foraminifera were significantly reduced. The only pigment that increased was the photoprotective diatoxanthin. Several other parameters measured (maximum and effective quantum yield, O-2 production in light, organic carbon contents) also significantly decreased with temperature. Optode-based respirometry demonstrated that the presence of symbionts at elevated temperatures represents a net carbon loss for the host. Growth rates of M. vertebralis and mortality at the end of the experiment were significantly affected by both temperature increase and nitrate addition. We conclude that these foraminifera bleach in a similar fashion to corals and that global sea surface temperature change and nitrate increases are stressors for these protists. Furthermore, this provides support for the hypothesis that management of local stressors elevates resilience of coral reefs to global stressors.","[Uthicke, S.; Doyle, J.; Humphrey, C.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Vogel, N.] Univ Munich, Munich, Germany; [Schmidt, C.] Univ Tubingen, Dept Geosci, Tubingen, Germany",40,10.1007/s00338-011-0851-2,2012

To explore the role of coral morphology in providing shelter for fishes, tabular, branching and massive corals were filmed with video cameras and their usage by large reef fishes compared. Tabular corals were utilised more than the other two morphologies, with at least triple the abundance, biomass and residence times of large fishes. The preference of coral reef fishes for specific structural traits of tabular corals was also examined using artificial structural units. This experimental component showed that large reef fishes preferred opaque rather than translucent canopies. It appears that large fishes cue to tabular corals because of the concealment and/or shade provided. It is suggested that a loss of tabular corals as a result of climate change would have significant ecological impacts for the coral reef fishes that use these structures for shelter.","[Kerry, J.

Here we show that the distribution of this species-rich habitat can be explained by one environmental predictor: wave exposure. The relationship between wave exposure and the occurrence of Montastraea reefs was modelled using logistic regression for reefs throughout the Belize Barrier Reef, one of the largest and most topographically complex systems in the region. The model was able to predict correctly the occurrence of Montastraea reefs with an accuracy of 81%. Consistent with historical qualitative patterns, the distribution of Montastraea reefs is constrained in environments of high exposure. This pattern is likely to be driven by high rates of chronic sediment scour that constrain recruitment. The wide range of wave exposure conditions used to parameterize the model in Belize suggest that it should be transferable throughout much of the Caribbean region, constituting a fast and inexpensive alternative to traditional habitat mapping and complementing global efforts to map reef extent.","[Chollett, I.; Mumby, P.

In January 2010, the Florida Keys experienced one of the coldest 12-day periods on record, during which water temperatures decreased below the lethal limit for many tropical reef taxa for several consecutive days. This study provides a quantitative assessment of the scleractinian mortality and acute changes to benthic cover at four patch reefs in the middle and upper Keys that coincided with this cold-water event. Significant decreases in benthic cover of scleractinian corals, gorgonians, sponges, and macroalgae were observed between summer 2009 and February 2010. Gorgonian cover declined from 25.6 +/- A 4.6% (mean +/- A SE) to 13.3 +/- A 2.7%, scleractinian cover from 17.6 +/- A 1.4% to 10.7 +/- A 0.9%, macroalgal cover from 8.2 +/- A 5.2% to 0.7 +/- A 0.3%, and sponge cover from 3.8 +/- A 1.4% to 2.3 +/- A 1.2%. Scleractinian mortality varied across sites depending upon the duration of lethal temperatures and the community composition. Montastraea annularis complex cover was reduced from 4.4 +/- A 2.4% to 0.6 +/- A 0.2%, and 93% of all colonies surveyed suffered complete or partial mortality. Complete or partial mortality was also observed in > 50% of all Porites astreoides and Montastraea cavernosa colonies and resulted in a significant reduction in cover. When compared with historical accounts of cold-water-induced mortality, our results suggest that the 2010 winter mortality was one of the most severe on record. The level of coral mortality on patch reefs is of particular concern because corals in these habitats had previously demonstrated resistance against stressors (e.g., disease and warm-water bleaching) that had negatively affected corals in other habitats in the Florida Keys during recent decades.","[Colella, M.

We used the results of field surveys covering 9.5A degrees of latitude of the Great Barrier Reef to describe the distribution, abundance and temporal dynamics of farmer communities. Redundancy analysis revealed unique subregional assemblages of farming species that were shaped by the combined effects of shelf position and, to a lesser extent, by latitude. These spatial patterns were largely stable through time, except when major disturbances altered the benthic community. Such disturbances affected the functional guilds of farmers in different ways. Since different guilds of farmers modify benthic community structure and affect survival of juvenile corals in different ways, these results have important implications for coral recovery following disturbances.","[Emslie, M.

The study showed that although the number of individual L. atkinsoni juveniles decreased by > 90 % during their stay in the seagrass nursery, the shelter and/or food availability functions of the nursery, at least for a juvenile size of approximately 5 cm total length (TL), provided the best survival and growth option. The timing of ontogenetic migration to coral reefs of larger fish (> 8 cm TL) was attributed to foraging efficiency for larger food items in different habitats. Overall, the function of the seagrass bed nursery changed with juvenile body size, with marginally higher survival and significantly greater growth rates during early juvenile stages in seagrass beds compared to coral reefs.

This skewing is exacerbated in locations where exotic species are predominantly low-trophic level consumers such as benthic macrophytes, detritivores, and filter feeders. However, in some systems where numerous exotic predators have been added, sometimes purposefully as in many freshwater systems, food webs are skewed in the opposite direction toward consumer dominance. Little is known about how such modifications to food web topology, e.g., changes in the ratio of predator to prey species richness, affect ecosystem functioning. We experimentally measured the effects of trophic skew on production in an estuarine food web by manipulating ratios of species richness across three trophic levels in experimental mesocosms. After 24 days, increasing macroalgal richness promoted both plant biomass and grazer abundance, although the positive effect on plant biomass disappeared in the presence of grazers. The strongest trophic cascade on the experimentally stocked macroalgae emerged in communities with a greater ratio of prey to predator richness (bottom-rich food webs), while stronger cascades on the accumulation of naturally colonizing algae (primarily microalgae with some early successional macroalgae that recruited and grew in the mesocosms) generally emerged in communities with greater predator to prey richness (the more top-rich food webs). These results suggest that trophic skewing of species richness and overall changes in food web topology can influence marine community structure and food web dynamics in complex ways, emphasizing the need for multitrophic approaches to understand the consequences of marine extinctions and invasions.","[Reynolds, Pamela L.; Bruno, John F.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Reynolds, Pamela L.] Coll William & Mary, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Gloucester Point, VA USA",6,10.1371/journal.pone.0036196,2012

At coarser scale (generic pattern across regions), patterns were more uniform (regionally consistent generic dominance on differently exposed reef slopes and at different depths). Neither fine-nor coarse-scale patterns aligned along the sampled 1700 km latitudinal gradient. Thus, a latitudinal gradient that had been described earlier from comparable datasets, separating the Red Sea into three faunistic zones, was no longer apparent.

In this study, we characterized the transcriptional responses in larval zebrafish exposed to cold or heat stress using microarray analysis. In comparison with genes expressed in the control at 28 degrees C, a total of 2680 genes were found to be affected in 96 hpf larvae exposed to cold (16 degrees C) or heat (34 degrees C) for 2 and 48 h and most of these genes were expressed in a temperature-specific and temporally regulated manner. Bioinformatic analysis identified multiple temperature-regulated biological processes and pathways. Biological processes overrepresented among the earliest genes induced by temperature stress include regulation of transcription, nucleosome assembly, chromatin organization and protein folding. However, processes such as RNA processing, cellular metal ion homeostasis and protein transport and were enriched in genes up-regulated under cold exposure for 48 h. Pathways such as mTOR signalling, p53 signalling and circadian rhythm were enriched among cold-induced genes, while adipocytokine signalling, protein export and arginine and praline metabolism were enriched among heat-induced genes. Although most of these biological processes and pathways were specifically regulated by cold or heat, common responses to both cold and heat stresses were also found.

In fish and other organisms with complex life histories, regulation may involve density dependence in different life-stages and vital rates. We studied density dependence in body growth and mortality through the life-cycle of laboratory populations of zebrafish Danio rerio. When feed input was held constant at population-level (leading to resource limitation), body growth was strongly density-dependent in the late juvenile and adult phases of the life-cycle. Density dependence in mortality was strong during the early juvenile phase but declined thereafter and virtually ceased prior to maturation. Provision of feed in proportion to individual requirements (easing resource limitation) removed density dependence in growth and substantially reduced density dependence in mortality, thus indicating that 'bottom-up' effects act on growth as well as mortality, but most strongly on growth. Both growth and mortality played an important role in population regulation, with density-dependent growth having the greater impact on population biomass while mortality had the greatest impact on numbers. We demonstrate a clear ontogenic pattern of change in density-dependent processes within populations of a very small (maximum length 5 mm) fish, maintained in constant homogeneous laboratory conditions. The patterns are consistent with those distilled from studies on wild fish populations, indicating the presence of broad ontogenic patterns in density-dependent processes that are invariant to maximum body size and hold in homogeneous laboratory, as well as complex natural environments.","[Hazlerigg, Charles R.

Coupled biophysical models predict that the probability of successful dispersal declines as a function of distance between populations. Estimates of genetic isolation-by-distance and self-recruitment provide indirect support for this prediction. Here, we conduct the first direct test of this prediction, using data from the well-studied system of clown anemonefish (Amphiprion percula) at Kimbe Island, in Papua New Guinea. Amphiprion percula live in small breeding groups that inhabit sea anemones. These groups can be thought of as populations within a metapopulation. We use the x- and y-coordinates of each anemone to determine the expected distribution of dispersal distances (the distribution of distances between each and every population in the metapopulation). We use parentage analyses to trace recruits back to parents and determine the observed distribution of dispersal distances. Then, we employ a logistic model to (i) compare the observed and expected dispersal distance distributions and (ii) determine the relationship between the probability of successful dispersal and the distance between populations. The observed and expected dispersal distance distributions are significantly different (p < 0.0001). Remarkably, the probability of successful dispersal between populations decreases fivefold over 1 km.

To do this, we examined an entire year of import records of marine tropical fish entering the United States in detail, and discuss the relationship between trade volume, biodiversity and introduction of non-native marine fishes. Our analyses showed that biodiversity levels are higher than previous estimates. Additionally, more than half of government importation forms have numerical or other reporting discrepancies resulting in the overestimation of trade volumes by 27%. While some commonly imported species have been introduced into the coastal waters of the USA (as expected), we also found that some uncommon species in the trade have also been introduced. This is the first study of aquarium trade imports to compare commercial invoices to government forms and provides a means to, routinely and in real time, examine the biodiversity of the trade in coral reef wildlife species.","[Rhyne, Andrew L.; Tlusty, Michael F.; Kaufman, Les] New England Aquarium, Res Dept, Boston, MA USA; [Rhyne, Andrew L.] Roger Williams Univ, Dept Biol & Marine Biol, Bristol, RI 02809 USA; [Schofield, Pamela J.] United States Geol Survey, SE Ecol Sci Ctr, Gainesville, FL USA; [Kaufman, Les] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, Boston Univ Marine Program, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Kaufman, Les] Conservat Int, Arlington, VA USA; [Morris, James A., Jr.] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Natl Ocean Serv, Natl Ctr Coastal Ocean Sci, Beaufort, NC USA; [Bruckner, Andrew W.] Khaled Bin Sultan Living Oceans Fdn, Landover, MD USA",73,10.1371/journal.pone.0035808,2012

Currently, the Coral Sea area and its seamounts (north-east Australia) are under review to determine if MPAs are warranted. The protection of sharks at these seamounts should be an integral component of conservation plans. Therefore, knowledge on the spatial ecology of sharks at the Coral Sea seamounts is essential for the appropriate implementation of management and conservation plans. Acoustic telemetry was used to determine residency, site fidelity and spatial use of three shark species at Osprey Reef: whitetip reef sharks Triaenodon obesus, grey reef sharks Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos and silvertip sharks Carcharhinus albimarginatus. Most individuals showed year round residency at Osprey Reef, although five of the 49 individuals tagged moved to the neighbouring Shark Reef (similar to 14 km away) and one grey reef shark completed a round trip of similar to 250 km to the Great Barrier Reef. Additionally, individuals of white tip and grey reef sharks showed strong site fidelity to the areas they were tagged, and there was low spatial overlap between groups of sharks tagged at different locations. Spatial use at Osprey Reef by adult sharks is generally restricted to the north-west corner. The high residency and limited spatial use of Osprey Reef suggests that reef sharks would be highly vulnerable to targeted fishing pressure and that MPAs incorporating no-take of sharks would be effective in protecting reef shark populations at Osprey and Shark Reef.","[Barnett, Adam] Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Fisheries Aquaculture & Coasts Ctr, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Abrantes, Katya G.; Seymour, Jamie; Fitzpatrick, Richard] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Cairns, Qld, Australia; [Barnett, Adam; Fitzpatrick, Richard] Reef Channel, Townsville, Qld, Australia",55,10.1371/journal.pone.0036574,2012

This province is also characterized by many islands and a complex bathymetry that induces specific current circulation patterns with the potential to create a high degree of interaction between coastal and oceanic ecosystems. Based on a large dataset of oceanic predator stomach contents, our study used generalized linear models to explore the coastal-oceanic system interaction by analyzing predator-prey relationship. We show that reef organisms are a frequent prey of oceanic predators. Predator species such as albacore (Thunnus alalunga) and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) frequently consume reef prey with higher probability of consumption closer to land and in the western part of the Pacific Ocean. For surface-caught-predators consuming reef prey, this prey type represents about one third of the diet of predators smaller than 50 cm. The proportion decreases with increasing fish size. For predators caught at depth and consuming reef prey, the proportion varies with predator species but generally represents less than 10%. The annual consumption of reef prey by the yellowfin tuna population was estimated at 0.8 +/- 0.40CV million tonnes or 2.17x10(12)+/- 0.40CV individuals. This represents 6.1%+/- 60.17CV in weight of their diet.

Gear-based management, although under represented and under studied, has the potential to be adaptive, address multiple objectives, and be crafted to the socio-economic setting. Management effectiveness in seagrass and coral reef fisheries has generally been evaluated at the scale of the fish community. However, community level indicators can mask species-specific declines that provide significant portions of the fisheries yields and income. Using a unique dataset, containing ten years of species level length frequency catch data from a multi-gear, multi-species seagrass and coral reef fishery in Kenya, we evaluate species specific fishery statuses, compare gear use to gear regulations and estimate the potential needs for further gear restrictions. Despite the high diversity of the fishery, fifteen species represented over 90% of the catch, and only three species represented 60% of the catch. The three most abundant species in the catch, Lethrinus lentjan (Lacepede), Siganus sutor (Valenciennes) and Leptoscarus vaigiensis (Quoy & Gaimard) all showed evidence of growth overfishing. Lethrinus lentjan, with an exploitation rate of 0.82, also shows evidence of recruitment overfishing. Current legal but weakly enforced gear restrictions are capable of protecting a significant portion of the catch up to maturity but optimization of yield will require that the current mesh size be increased from 6.3 to 8.8 and 9.2 cm to increase yields of L. lentjan and S. sutor, respectively. Given the difficulties of enforcing mesh size, we recommend that the economic benefits of these larger mesh sizes be communicated and enforced through co-management.

Species distributions varied considerably amongst taxonomic groups; parrotfishes were mostly widespread whilst distributions of surgeonfishes were often restricted. Most inshore environments supported depauperate herbivore assemblages dominated by different taxa and functional groups compared with assemblages in offshore environments. There were also strong cross-shelf transitions in the main taxa performing each functional role. Overall, this study show that the functional contributions of herbivorous fish assemblages to important ecosystem processes and the contributing taxa vary considerably amongst different GBR environments.

Sampling was conducted in visited and not visited caves to assess whether diving activities have a significant effect on cave habitats, what are the components of biodiversity most affected by this disturbance, and its potential effects on spatial heterogeneity of benthic assemblages. Results clearly showed that human visitation could significantly affect spatial patterns of benthic assemblages. Organisms with erect growth forms were significantly more abundant and homogeneously distributed where diving activities are forbidden. An increase in the small-scale heterogeneity of assemblages and a decrease in their three-dimensional structure could be the ultimate consequences of human visitation.

Addressing this problem requires the use of novel approaches capable of capturing the inherent variability in the mechanisms involved. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study we test whether dispersal and connectivity patterns generated from a biophysical model of larval dispersal of the crab Carcinus maenas, along the west coast of the Iberian Peninsula, can predict the highly variable daily pattern of wind-driven larval supply to an estuary observed during the peak reproductive season (March-June) in 2006 and 2007. Cross-correlations between observed and predicted supply were significant (p < 0.05) and strong, ranging from 0.34 to 0.81 at time lags of -6 to + 5 d. Importantly, the model correctly predicted observed cross-shelf distributions (Pearson r = 0.82, p < 0.001, and r = 0.79, p < 0.01, in 2006 and 2007) and indicated that all supply events were comprised of larvae that had been retained within the inner shelf; larvae transported to the outer shelf and beyond never recruited. Estimated average dispersal distances ranged from 57 to 198 km and were only marginally affected by mortality. Conclusions/Significance: The high degree of predicted demographic connectivity over relatively large geographic scales is consistent with the lack of genetic structuring in C. maenas along the Iberian Peninsula. These findings indicate that the dynamic nature of larval dispersal can be captured by mechanistic biophysical models, which can be used to provide meaningful predictions of the patterns and causes of fine-scale variability in larval supply to marine populations.","[Domingues, Carla P.; Nolasco, Rita; Dubert, Jesus; Queiroga, Henrique] Univ Aveiro, Ctr Estudos Ambiente & Mar CESAM, P-3800 Aveiro, Portugal; [Domingues, Carla P.; Queiroga, Henrique] Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, P-3800 Aveiro, Portugal; [Nolasco, Rita; Dubert, Jesus] Univ Aveiro, Dept Fis, P-3800 Aveiro, Portugal",19,10.1371/journal.pone.0035794,2012

Based on these fish abundance data, we infer the potential impact on four key functional roles performed by parrotfishes. Rates of bioerosion and coral predation are highly sensitive to human activity, whereas grazing and sediment removal are resilient to fishing. Our results offer new insights into the vulnerability and resilience of coral reefs to the ever-growing human footprint.

Rhodolith beds stand with kelp beds, seagrass meadows, and coralline algal reefs as one of the world's four largest macrophyte-dominated benthic communities. Geographic distribution of rhodolith beds is discontinuous, with large concentrations off Japan, Australia and the Gulf of California, as well as in the Mediterranean, North Atlantic, eastern Caribbean and Brazil. Although there are major gaps in terms of seabed habitat mapping, the largest rhodolith beds are purported to occur off Brazil, where these communities are recorded across a wide latitudinal range (2 degrees N - 27 degrees S). To quantify their extent, we carried out an inter-reefal seabed habitat survey on the Abrolhos Shelf (16 degrees 50' - 19 degrees 45'S) off eastern Brazil, and confirmed the most expansive and contiguous rhodolith bed in the world, covering about 20,900 km(2). Distribution, extent, composition and structure of this bed were assessed with side scan sonar, remotely operated vehicles, and SCUBA. The mean rate of CaCO3 production was estimated from in situ growth assays at 1.07 kg m(-2) yr(-1), with a total production rate of 0.025 Gt yr(-1), comparable to those of the world's largest biogenic CaCO3 deposits. These gigantic rhodolith beds, of areal extent equivalent to the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, are a critical, yet poorly understood component of the tropical South Atlantic Ocean.

A variety of benthic species, particularly decapods, provide benefits to their coral host enabling them to cope with environmental stressors, and as a result benefit the overall diversity of coral-associated species. However, little is known about how invertebrate assemblages associated with corals will be affected by global perturbations, (either directly or indirectly via their coral host) or their consequences for ecosystem resilience. Analysis of a ten year dataset reveals that the greatest perturbation at Moorea over this time was an outbreak of the corallivorous sea star Acanthaster planci from 2006 to 2009 impacting habitat health, availability and size structure of Pocillopora spp. populations and highlights a positive relationship between coral head size and survival. We then present the results of a mensurative study in 2009 conducted at the end of the perturbation (A. planci outbreak) describing how coral-decapod communities change with percent coral mortality for a selected coral species, Pocillopora eydouxi. The loss of coral tissue as a consequence of A. planci consumption led to an increase in rarefied total species diversity, but caused drastic modifications in community composition driven by a shift from coral obligate to non-obligate decapod species. Our study highlights that larger corals left with live tissue in 2009, formed a restricted habitat where coral obligate decapods, including mutualists, could subsist. We conclude that the size structure of Pocillopora populations at the time of an A. planci outbreak may greatly condition the magnitude of coral mortality as well as the persistence of local populations of obligate decapods.","[Leray, Matthieu; Beraud, Maxime; Mills, Suzanne C.] Univ Perpignan, CBETM, USR CRIOBE CNRS EPHE 3278, Lab Excellence CORAIL, F-66025 Perpignan, France; [Anker, Arthur] Univ Fed Ceara, Lab Ciencias Mar Labomar, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil; [Chancerelle, Yannick] CRIOBE, USR CRIOBE CNRS EPHE 3278, Lab Excellence CORAIL, Moorea, Fr Polynesia",21,10.1371/journal.pone.0035456,2012

Every one of these 14 traditional chromodorid genera are either non-monophyletic, or render another genus paraphyletic. Additionally, both the monotypic genera Verconia and Diversidoris are nested within clades. Based on data shown here, there are three individual species and five clades limited to the eastern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (or just one of these ocean regions), while the majority of chromodorid clades and species are strictly Indo-Pacific in distribution.

Temporal patterns of predation risk have been shown to drive daily activity and foraging patterns in prey. Yet the ability to respond to temporal patterns of predation risk in environments inhabited by highly diverse predator communities, such as rainforests and coral reefs, has received surprisingly little attention. In this study, we investigated whether juvenile marine fish, Pomacentrus moluccensis (lemon damselfish), have the ability to learn to adjust the intensity of their antipredator response to match the daily temporal patterns of predation risk they experience. Groups of lemon damselfish were exposed to one of two predictable temporal risk patterns for six days. ""Morning risk"" treatment prey were exposed to the odour of Cephalopholis cyanostigma (rockcod) paired with conspecific chemical alarm cues (simulating a rockcod present and feeding) during the morning, and rockcod odour only in the evening (simulating a rockcod present but not feeding). ""Evening risk"" treatment prey had the two stimuli presented to them in the opposite order. When tested individually for their response to rockcod odour alone, lemon damselfish from the morning risk treatment responded with a greater antipredator response intensity in the morning than in the evening. In contrast, those lemon damselfish previously exposed to the evening risk treatment subsequently responded with a greater antipredator response when tested in the evening. The results of this experiment demonstrate that P. moluccensis have the ability to learn temporal patterns of predation risk and can adjust their foraging patterns to match the threat posed by predators at a given time of day. Our results provide the first experimental demonstration of a mechanism by which prey in a complex, multi-predator environment can learn and respond to daily patterns of predation risk.","[Bosiger, Yoland J.; Lonnstedt, Oona M.; McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Bosiger, Yoland J.; Lonnstedt, Oona M.; McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Ferrari, Maud C.

The comprehension of the mechanisms that initiated this pattern is in its infancy despite its importance for the conservation of coral reefs. Considering the IMPA either as an area of overlap or a cradle of marine biodiversity, the hypotheses proposed to account for this pattern rely on extant knowledge about taxonomy and species range distribution. The recent large-scale use of standard molecular data (DNA barcoding), however, has revealed the importance of taking into account cryptic diversity when assessing tropical biodiversity. We DNA barcoded 2276 specimens belonging to 668 coral reef fish species through a collaborative effort conducted concomitantly in both Indian and Pacific oceans to appraise the importance of cryptic diversity in species with an Indo-Pacific distribution range. Of the 141 species sampled on each side of the IMPA, 62 presented no spatial structure whereas 67 exhibited divergent lineages on each side of the IMPA with K2P distances ranging between 1% and 12%, and 12 presented several lineages with K2P distances ranging between 3% and 22%. Thus, from this initial pool of 141 nominal species with Indo-Pacific distribution, 79 dissolved into 165 biological units among which 162 were found in a single ocean. This result is consistent with the view that the IMPA accumulates diversity as a consequence of its geological history, its location on the junction between the two main tropical oceans and the presence of a land bridge during glacial times in the IMPA that fostered allopatric divergence and secondary contacts between the Indian and Pacific oceans.","[Hubert, Nicolas; Bruggemann, Henrich J.] Univ La Reunion, Lab ECOMAR, Fac Sci & Technol, St Denis, Reunion, France; [Hubert, Nicolas; Espiau, Benoit; Planes, Serge] Univ Perpignan, CNRS EPHE, CRIOBE CBETM, F-66025 Perpignan, France; [Meyer, Christopher P.] Smithsonian Inst, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Washington, DC 20560 USA; [Guerin, Fabien] Univ La Reunion, UMR PVBMT, Fac Sci & Technol, St Denis, Reunion, France; [Komeno, Roberto J.

Taking advantage of the natural features of the southeast coast of New Zealand's North Island, we deployed a series of settlement stations and conducted plankton tows to capture recent settlers and planktonic larvae of the common intertidal gastropod Austrolittorina cincta (6-8 week larval period). Satellite image analysis and ground truthing surveys revealed the absence of suitable intertidal rocky shore habitat for A. cincta over a 100 km stretch of coastline between Kapiti Island to the south and Wanganui to the north. Fifteen settlement stations (3 replicates x 5 sites), which were used to mimic intertidal habitat suitable for A. cincta, were deployed for two months around and north of Kapiti Island (at 0.5, 1, 5, 15, 50 km). In addition, we also conducted plankton tows at each settlement station when the stations were first deployed to collect A. cincta larvae in the water column. On collection, all newly settled gastropods and larvae in the plankton samples were individually isolated, and a species-specific microsatellite marker was used to positively identify A. cincta individuals. Most of the positively identified A. cincta settlers and larvae were collected at the first three sampling stations (< 5 km). However, low numbers of A. cincta settlers and larvae were also recorded at the two more distant locations (15 and 50 km). Dispersal curves modeled from our data suggested that < 1% of gastropod larvae would travel more than 100 km. While our data show that most larvae are retained close to their natal populations (< 5 km), a small proportion of larvae are able to travel much larger geographic distances. Our estimates of larval dispersal and subsequent settlement are one of only a few for marine species with a long-lived larva.","[Salinas-de-Leon, Pelayo; Jones, Timothy; Bell, James J.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington, New Zealand",4,10.1371/journal.pone.0032788,2012

There is some support for the hypothesis that carcharhinid species that complete their life-cycle within coral reef ecosystems, hereafter referred to as ""reef sharks'', are more abundant inside no-take marine reserves due to a reduction in fishing pressure (i.e., they benefit from marine reserves). Key predictions of this hypothesis are that (a) individual reef sharks exhibit high site-fidelity to these protected areas and (b) their relative abundance will generally be higher in these areas compared to fished reefs. To test this hypothesis for the first time in Caribbean coral reef ecosystems we combined acoustic monitoring and baited remote underwater video (BRUV) surveys to measure reef shark site-fidelity and relative abundance, respectively. We focused on the Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezi), the most common reef shark in the Western Atlantic, at Glover's Reef Marine Reserve (GRMR), Belize. Acoustically tagged sharks (N = 34) were detected throughout the year at this location and exhibited strong site-fidelity. Shark presence or absence on 200 BRUVs deployed at GRMR and three other sites (another reserve site and two fished reefs) showed that the factor ""marine reserve'' had a significant positive effect on reef shark presence. We rejected environmental factors or site-environment interactions as predominant drivers of this pattern. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that marine reserves can benefit reef shark populations and we suggest new hypotheses to determine the underlying mechanism(s) involved: reduced fishing mortality or enhanced prey availability.","[Bond, Mark E.; Pikitch, Ellen K.; Chapman, Demian D.] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Inst Ocean Conservat Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Babcock, Elizabeth A.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Abercrombie, Debra L.] Port Jefferson Stn, New York, NY USA; [Lamb, Norlan F.] Absolondna, Dangriga, Belize",71,10.1371/journal.pone.0032983,2012

However, ex situ preservation practices can provide safeguards for coral reef conservation. Specifically, modern advances in cryobiology and genome banking could secure existing species and genetic diversity until genotypes can be introduced into rehabilitated habitats. We assessed the feasibility of recovering viable sperm and embryonic cells post-thaw from two coral species, Acropora palmata and Fungia scutaria that have diffferent evolutionary histories, ecological niches and reproductive strategies. In vitro fertilization (IVF) of conspecific eggs using fresh (control) spermatozoa revealed high levels of fertilization (> 90% in A. palmata;> 84% in F. scutaria; P > 0.05) that were unaffected by tested sperm concentrations. A solution of 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at cooling rates of 20 to 30 degrees C/min most successfully cryopreserved both A. palmata and F. scutaria spermatozoa and allowed producing developing larvae in vitro. IVF success under these conditions was 65% in A. palmata and 53% in F. scutaria on particular nights; however, on subsequent nights, the same process resulted in little or no IVF success. Thus, the window for optimal freezing of high quality spermatozoa was short (similar to 5 h for one night each spawning cycle). Additionally, cryopreserved F. scutaria embryonic cells had, 50% post-thaw viability as measured by intact membranes. Thus, despite some differences between species, coral spermatozoa and embryonic cells are viable after low temperature (-196 degrees C) storage, preservation and thawing. Based on these results, we have begun systematically banking coral spermatozoa and embryonic cells on a large-scale as a support approach for preserving existing bio- and genetic diversity found in reef systems.","[Hagedorn, Mary; Carter, Virginia; Martorana, Kelly; Paresa, Malia K.; Wildt, David] Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, Dept Reprod Sci, Front Royal, VA USA; [Hagedorn, Mary; Carter, Virginia; Martorana, Kelly; Paresa, Malia K.; Leong, Jo-Ann] Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI USA; [Acker, Jason] Univ Alberta, Lab Med & Pathol, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Baums, Iliana B.] Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Borneman, Eric] Univ Houston, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX USA; [Brittsan, Michael] Columbus Zoo & Aquarium, Powell, OH USA; [Byers, Michael; Woods, Erik] Gen BioTechnol, Indianapolis, IN USA; [Henley, Michael] Smithsonian Natl Zool Pk, Invertebrate Exhibit, Washington, DC USA; [Laterveer, Michael; Petersen, Dirk] Rotterdam Zoo, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [McCarthy, Megan; Meyers, Stuart] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Anat Physiol & Cell Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Nelson, Brian D.] Cent Wharf, New England Aquarium, Dept Fishes, Boston, MA USA; [Tiersch, Terrence; Uribe, Rafael Cuevas] Louisiana State Univ, Ctr Agr, Aquaculture Res Stn, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",21,10.1371/journal.pone.0033354,2012

Here we document the response of native fish communities to predation by lionfish populations on nine coral reefs off New Providence Island, Bahamas. We assessed lionfish diet through stomach contents analysis, and quantified changes in fish biomass through visual surveys of lionfish and native fishes at the sites over time. Lionfish abundance increased rapidly between 2004 and 2010, by which time lionfish comprised nearly 40% of the total predator biomass in the system. The increase in lionfish abundance coincided with a 65% decline in the biomass of the lionfish's 42 Atlantic prey fishes in just two years.

Deciphering principle patterns of bacterial community variation over multiple spatial scales may however prove critical for a better understanding of factors contributing to cold-water coral reef stability and functioning. Methodology/Principal Findings: Bacterial community structure, as determined by Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (ARISA), was investigated with respect to (i) microbial habitat type and (ii) coral species and color, as well as the three spatial components (iii) geomorphologic reef zoning, (iv) reef boundary, and (v) reef location. Communities revealed fundamental differences between coral-generated (branch surface, mucus) and ambient microbial habitats (seawater, sediments). This habitat specificity appeared pivotal for determining bacterial community shifts over all other study levels investigated. Coral-derived surfaces showed species-specific patterns, differing significantly between Lophelia pertusa and Madrepora oculata, but not between L. pertusa color types. Within the reef center, no community distinction corresponded to geomorphologic reef zoning for both coral-generated and ambient microbial habitats. Beyond the reef center, however, bacterial communities varied considerably from local to regional scales, with marked shifts toward the reef periphery as well as between different in-and offshore reef sites, suggesting significant biogeographic imprinting but weak microbe-host specificity. Conclusions/Significance: This study presents the first multi-scale survey of bacterial diversity in cold-water coral reefs, spanning a total of five observational levels including three spatial scales. It demonstrates that bacterial communities in cold-water coral reefs are structured by multiple factors acting at different spatial scales, which has fundamental implications for the monitoring of microbial diversity and function in those ecosystems.","[Schoettner, Sandra; Boetius, Antje; Ramette, Alban] Max Planck Inst Marine Microbiol, HGF MPG Joint Res Grp Deep Sea Ecol & Technol, Bremen, Germany; [Wild, Christian] Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Ecol, Coral Reef Ecol Grp, Bremen, Germany; [Hoffmann, Friederike] Univ Bergen, Ctr Geobiol, Bergen, Norway; [Hoffmann, Friederike] Uni Res AS, Uni Environm, Bergen, Norway",19,10.1371/journal.pone.0032093,2012

At night, on the reef, C. microrhinos were found to maintain a consistent average peritoneal cavity temperature 0.16 +/- 0.005 degrees C (SE) warmer than ambient. Diurnal internal temperatures were highly variable for individuals monitored on the reef, while in tank-based trials, peritoneal cavity temperatures tracked environmental temperatures. The mechanisms responsible for a departure of the peritoneal cavity temperature from environmental temperature occurred in C. microrhinos are not yet understood. However, the diet and behavior of the species suggests that heat in the peritoneal cavity may result primarily from endogenous thermogenesis coupled with physiological heat retention mechanisms. The presence of limited endothermy in C. microrhinos indicates that a degree of uncertainty may exist in the manner that reef fish respond to their thermal environment.

The focus of this study was two-fold, to: (1) assess how the impact of Degree-Heating-Month (DHM) thermal stress threshold choice affects potential bleaching predictions and (2) examine the effect of hypothetical adaptation rates of corals to rising temperature. DHM values were estimated using a conventional threshold of 1 degrees C and a variability-based threshold of 2 sigma above the climatological maximum Coral adaptation rates were simulated as a function of historical 100-year exposure to maximum annual SSTs with a dynamic rather than static climatological maximum based on the previous 100 years, for a given reef cell. Within CCSM3 simulations, the 1 degrees C threshold predicted later onset of mild bleaching every 5 years for the fraction of reef grid cells where 1 degrees C > 2 sigma of the climatology time series of annual SST maxima (1961-1990). Alternatively, DHM values using both thresholds, with CSIRO MK 3.5 and GFDL CM 2.1 SSTs, did not produce drastically different onset timing for bleaching every 5 years. Across models, DHMs based on 1 degrees C thermal stress threshold show the most threatened reefs by 2100 could be in the Central and Western Equatorial Pacific, whereas use of the variability- based threshold for DHMs yields the Coral Triangle and parts of Micronesia and Melanesia as bleaching hot-spots. Simulations that allow corals to adapt to increases in maximum SST drastically reduce the rates of bleaching. These findings highlight the importance of considering the thermal stress threshold in DHM estimates as well as potential adaptation models in future coral bleaching projections.","[Teneva, Lida] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Karnauskas, Mandy] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Logan, Cheryl A.] Princeton Univ, Atmospher & Ocean Sci Dept, Princeton, NJ 08542 USA; [Bianucci, Laura] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Oceanog, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada; [Currie, Jock C.] Univ Cape Town, Dept Zool, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa; [Kleypas, Joan A.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",29,10.1007/s00338-011-0812-9,2012

We approach this problem by comparing catch-based datasets from market landings across Micronesia to evaluate fishery status in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), Guam, Yap, and Pohnpei. Initial examinations found that calm weather and low lunar illumination predicted between 6% (Yap) and 30% (CNMI) of the variances in daily commercial landings. Both environmentally driven catch success and daily catch variability increased in accordance with reef-fish demand indices. Subsequent insight from species composition and size-at-capture data supported these findings, highlighting reduced trophic levels and capture sizes where higher human-population-per-reef-area existed. Among the 12-15 target species and/or species complexes that accounted for 70% of the harvest biomass, capture sizes were consistently smallest for CNMI and Guam, often below the reported mean reproductive sizes. Comparatively, Pohnpei has the greatest potential for reef fisheries, with a large reef area (303 km(2)) and a moderate human population (34,000 people). However, the estimated harvest volume of 476 mt year(-1) was 8-9 times higher than other jurisdictions. Even on Yap where the reef-fish demand index was lowest (67.7 people km(-2) reef habitat), many target fish were harvested below their mean reproductive sizes, including the iconic green bumphead parrotfish and humphead wrasse, as well as several other herbivores. We discuss our results with respect to the contemporary doctrine surrounding size-spectra, catch composition, and catch frequencies that afford insight into fishery pressure and status. We posit that regional catch-based policies (initially) instituted at the market level, combined with area and gear-based restrictions, represent plausible vectors for improving Micronesian fisheries.","[Rhodes, K.] Univ Hawaii, Coll Agr Forestry & Nat Resource Management, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [Cuetos-Bueno, J.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Lindfield, S.] Univ Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Lindfield, S.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [McIlwain, J.

The Late Pleistocene surface decreases at least 9.25 m (based on reef crest elevations) in elevation over 15 km along a 0.62 m/km eastward (alongshore) slope. Neither differential erosion nor a naturally sloping deposit is likely, thus the directional elevation decrease requires the influence of tectonic processes. Platform tilting or differential subsidence increasing in rate to the east probably operated both during and since the last interglacial and created progressively greater accommodation space for increasingly thicker overlying Holocene reefs in an eastward direction. Rates of subsidence since MIS 5.5 increase from west to east, from 0.02 mm/year to 0.1 mm/year, assuming a MIS 5.5 +6-m sea level and +4 m initial reef elevation. St. Croix's association with extensional shelf faulting from the northern part of the Virgin Islands Basin, the Anegada Fault to the east and the Puerto Rico Trench to the north may be significant in terms of identifying mechanisms for, or past events resulting in, directional tilting.

This study combined acoustic telemetry and ecological assessments to evaluate the movement patterns and feeding range of a functionally important coral reef fish, Chlorurus microrhinos (f. Labridae). The diurnal home range and feeding areas of C. microrhinos, on Orpheus Island, Great Barrier Reef, were quantified using active acoustic telemetry. The average diurnal home range of C. microrhinos was 7,830 m(2) +/- 940 (SE). Core areas of activity (50% kernel utilization distributions) were relatively small, encompassing approximately 22% of an individual's home range (1,690 m(2) +/- 220). Core areas exhibited greater topographic complexity. C. microrhinos may select these areas because of decreased predation risk. Feeding intensities were not homogenous throughout the home range. Core areas were found to have a greater number of feeding scars and are thus exposed to increased bioerosion and algal removal by C. microrhinos.

We explored relationships amongst an individual's size and sex, the distance and frequency it migrated from its feeding area to spawning sites, fidelity to particular spawning sites and the number of individuals that aggregated to spawn. In order to achieve this, 406 C. striatus were captured and tagged on inshore reefs in Kimbe Bay (5 degrees 30'S 150 degrees 6'E), New Britain, Papua New Guinea. Tagged individuals were consistently observed within spatially discrete but overlapping feeding areas (maximum diameter averaging <13 m). The mean distance migrated was 58 m (ranging from 2 to 291 m). No tagged individuals were witnessed spawning at more than one site. Whilst most individuals (n = 88) migrated to the spawning site that was closest to their feeding areas, those that migrated to sites further away (n = 9) always spawned at sites where the number of conspecifics aggregating was larger. Neither the size nor the sex of individuals limited migration distance. However, males migrated significantly more frequently than females (on average once every 2 days vs. once every 3 days), and migration frequency was positively correlated with size in females. Migration distance did not affect the frequency with which individuals spawned.

Understanding their distribution and building predictive models of community composition as a function of environmental variables therefore constitutes a key issue for resource management. The goal of this study was to define and classify the main environmental factors influencing tropical invertebrate distributions in New Caledonian reef flats and to test the resulting predictive model. Invertebrate assemblages were sampled by visual counting during 2 years and 2 seasons, then coupled to different environmental conditions (habitat composition, hydrodynamics and sediment characteristics) and harvesting status (MPA vs. non-MPA and islets vs. coastal flats). Environmental conditions were described by a principal component analysis (PCA), and contributing variables were selected. Permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was used to test the effects of different factors (status, flat, year and season) on the invertebrate assemblage composition. Multivariate regression trees (MRT) were then used to hierarchically classify the effects of environmental and harvesting variables.

These reefs represent a relatively unique combination within the wider Caribbean of low coral cover and high parrotfish abundance suggesting that predation pressure could be intense. Surveys across eight shallow forereefs documented the abundance of corals, corallivorous parrotfishes, and predation scars on corals. The corals Porites porites and Porites astreoides were preyed onmost frequently with the rates of predation an order of magnitude greater than has been documented for other areas of the Caribbean. In fact, parrotfish bite density on these preferred corals was up to 34 times greater than reported for corals on other reefs worldwide. On reefs where coral cover was low and corals such as Montastraea faveolata, often preferred prey for parrotfishes, were rare, predation rates on P. porites and P. astreoides, and other less common corals, intensified further. The intensity of parrotfish predation increased significantly as coral cover decreased. However, parrotfish abundance showed only a marginal positive relationship with predation pressure on corals, likely because corallivorous parrotfish were abundant across all reefs. Parrotfishes often have significant positive impacts on coral cover by facilitating coral recruitment, survival, and growth via their grazing of algae. However, abundant corallivorous parrotfishes combined with low coral cover may result in higher predation on corals and intensify the negative impact that parrotfishes have on remaining corals.","Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Marine Sci Program, N Miami, FL 33181 USA",12,10.1007/s00338-011-0824-5,2012

While these models possess fidelity in reproducing many aspects of climate, they vary in their ability to correctly capture such parameters as the tropical ocean seasonal cycle and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability. Such weaknesses most likely reduce the accuracy of predicting coral bleaching, but little attention has been paid to the important issue of understanding potential errors and biases, the interaction of these biases with trends, and their propagation in predictions. To analyze the relative importance of various types of model errors and biases in predicting coral bleaching, various intra-and inter-annual frequency bands of observed SSTs were replaced with those frequencies from 24 GCMs 20th century simulations included in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 4th assessment report. Subsequent thermal stress was calculated and predictions of bleaching were made. These predictions were compared with observations of coral bleaching in the period 1982-2007 to calculate accuracy using an objective measure of forecast quality, the Peirce skill score (PSS). Major findings are that: (1) predictions are most sensitive to the seasonal cycle and inter-annual variability in the ENSO 24-60 months frequency band and (2) because models tend to understate the seasonal cycle at reef locations, they systematically underestimate future bleaching. The methodology we describe can be used to improve the accuracy of bleaching predictions by characterizing the errors and uncertainties involved in the predictions.","[van Hooidonk, R.] NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Huber, M.] Purdue Univ, PCCRC, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",15,10.1007/s00338-011-0825-4,2012

In this study, the effect of trampling on the meiofaunal harpacticoid copepod assemblage inhabiting turfs on a coral reef was investigated. In Porto de Galinhas, northeastern Brazil, reef formations near the beach are one of the main touristic destinations in the country. To assess trampling impact, two areas were compared: a protected area and an area subject to intensive tourism. Densities of total Harpacticoida and of the most abundant harpacticoid species showed strong reductions in the trampled area. An analysis of covariance revealed that the loss of phytal habitat was not the main source of density reductions, showing that trampling affected the animals directly. In addition, multivariate analysis demonstrated differences in the structure of harpacticoid assemblages between areas. Of the 43 species identified, 12 were detected by the Indicator Species Analyses as being indicators of the protected or trampled areas. Moreover, species richness was reduced in the area open to tourism. At least 25 harpacticoids are new species for science, of these, 20 were more abundant or occurred only in the protected area, while five were more abundant or occurred only in the trampled area; thus, our results highlight the possibility of local extinction of still-unknown species as one of the potential consequences of trampling on coral reefs.","[Sarmento, V.

This study provides the first detailed investigation of the diversity of Scleractinia and Octocorallia of the mesophotic Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Specimens were collected by 100-m rock dredge tows at 47-163 m depth on 23 sites in four regions (15.3 degrees--19.7 degrees latitude South). Twenty-nine hard coral species from 19 families were recorded, with the greatest diversity found at <60 m depth, and no specimen was found >102 m. Many of these species are also commonly observed at shallower depths, particularly in inshore areas. Twenty-seven octocoral genera were collected, 25 of which represented azooxanthellate genera. Generic richness of octocorals was highest at depths >60 m. Sixteen of the 25 azooxanthellate genera were either absent or very rare at <18 m, and only five azooxanthellate genera were common on both shallow and mesophotic reefs. Species-area models indicated that the total diversity of hard corals on the deep mesophotic reefs sampled during this study was similar to 84 species while octocorals were represented by similar to 37 genera; however, the wide 95% confidence limits indicates that more intensive sampling effort is required to improve the accuracy of these estimates. Nonetheless, these results show that the taxonomic richness, particularly of hard corals, on mesophotic reefs may be much higher than previously thought, a finding that has implications for the comprehensive and adequate protection of the full range of biodiversity of the GBR.","[Bridge, T.

We measured the distribution and concentrations of urea in seagrass beds, areas of schooling fish, coral formations and bottom sediments in the Upper Florida Keys Reef Tract. The flux of urea from bottom sediments was also measured. Ambient concentrations of urea in the offshore reefs were similar to the concentrations of nitrate and ammonium. Seagrass beds, areas of schooling fish and coral formations had elevated concentrations of urea that were up to eight times higher than nitrate in the system. Numerous ephemeral hotspots of urea that were 8-20 times the ambient urea concentration existed in seagrass beds, areas of schooling fish, and above sediments. Coastal areas and inland canals had high urea concentrations where urban runoff and septic effluents were prevalent, but there was no anthropogenic influence in the offshore habitats. Urea concentrations above bottom sediments were not different from ambient concentrations and benthic flux chamber incubations showed biological activity in carbonaceous sediments but no net urea production. The decrease in urea concentrations from coasts and inland waterways to a consistent ambient concentration in the offshore reef system and ephemeral hotspots of high urea concentration suggest that urea is a dynamic pool of bioavailable nitrogen in the reefs of the Upper Florida Keys.","[Crandall, J.

Recent studies show exposure to elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) impairs olfactory cue recognition in larval reef fishes. However, whether this alters the behaviour of settling fish or disrupts habitat selection is unknown. Here, the effect of elevated CO2 on larval behaviour and habitat selection at settlement was tested in three species of damselfishes (family Pomacentridae) that differ in their pattern of habitat use: Pomacentrus amboinensis (a habitat generalist), Pomacentrus chrysurus (a rubble specialist) and Pomacentrus moluccensis (a live coral specialist). Settlement-stage larvae were exposed to current-day CO2 levels or CO2 concentrations that could occur by 2100 (700 and 850 ppm) based on IPCC emission scenarios. First, pair-wise choice tests were performed using a two-channel flume chamber to test olfactory discrimination between hard coral, soft coral and coral rubble habitats. The habitat selected by settling fish was then compared among treatments using a multichoice settlement experiment conducted overnight. Finally, settlement timing between treatments was compared across two lunar cycles for one of the species, P. chrysurus. Exposure to elevated CO2 disrupted the ability of larvae to discriminate between habitat odours in olfactory trials. However, this had no effect on the habitats selected at settlement when all sensory cues were available. The timing of settlement was dramatically altered by CO2 exposure, with control fish exhibiting peak settlement around the new moon, whereas fish exposed to 850 ppm CO2 displaying highest settlement rates around the full moon. These results suggest larvae can rely on other sensory information, such as visual cues, to compensate for impaired olfactory ability when selecting settlement habitat at small spatial scales. However, rising CO2 could cause larvae to settle at unfavourable times, with potential consequences for larval survival and population replenishment.","[Devine, B. M.; Munday, P. L.; Jones, G.

Numerous calcifying organisms, including reef-building corals, may be severely impacted by declining aragonite and calcite saturation, but the fate of coral reef ecosystems in response to ocean acidification remains largely unexplored. Naturally low saturation (Omega similar to 0.5) low pH (6.70-7.30) groundwater has been discharging for millennia at localized submarine springs (called ""ojos"") at Puerto Morelos, Mexico near the Mesoamerican Reef. This ecosystem provides insights into potential long term responses of coral ecosystems to low saturation conditions. In-situ chemical and biological data indicate that both coral species richness and coral colony size decline with increasing proximity to low-saturation, low-pH waters at the ojo centers. Only three scleractinian coral species (Porites astreoides, Porites divaricata, and Siderastrea radians) occur in undersaturated waters at all ojos examined. Because these three species are rarely major contributors to Caribbean reef framework, these data may indicate that today's more complex frame-building species may be replaced by smaller, possibly patchy, colonies of only a few species along the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef. The growth of these scleractinian coral species at undersaturated conditions illustrates that the response to ocean acidification is likely to vary across species and environments; thus, our data emphasize the need to better understand the mechanisms of calcification to more accurately predict future impacts of ocean acidification.","[Crook, E.

However, the mechanism driving this density-dependent mortality is poorly understood, but may be caused by changes in a predator's feeding rate at different prey densities (its functional response). An aquarium experiment replicated in winter and summer examined the functional response after 22 and 47 h of Cephalopholis cruentata feeding on Halichoeres pictus. With the exception of summer data after 47 h (density-independent mortality), mortality was inversely density dependent across all prey densities and increased with higher summer temperatures. The absence of an asymptotic pattern of inverse density-dependent mortality was caused by type II (summer) or dome-shaped type IV (winter) functional responses, with the benefits of schooling likely to cause the low mortality rates at higher prey densities. Predators' functional responses may underlie the inverse density-dependent mortality reported in field studies of aggregating fishes.","[Harborne, A.

Consequently, the ability to assess predation risk when selecting a settlement site can be critical to survival. In this study, pairwise choice trials were used to determine whether larvae of three species of anemonefish (Amphiprion melanopus, A. percula and Premnas biaculeatus) are able to (1) assess the predation risk of potential anemone settlement sites through olfactory cues alone and (2) alter their settlement choices depending on the options available (host or non-host anemone). When predation risk was assessed with host and non-host anemone species independently, all species of anemonefish significantly chose the odor associated with the low-risk settlement option over the high-risk site. Most importantly, all species of anemonefish selected water with olfactory cues from their host anemone regardless of predation risk when paired against non-host anemone odor. These results demonstrate that larval reef fishes can use olfactory cues for complex risk assessment during settlement-site selection; however, locating the correct habitat is the most important factor when selecting a settlement site.","[Dixson, D.

Here, for the first time, we document the spatial and temporal variation in coral predation by parrotfishes on an inshore reef on the GBR. The densities of parrotfish feeding scars on massive Porites spp. were compared within core and non-core areas of three Chlorurus microrhinos home ranges. The density of parrotfish feeding scars on massive Porites is among the highest recorded on the GBR and elsewhere with a higher abundance of excavating feeding scars within core areas, reflecting the higher occupancy of these areas by C. microrhinos. Furthermore, excavating scars were more abundant in October than in April. This may be related to the higher nutritional quality of coral colonies in October, as coral spawning usually occurs in November at this study location. No spatial or temporal variation was noted in the abundance of feeding scars from scraping parrotfishes. The lack of temporal differences may be a result of the shallow scraping scars which would not be able to reach the gonads within coral polyps. The frequency of parrotfish predation on Porites and the spatial and temporal variation recorded herein highlight the potential importance of parrotfish corallivory on the GBR.","[Bonaldo, R.

Habitat specialists, particularly those associated with susceptible coral species, are clearly among the most vulnerable to population decline or extinction. However, the degree of specialization on coral microhabitats is still unclear for one of the most ubiquitous, abundant and well studied of coral reef fish families-the damselfishes (Pomacentridae). Using high taxonomic resolution surveys of microhabitat use and availability, this study provides the first species-level description of patterns of Acropora selectivity among recruits of 10 damselfish species in order to determine their vulnerability to habitat degradation. In addition, surveys of the bleaching susceptibility of 16 branching coral species revealed which preferred recruitment microhabitats are at highest risk of decline as a result of chronic coral bleaching. Four species (i.e., Chrysiptera parasema, Pomacentrus moluccensis, Dascyllus melanurus and Chromis retrofasciata) were identified as highly vulnerable because they used only branching hard corals as recruitment habitat and primarily associated with only 2-4 coral species. The bleaching surveys revealed that five species of Acropora were highly susceptible to bleaching, with more than 50% of colonies either severely bleached or already dead. These highly susceptible corals included two of the preferred microhabitats of the specialist C. parasema and represented a significant proportion of its total recruitment microhabitat. In contrast, highly susceptible corals were rarely used by another specialist, P. moluccensis, suggesting that this species faces a lower risk of bleaching-induced habitat loss compared to C. parasema. As degradation to coral reef habitats continues, specialists will increasingly be forced to use alternative recruitment microhabitats, and this is likely to reduce population replenishment. Future research should focus on examining the fitness costs of using these alternative microhabitats.","[Bonin, M.

These include common property institutional design principles and their contextual conditions. Using a variety of web-based English keyword searches, published literature on community-based management and co-management of coral reefs was systematically reviewed with the view of determining if and how studies were evaluating these management systems as well as the extent to which critical aspects of common property theory were investigated and tested. Based on a screening of 600 and full evaluation of 157 journal articles, four measures of ecological conditions and five measures of contextual condition improvement were examined or could be evaluated with the data presented in 38 papers, which examined 49 co-management projects. Fewer than half of the 49 studies met the inclusion criteria of the analyses for documenting key design principles or contextual conditions. Additionally, most projects did not systematically report on contextual conditions, common property design principles and measures of success. The analysis demonstrates the large theoretical and empirical gaps in the evaluation of these management systems and begs for a more scientific, critical and multivariate approach.

Observations are generally obtained through Underwater Visual Censuses (UVC) conducted by divers. The problems inherent to the presence of divers have been discussed in several papers. Video techniques are increasingly used for observing underwater macrofauna and habitat. Most video techniques that do not need the presence of a diver use baited remote systems. In this paper, we present an original video technique which relies on a remote unbaited rotating remote system including a high definition camera. The system is set on the sea floor to record images. These are then analysed at the office to quantify biotic and abiotic sea bottom cover, and to identify and count fish species and other species like marine turtles. The technique was extensively tested in a highly diversified coral reef ecosystem in the South Lagoon of New Caledonia, based on a protocol covering both protected and unprotected areas in major lagoon habitats. The technique enabled to detect and identify a large number of species, and in particular fished species, which were not disturbed by the system. Habitat could easily be investigated through the images. A large number of observations could be carried out per day at sea. This study showed the strong potential of this non obtrusive technique for observing both macrofauna and habitat. It offers a unique spatial coverage and can be implemented at sea at a reasonable cost by non-expert staff.

Although the factors that trigger an initial outbreak may vary, successive outbreaks within and across regions are assumed to spread via the planktonic larvae released from a primary outbreak. This secondary outbreak hypothesis is predominantly based on the high dispersal potential of A. planci and the assertion that outbreak populations (a rogue subset of the larger population) are genetically more similar to each other than they are to low-density non-outbreak populations. Here we use molecular techniques to evaluate the spatial scale at which A. planci outbreaks can propagate via larval dispersal in the central Pacific Ocean by inferring the location and severity of gene flow restrictions from the analysis of mtDNA control region sequence (656 specimens, 17 non-outbreak and six outbreak locations, six archipelagos, and three regions). Substantial regional, archipelagic, and subarchipelagic-scale genetic structuring of A. planci populations indicate that larvae rarely realize their dispersal potential and outbreaks in the central Pacific do not spread across the expanses of open ocean. On a finer scale, genetic partitioning was detected within two of three islands with multiple sampling sites. The finest spatial structure was detected at Pearl & Hermes Atoll, between the lagoon and forereef habitats (<10 km). Despite using a genetic marker capable of revealing subtle partitioning, we found no evidence that outbreaks were a rogue genetic subset of a greater population. Overall, outbreaks that occur at similar times across population partitions are genetically independent and likely due to nutrient inputs and similar climatic and ecological conditions that conspire to fuel plankton blooms.","[Timmers, Molly A.] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm NOAA Fisheries, Coral Reef Ecosyst Div, Joint Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Honolulu, HI USA; [Bird, Christopher E.; Skillings, Derek J.; Toonen, Robert J.] Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Kaneohe, HI USA; [Skillings, Derek J.] Univ Hawaii, Dept Zool, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Smouse, Peter E.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA",37,10.1371/journal.pone.0031159,2012

To assist this process, we compare four methods for marine spatial planning of Madagascar's west coast. Input data for each method was drawn from the same variables: fishing pressure, exposure to climate change, and biodiversity (habitats, species distributions, biological richness, and biodiversity value). The first method compares visual color classifications of primary variables, the second uses binary combinations of these variables to produce a categorical classification of management actions, the third is a target-based optimization using Marxan, and the fourth is conservation ranking with Zonation. We present results from each method, and compare the latter three approaches for spatial coverage, biodiversity representation, fishing cost and persistence probability. All results included large areas in the north, central, and southern parts of western Madagascar. Achieving 30% representation targets with Marxan required twice the fish catch loss than the categorical method. The categorical classification and Zonation do not consider targets for conservation features. However, when we reduced Marxan targets to 16.3%, matching the representation level of the ""strict protection"" class of the categorical result, the methods show similar catch losses. The management category portfolio has complete coverage, and presents several management recommendations including strict protection. Zonation produces rapid conservation rankings across large, diverse datasets. Marxan is useful for identifying strict protected areas that meet representation targets, and minimize exposure probabilities for conservation features at low economic cost. We show that methods based on Zonation and a simple combination of variables can produce results comparable to Marxan for species representation and catch losses, demonstrating the value of comparing alternative approaches during initial stages of the planning process. Choosing an appropriate approach ultimately depends on scientific and political factors including representation targets, likelihood of adoption, and persistence goals.","[Allnutt, Thomas F.; Baker, Merrill; Kremen, Claire] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [McClanahan, Timothy R.; McClennen, Caleb] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Marine Programs, Bronx, NY USA; [Andrefouet, Serge] Inst Rech Dev, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Lagabrielle, Erwann] Inst Rech Dev, St Clotilde, Reunion, Reunion; [Lagabrielle, Erwann] Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Dept Bot, George, South Africa; [Rakotomanjaka, Andry J.

Otolith chemistry provides an opportunity to investigate dispersal patterns at a number of life history stages. Our aim was to assess patterns of larval and post-settlement (i.e. between settlement and recruitment) dispersal at two different spatial scales in a Mediterranean coastal fish (i.e. white sea bream, Diplodus sargus sargus) using otolith chemistry. At a large spatial scale (similar to 200 km) we investigated natal origin of fish and at a smaller scale (similar to 30 km) we assessed ""site fidelity"" (i.e. post-settlement dispersal until recruitment). Larvae dispersed from three spawning areas, and a single spawning area supplied post-settlers (proxy of larval supply) to sites spread from 100 to 200 km of coastline. Post-settlement dispersal occurred within the scale examined of similar to 30 km, although about a third of post-settlers were recruits in the same sites where they settled. Connectivity was recorded both from a MPA to unprotected areas and vice versa. The approach adopted in the present study provides some of the first quantitative evidence of dispersal at both larval and post-settlement stages of a key species in Mediterranean rocky reefs.

Fishers' adaptive responses to these pressures, such as exiting from a fishery to pursue alternative livelihoods, determine their own vulnerability, as well as the potential for reducing fishing effort and sustaining fisheries. The willingness and ability to make particular adaptations in response to change, such as exiting from a declining fishery, is influenced by economic, cultural and institutional factors operating at scales from individual fishers to national economies. Previous studies of exit from fisheries at single or few sites, offer limited insight into the relative importance of individual and larger-scale social and economic factors. We asked 599 fishers how they would respond to hypothetical scenarios of catch declines in 28 sites in five western Indian Ocean countries. We investigated how socioeconomic variables at the individual-, household- and site-scale affected whether they would exit fisheries. Site-level factors had the greatest influence on readiness to exit, but these relationships were contrary to common predictions. Specifically, higher levels of infrastructure development and economic vitality - expected to promote exit from fisheries - were associated with less readiness to exit. This may be due to site level histories of exit from fisheries, greater specialisation of fishing households, or higher rewards from fishing in more economically developed sites due to technology, market access, catch value and government subsidies. At the individual and household scale, fishers from households with more livelihood activities, and fishers with lower catch value were more willing to exit. These results demonstrate empirically how adaptive responses to change are influenced by factors at multiple scales, and highlight the importance of understanding natural resource-based livelihoods in the context of the wider economy and society.","[Daw, Tim M.; Brown, Katrina] Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Daw, Tim M.] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Cinner, Joshua E.; Graham, Nicholas A.

Larval damselfish exposed to concentrations of CO2 predicted to occur in the mid- to late-century show maladaptive responses to predator cues. However, there is considerable variation both within and between species in CO2 effects, whereby some individuals are unaffected at particular CO2 concentrations while others show maladaptive responses to predator odour. Our goal was to test whether learning via chemical or visual information would be impaired by ocean acidification and ultimately, whether learning can mitigate the effects of ocean acidification by restoring the appropriate responses of prey to predators. Using two highly efficient and widespread mechanisms for predator learning, we compared the behaviour of pre-settlement damselfish Pomacentrus amboinensis that were exposed to 440 mu atm CO2 (current day levels) or 850 mu atm CO2, a concentration predicted to occur in the ocean before the end of this century. We found that, regardless of the method of learning, damselfish exposed to elevated CO2 failed to learn to respond appropriately to a common predator, the dottyback, Pseudochromis fuscus. To determine whether the lack of response was due to a failure in learning or rather a short-term shift in trade-offs preventing the fish from displaying overt antipredator responses, we conditioned 440 or 700 mu atm-CO2 fish to learn to recognize a dottyback as a predator using injured conspecific cues, as in Experiment 1. When tested one day post-conditioning, CO2 exposed fish failed to respond to predator odour. When tested 5 days post-conditioning, CO2 exposed fish still failed to show an antipredator response to the dottyback odour, despite the fact that both control and CO2-treated fish responded to a general risk cue (injured conspecific cues). These results indicate that exposure to CO2 may alter the cognitive ability of juvenile fish and render learning ineffective.","[Ferrari, Maud C.

Cues contributing to the settlement choices and metamorphosis of larvae have important implications for the success of individuals and populations, but cues mediating larval settlement for many marine invertebrates are largely unknown. This study assessed larval settlement in two common Great Barrier Reef sponges, Coscinoderma matthewsi and Rhopaloeides odorabile, to cues that enhance settlement and metamorphosis in various species of scleractinian coral larvae. Methanol extracts of the crustose coralline algae (CCA), Porolithon onkodes, corresponding to a range of concentrations, were used to determine the settlement responses of sponge larvae. Cnidarian neuropeptides (GLW-amide neuropeptides) were also tested as a settlement cue. Settlement in both sponge species was approximately two-fold higher in response to live chips of CCA and optimum concentrations of CCA extract compared to 0.2 mu m filtered sea water controls. Metamorphosis also increased when larvae were exposed to GLW-amide neuropeptides; R. odorabile mean metamorphosis reached 42.0 +/- 5.8% compared to 16.0 +/- 2.4% in seawater controls and in C. matthewsi mean metamorphosis reached 68.3 +/- 5.4% compared to 36.7 +/- 3.3% in seawater controls. These results demonstrate the contributing role chemosensory communication plays in the ability of sponge larvae to identify suitable habitat for successful recruitment.

Since the distribution of many marine species relates to certain habitats and depth regimes, mapping data provide valuable information in the absence of detailed ecological data that can be used to identify and spatially quantify smaller scale (10 s km) coral reef ecosystem regions and potential physical biogeographic barriers. This study focused on the southeast Florida coast due to a recognized, but understudied, tropical to subtropical biogeographic gradient. GIS spatial analyses were conducted on recent, accurate, shallow-water (0-30 m) benthic habitat maps to identify and quantify specific regions along the coast that were statistically distinct in the number and amount of major benthic habitat types. Habitat type and width were measured for 209 evenly-spaced cross-shelf transects. Evaluation of groupings from a cluster analysis at 75% similarity yielded five distinct regions. The number of benthic habitats and their area, width, distance from shore, distance from each other, and LIDAR depths were calculated in GIS and examined to determine regional statistical differences. The number of benthic habitats decreased with increasing latitude from 9 in the south to 4 in the north and many of the habitat metrics statistically differed between regions. Three potential biogeographic barriers were found at the Boca, Hillsboro, and Biscayne boundaries, where specific shallow-water habitats were absent further north; Middle Reef, Inner Reef, and oceanic seagrass beds respectively. The Bahamas Fault Zone boundary was also noted where changes in coastal morphologies occurred that could relate to subtle ecological changes. The analyses defined regions on a smaller scale more appropriate to regional management decisions, hence strengthening marine conservation planning with an objective, scientific foundation for decision making. They provide a framework for similar regional analyses elsewhere.","Nova SE Univ, Natl Coral Reef Inst, Dania, FL USA",17,10.1371/journal.pone.0030466,2012

This hypothesis, based mostly on the prevalence of luminous bacteria in fish guts, has not been tested experimentally. Here we show that zooplankton that contacts and feeds on the luminescent bacterium Photobacterium leiognathi starts to glow, and demonstrate by video recordings that glowing individuals are highly vulnerable to predation by nocturnal fish. Glowing bacteria thereby are transferred to the nutritious guts of fish and zooplankton, where they survive digestion and gain effective means for growth and dispersal.

In the absence of current monitoring or legislation to govern the trade, baseline information regarding the species, number and source location of animals traded is missing despite being critical for its successful management and sustainability. An industry assessment to establish the number and provenance of species of ornamental polychaetes (sabellids and serpulids) traded was undertaken across UK wholesalers and retailers. Six geographical regions exporting fan worms were identified. Singapore contributed the highest percentage of imports, but of only one worm ""type'' whereas Bali, the second largest source, supplied five different worm ""types''. Over 50% of UK retailers were supplied by one wholesaler while the remainder were stocked by a mixture of one other wholesaler and/or direct imports from the source country. We estimate that up to 18,500 ornamental polychaetes (16,980 sabellids and 1,018 serpulids) are sold annually in the UK revealing a drastic underestimation of currently accepted trade figures. Incorrect identification (based on exporting region or visual characteristics) of traded animals exacerbates the inaccuracy in market quantification, although identification of preserved sabellids using published keys proved just as inconclusive with high within-species variability and the potential for new or cryptic species. A re-description of the polychaete groups traded using a combination of molecular and morphological techniques is necessary for effective identification and market quantification. This study provides the first assessment of ornamental polychaetes but more importantly highlights the issues surrounding the collection of baseline information necessary to manage the aquarium trade.

Close reserve habitats also contained fewer prey fish than nonreserve locations. In contrast, fish abundance in isolated reserve habitats did not differ from similar nonreserve locations.

Throughout the Indo-Pacific, reef fish species appear to have few links with estuarine mangrove habitats. In contrast, clear-water non-estuarine mangrove habitats throughout the Caribbean support many reef fish species and may be fundamental for sustaining reef fish populations. But how important are clear-water non-estuarine mangroves for reef fishes within the Indo-Pacific? Using visual surveys during diurnal high tide, the fish assemblages inhabiting clear-water mangrove and adjacent reef habitats of Orpheus Island, Great Barrier Reef, were recorded. Of the 188 species of fishes that were recorded, only 38 were observed to inhabit both habitats. Of these, only eight were observed more than five times within each habitat. These observations provide little indication that the clear-water mangroves are an important habitat for reef fish species. In addition, although based on just a 3-month survey period, we found little evidence to suggest that these areas are important nurseries for reef fish species. The clear-water mangroves of Orpheus Island may, however, provide an additional foraging area for the few reef fish species that were observed to utilize these habitats during high tide. The difference in the importance of clear-water mangroves for reef fishes within this study compared with clear-water mangrove counterparts within the Caribbean is surprising. Although only preliminary, our observations would support suggestions that the patterns reflect the different hydrological characteristics and evolutionary histories of these two biogeographic regions.","[Bellwood, David R.; Tanner, Jennifer K.] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Barnes, Lachlan] Cronulla Fisheries Res Ctr, Cronulla, NSW 2230, Australia; [Bellwood, David R.; Sheaves, Marcus; Tanner, Jennifer K.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",13,10.1007/s00227-011-1801-9,2012

Rather than a ""blue print"" for devising long-enduring institutions, this study relies on the design principles as a starting point to organize an inquiry into the institutional diversity found in customary governance regimes. Three important trends emerged from this comparative analysis: (1) despite it being notoriously difficult to define boundaries around marine resources, almost 3/4 of the cases in this study had clearly defined boundaries and membership; (2) all of the customary institutions were able to make and change rules, indicating a critical degree of flexibility and autonomy that may be necessary for adaptive management; (3) the customary institutions examined generally lacked key interactions with organizations operating at larger scales, suggesting that they may lack the institutional embeddedness required to confront some common pool resources (CPR) challenges from the broader socioeconomic, institutional and political settings in which they are embedded.

Little is known about the large predatory fishes, primarily snappers (subfamily Etelinae) and groupers (subfamily Epinephelinae) that occur at 100-400 m. These long-lived, slow-growing species support fisheries across the Indo-Pacific, yet no comprehensive genetic surveys within this group have been conducted. Here we contribute the first range-wide survey of a deepwater Indo-Pacific snapper, Pristipomoides filamentosus, with special focus on Hawai'i. We applied mtDNA cytochrome b and 11 microsatellite loci to 26 samples (N = 1,222) collected across 17,000 km from Hawai'i to the western Indian Ocean. Results indicate that P. filamentosus is a highly dispersive species with low but significant population structure (mtDNA Phi(ST) = 0.029, microsatellite F-ST = 0.029) due entirely to the isolation of Hawai'i. No population structure was detected across 14,000 km of the Indo-Pacific from Tonga in the Central Pacific to the Seychelles in the western Indian Ocean, a pattern rarely observed in reef species. Despite a long pelagic phase (60-180 days), interisland dispersal as adults, and extensive gene flow across the Indo-Pacific, P. filamentosus is unable to maintain population connectivity with Hawai'i. Coalescent analyses indicate that P. filamentosus may have colonized Hawai'i 26 K-52 K y ago against prevailing currents, with dispersal away from Hawai'i dominating migration estimates. P. filamentosus harbors low genetic diversity in Hawai'i, a common pattern in marine fishes, and our data indicate a single archipelago-wide stock. However, like the Hawaiian Grouper, Hyporthodus quernus, this snapper had several significant pairwise comparisons (F-ST) clustered around the middle of the archipelago (St. Rogatien, Brooks Banks, Gardner) indicating that this region may be isolated or (more likely) receives input from Johnston Atoll to the south.","[Gaither, Michelle R.; Bowen, Brian W.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; [Jones, Shelley A.] Humboldt State Univ, Human Performance Lab, Arcata, CA 95521 USA; [Kelley, Christopher] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Undersea Res Lab, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Newman, Stephen J.] Western Australian Fisheries & Marine Res Labs, Dept Fisheries, North Beach, Australia; [Sorenson, Laurie] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA USA",53,10.1371/journal.pone.0028913,2011

For six out of seven coral species, tissue biomass correlated with Symbiodinium density. Within a particular coral species, tissue biomasses and Symbiodinium densities varied regionally according to the following trends: Mexico >= Florida Keys >= Bahamas. Average tissue biomasses and symbiont cell densities were generally higher in shallow habitats (1-4 m) compared to deeper-dwelling conspecifics (12-15 m). Most colonies that were sampled displayed seasonal fluctuations in biomass and endosymbiont density related to annual temperature variations. During the bleaching episodes of 1998 and 2005, five out of seven species that were exposed to unusually high temperatures exhibited significant decreases in symbiotic algae that, in certain cases, preceded further decreases in tissue biomass. Following bleaching, Montastraea spp. colonies with low relative biomass levels died, whereas colonies with higher biomass levels survived. Bleaching-or disease-associated mortality was also observed in Acropora cervicornis colonies; compared to A. palmata, all A. cervicornis colonies experienced low biomass values. Such patterns suggest that Montastraea spp. and possibly other coral species with relatively low biomass experience increased susceptibility to death following bleaching or other stressors than do conspecifics with higher tissue biomass levels.","[Thornhill, Daniel J.] Defenders Wildlife, Dept Field Conservat, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Thornhill, Daniel J.] Bowdoin Coll, Dept Biol, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA; [Rotjan, Randi D.] New England Aquarium, Edgerton Res Lab, Boston, MA USA; [Todd, Brian D.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Chilcoat, Geoff C.; Kemp, Dustin W.; Reynolds, Jennifer McCabe; Fitt, William K.] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Iglesias-Prieto, Roberto] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Cancun, Mexico; [LaJeunesse, Todd C.] Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Shannon, Thomas] Tulane Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Warner, Mark E.] Univ Delaware, Coll Earth Ocean & Environm, Lewes, DE 19958 USA",42,10.1371/journal.pone.0029535,2011

Settling corals, with limited energy to invest in competitive interactions, are particularly vulnerable during settlement into well-developed coral reef communities. This situation may be exacerbated for corals settling into coral-depauperate reefs where succession in nursery microhabitats moves rapidly toward heterotrophic organisms inhospitable to settling corals. To study effects of benthic organisms (at millimeter to centimeter scales) on newly settled corals and their survivorship we deployed terra-cotta coral settlement plates at 10 m depth on the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef in Belize and monitored them for 38 mo. During the second and third years, annual recruitment rates declined by over 50% from the previous year. Invertebrate crusts (primarily sponges) were absent at the start of the experiment but increased in abundance annually from 39, 60, to 73% of the plate undersides by year three. Subsequently, substrates hospitable to coral recruitment, including crustose coralline algae, biofilmed terra-cotta and polychaete tubes, declined. With succession, substrates upon which spat settled shifted toward organisms inimical to survivorship. Over 50% of spat mortality was due to overgrowth by sponges alone. This result suggests that when a disturbance creates primary substrate a ""recruitment window"" for settling corals exists from approximately 9 to 14 mo following the disturbance. During the window, early-succession, facilitating species are most abundant. The window closes as organisms hostile to coral settlement and survivorship overgrow nursery microhabitats.","[Arnold, Suzanne N.; Steneck, Robert S.] Univ Maine, Darling Marine Ctr, Walpole, ME 04573 USA",41,10.1371/journal.pone.0028681,2011

While perturbation studies, in the form of incubations under elevated pCO(2), reveal sensitivities and responses of individual species, one missing link in the OA story results from a chronic lack of pH data specific to a given species' natural habitat. Here, we present a compilation of continuous, high-resolution time series of upper ocean pH, collected using autonomous sensors, over a variety of ecosystems ranging from polar to tropical, open-ocean to coastal, kelp forest to coral reef. These observations reveal a continuum of month-long pH variability with standard deviations from 0.004 to 0.277 and ranges spanning 0.024 to 1.430 pH units. The nature of the observed variability was also highly site-dependent, with characteristic diel, semi-diurnal, and stochastic patterns of varying amplitudes. These biome-specific pH signatures disclose current levels of exposure to both high and low dissolved CO2, often demonstrating that resident organisms are already experiencing pH regimes that are not predicted until 2100. Our data provide a first step toward crystallizing the biophysical link between environmental history of pH exposure and physiological resilience of marine organisms to fluctuations in seawater CO2. Knowledge of this spatial and temporal variation in seawater chemistry allows us to improve the design of OA experiments: we can test organisms with a priori expectations of their tolerance guardrails, based on their natural range of exposure. Such hypothesis-testing will provide a deeper understanding of the effects of OA. Both intuitively simple to understand and powerfully informative, these and similar comparative time series can help guide management efforts to identify areas of marine habitat that can serve as refugia to acidification as well as areas that are particularly vulnerable to future ocean change.","[Hofmann, Gretchen E.; Matson, Paul G.; Rivest, Emily B.; Yu, Pauline C.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Smith, Jennifer E.; Send, Uwe; Levin, Lisa A.; Price, Nichole N.; Peterson, Brittany; Takeshita, Yuichiro; Frieder, Christina A.; Martz, Todd R.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Johnson, Kenneth S.] Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, Moss Landing, CA USA; [Micheli, Fiorenza; Kroeker, Kristy J.] Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Dept Biol, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA; [Paytan, Adina; Crook, Elizabeth Derse] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Gambi, Maria Cristina] Stn Zoolog Anton Dohrn, Lab Funct & Evolutionary Ecol, Naples, Italy",400,10.1371/journal.pone.0028983,2011

We examined spawning and larval ecology of Western Atlantic sphyraenids using monthly ichthyoplankton samples collected over 2 years along a transect spanning the east-west axis of the Straits of Florida (SOF). Samples were dominated by the great barracuda (92.8%) and sennets (Sphyraena borealis and Sphyraena picudilla; 6.6%). While larval sennets and S. barracuda displayed similar vertical distributions (majority in upper 25 m), horizontal and temporal patterns of abundance suggested a spatial and temporal species replacement between larval S. barracuda and sennets that tracks adult ecology. The diet of both taxa consisted largely of copepods, with inclusion of fish larvae at 8 mm SL, and in S. barracuda alone, a switch in the wet season to exclusive piscivory by 12 mm SL (18 days post-hatch). A lack of piscivory in S. barracuda larvae captured in the dry season corresponded to slower larval growth than in the wet season. Larval growth was also related to size-at-hatch and larval age such that larvae that were larger at hatch or larger (older) at capture grew faster at earlier ages, suggesting faster larval growth, and indirectly larger hatch size, conveys a survival advantage. Unlike larval growth, instantaneous mortality rate did not differ with season, and no lunar cyclic patterns in spawning output were identified. Our results provide insight into the pelagic phase of sphyraenids and highlight the importance of both diet and hatch size to the growth and survival of fish larvae in low latitude oceanic environments.","[D'Alessandro, E.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that sediment-enriched water impairs the ability of larval damselfish to find suitable settlement sites. At three different experimental concentrations of suspended sediment (45, 90, and 180 mg l(-1)), pre-settlement individuals of two species (Pomacentrus amboinensis and P. moluccensis) were not able to select their preferred habitat. In a clear water environment (no suspended sediment), both species exhibit a strong preference for live coral over partially dead and dead coral, choosing live coral 70 and 80% of the time, respectively. However, when exposed to suspended sediment, no habitat choice was observed, with individuals of both species settling on live coral, partially dead, and dead coral, at the same frequency. To determine a potential mechanism underlying these results, we tested chemosensory discrimination in sediment-enriched water. We demonstrated that sediment disrupts the ability of this species to respond to chemical cues from different substrata. That is, individuals of P. moluccensis prefer live coral to dead coral in clear water, but in sediment-enriched water, chemical cues from live and dead coral were not distinguished. These results suggest that increasing suspended sediment in coral reef environments may reduce settlement success or survival of coral reef fishes. A sediment-induced disruption of habitat choice may compound the effects of habitat loss on coral reefs.","[Wenger, Amelia S.; Johansen, J. L.; Jones, G.

Herein, we present a Middle Miocene (ca 14.5 Ma) shallow-marine carbonate record from the Styrian Basin (Austria) that shows recurrent breakdowns of the carbonate producers (i.e., coralline red algae and zooxanthellate corals) in response to ashfalls from nearby volcanic island sources. These volcanic events are preserved as distinct marl layers with idiomorphic biotite crystals and volcaniclasts that mantle the former seafloor topography. The pyroclastic sediments suffocated the carbonate producers in coral reef and seagrass environments. A subsequent turbid, eutrophic phase caused by the redistribution, suspension, and dissolution of volcaniclastics is characterized by the spreading of suspension-feeding biota, coralline algae, and the larger benthic foraminifer Planostegina. During this stage, rapidly consolidated pyroclastic deposits acted as hard grounds for attached-living bivalves. The fact that the facies below and above the studied ashbeds are almost identical suggests that volcaniclastic events had no long-lasting effects on the structure of the carbonate-producing benthic communities. Although Miocene shallow-water carbonate systems of the circum-Mediterranean region are well known and situated in one of the geodynamically most active regions worldwide, this study is the first that exams the impact of volcanic sedimentation events on shallow marine ecosystems.","[Reuter, M.; Piller, W.

Although reef fish larvae are known to display behavioral adaptations that influence settlement site selection, little is known about the development of behavioral preferences throughout the larval phase. Whether larvae are attracted to the same sensory cues throughout their larval phase, or exhibit distinct ontogenetic shifts in sensory preference is unknown. Here, we demonstrate an ontogenetic shift in olfactory cue preferences for two species of anemonefish, a process that could aid in understanding both patterns of dispersal and settlement. Aquarium-bred na < ve Amphiprion percula and A. melanopus larvae were tested for olfactory preference of relevant reef-associated chemical cues throughout the 11-day pelagic larval stage. Age posthatching had a significant effect on the preference for olfactory cues from host anemones and live corals for both species. Preferences of olfactory cues from tropical plants of A. percula, increased by approximately ninefold between hatching and settlement, with A. percula larvae showing a fivefold increase in preference for the olfactory cue produced by the grass species. Larval age had no effect on the olfactory preference for untreated seawater over the swamp-based tree Melaleuca nervosa, which was always avoided compared with blank seawater. These results indicate that reef fish larvae are capable of utilizing olfactory cues early in the larval stage and may be predisposed to disperse away from reefs, with innate olfactory preferences drawing newly hatched larvae into the pelagic environment. Toward the end of the larval phase, larvae become attracted to the olfactory cues of appropriate habitats, which may assist them in identification of and navigation toward suitable settlement sites.","[Dixson, D.

One such barrier was the Torres Strait land bridge between continental Australia and New Guinea that persisted through much of the late Pleistocene and separated Indian and Pacific Ocean taxa. Here, we examine the patterns of mitochondrial DNA diversity for marine animals with present-day distributions spanning the Torres Strait. Specifically, we investigate whether there are concordant signatures across species, consistent with either vicariance or recent colonization from either ocean basin. We survey four species of reef fishes (Apogon doederleini, Pomacentrus coelestis, Dascyllus trimaculatus, and Acanthurus triostegus) for mtDNA cytochrome oxidase 1 and control region variation and contrast these results to previous mtDNA studies in diverse marine animals with similar distributions. We find substantial genetic partitioning (estimated from F-statistics and coalescent approaches) between Indian and Pacific Ocean populations for many species, consistent with regional persistence through the late Pleistocene in both ocean basins. The species-specific estimates of genetic divergence, however, vary greatly and for reef fishes we estimate substantially different divergence times among species. It is likely that Indian and Pacific Ocean populations have been isolated for multiple glacial cycles for some species, whereas for other species genetic connections have been more recent. Regional estimates of genetic diversity and directionality of gene flow also vary among species. Thus, there is no apparent consistency among historical patterns across the Torres Strait for these co-distributed marine animals.","[Mirams, A. G. K.; Treml, E. A.; Shields, J.

Over the last two decades, it has expanded its vertical distribution to both shallow and deep reefs along the leeward coast of the island of Cura double dagger ao, Southern Caribbean. However, the ecological implications of this expansion and the role of L. variegata as a living substratum are poorly known. This study compared epiphytic algal communities on L. variegata blades along two depth transects (6-40 m). The epiphytic community was diverse with a total of 70 species of which 49 were found directly attached to L. variegata. The epiphytic community varied significantly between blade surface, depth and site. The greatest number of genera per blade was found growing on the underside of the blades regardless of site and depth. Filamentous red algae (e.g. Neosiphonia howei) were commonly found on the upperside of the blades over the whole depth gradient, whereas the underside was mainly colonized by calcifying (e.g. Hydrolithon spp., Jania spp., Amphiroa fragillissima), fleshy red algae (e.g. Champia spp., Gelidiopsis spp., Hypnea spinella) and foliose brown alga (e.g. Dictyota spp.). Anotrichum tenue, a red alga capable of overgrowing corals, was a common epiphyte of both blade surfaces. L. variegata plays an important role as a newly available substratum. Thus, its spread may influence other algal species and studies of benthic macroalgae such as L. variegata should also take into consideration their associated epiphytic algal communities.","[Fricke, A.; Nugues, M.

Conventional bulk otolith and muscle stable isotope analyses (SIA) and essential amino acid (AA) SIA were conducted on snapper collected from seagrass beds, mangroves, and coral reefs in the Red Sea, Caribbean Sea, and Pacific coast of Panama. While bulk stable isotope values in otoliths showed regional differences, they failed to distinguish nursery residence on local scales. Essential AA delta(13)C values in otoliths, on the other hand, varied as a function of habitat type and provided a better tracer of residence in different juvenile nursery habitats than conventional bulk otolith SIA alone. A strong linear relationship was found between paired otolith and muscle essential AA delta(13)C values regardless of species, geographic region, or habitat type, indicating that otolith AAs recorded the same dietary information as muscle AAs. Juvenile snapper in the Red Sea sheltered in mangroves but fed in seagrass beds, while snapper from the Caribbean Sea and Pacific coast of Panama showed greater reliance on mangrove-derived carbon. Furthermore, compound-specific SIA revealed that microbially recycled detrital carbon, not water-column-based new phytoplankton carbon, was the primary carbon source supporting snapper production on coastal reefs of the Red Sea. This study presented robust tracers of juvenile nursery residence that will be crucial for reconstructing ontogenetic migration patterns of fishes among coastal wetlands and coral reefs.

To examine these interactions, we studied dissolved organic matter release by dominant benthic taxa and subsequent microbial remineralization in the lagoonal reefs of Moorea, French Polynesia. Rates of photosynthesis, respiration, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release were assessed for several common benthic reef organisms from the backreef habitat. We assessed microbial community response to dissolved exudates of each benthic producer by measuring bacterioplankton growth, respiration, and DOC drawdown in two-day dark dilution culture incubations. Experiments were conducted for six benthic producers: three species of macroalgae (each representing a different algal phylum: Turbinaria ornata - Ochrophyta; Amansia rhodantha - Rhodophyta; Halimeda opuntia - Chlorophyta), a mixed assemblage of turf algae, a species of crustose coralline algae (Hydrolithon reinboldii) and a dominant hermatypic coral (Porites lobata). Our results show that all five types of algae, but not the coral, exuded significant amounts of labile DOC into their surrounding environment. In general, primary producers with the highest rates of photosynthesis released the most DOC and yielded the greatest bacterioplankton growth; turf algae produced nearly twice as much DOC per unit surface area than the other benthic producers (14.0 +/- 2.8 mu mol h(-1) dm(-2)), stimulating rapid bacterioplankton growth (0.044 +/- 0.002 log10 cells h(-1)) and concomitant oxygen drawdown (0.16 +/- 0.05 mu mol L(-1) h(-1) dm(-2)). Our results demonstrate that benthic reef algae can release a significant fraction of their photosynthetically-fixed carbon as DOC, these release rates vary by species, and this DOC is available to and consumed by reef associated microbes. These data provide compelling evidence that benthic primary producers differentially influence reef microbial dynamics and biogeochemical parameters (i.e., DOC and oxygen availability, bacterial abundance and metabolism) in coral reef communities.","[Haas, Andreas F.; Leichter, James J.; Wyatt, Alex; Smith, Jennifer E.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Nelson, Craig E.; Carlson, Craig A.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Kelly, Linda Wegley; Rohwer, Forest] San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Carlson, Craig A.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",83,10.1371/journal.pone.0027973,2011

In conjunction with the publically available World Registry of Marine Species database (WoRMS) and one of the world's premier electronic scientific literature databases (Web of Science (R)), a text mining approach is used to examine the distribution of existing ecological knowledge among taxa in coral reef, mangrove, seagrass and kelp bed ecosystems. We found that for each of these ecosystems, most research has been limited to a few groups of organisms. While this bias clearly reflects the perceived importance of some taxa as commercially or ecologically valuable, the relative lack of research of other taxonomic groups highlights the problem that some key taxa and associated ecosystem processes they affect may be poorly understood or completely ignored.

To date, most analyses have focussed on static patterns or changes in single variables such as coral cover. However, little is known about how community-level changes occur at large spatial scales. Here, we develop Markov models of annual changes in coral and macroalgal cover in the Caribbean and Great Barrier Reef (GBR) regions. We analyzed reef surveys from the Caribbean and GBR (1996-2006). We defined a set of reef states distinguished by coral and macroalgal cover, and obtained Bayesian estimates of the annual probabilities of transitions between these states. The Caribbean and GBR had different transition probabilities, and therefore different rates of change in reef condition. This could be due to differences in species composition, management or the nature and extent of disturbances between these regions. We then estimated equilibrium probability distributions for reef states, and coral and macroalgal cover under constant environmental conditions. In both regions, the current distributions are close to equilibrium. In the Caribbean, coral cover is much lower and macroalgal cover is higher at equilibrium than in the GBR. We found no evidence for differences in transition probabilities between the first and second halves of our survey period, or between Caribbean reefs inside and outside marine protected areas. However, our power to detect such differences may have been low. We also examined the effects of altering transition probabilities on the community state equilibrium, along a continuum from unfavourable (e.g., increased sea surface temperature) to favourable (e.g., improved management) conditions. Both regions showed similar qualitative responses, but different patterns of uncertainty. In the Caribbean, uncertainty was greatest about effects of favourable changes, while in the GBR, we are most uncertain about effects of unfavourable changes. Our approach could be extended to provide risk analysis for management decisions.","[Lowe, Phillip K.; Spencer, Matthew] Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Bruno, John F.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Selig, Elizabeth R.] Conservat Int, Sci & Knowledge Div, Arlington, VA USA",3,10.1371/journal.pone.0026339,2011

However, this relationship is poorly understood and undocumented for species-rich coastal marine ecosystems. Here, we used underwater visual censuses to examine the patterns of functional redundancy for one of the most diverse vertebrate assemblages, the coral reef fishes of New Caledonia, South Pacific. First, we found that the relationship between functional and species diversity displayed a non-asymptotic power-shaped curve, implying that rare functions and species mainly occur in highly diverse assemblages. Second, we showed that the distribution of species amongst possible functions was significantly different from a random distribution up to a threshold of similar to 90 species/transect. Redundancy patterns for each function further revealed that some functions displayed fast rates of increase in redundancy at low species diversity, whereas others were only becoming redundant past a certain threshold. This suggested non-random assembly rules and the existence of some primordial functions that would need to be fulfilled in priority so that coral reef fish assemblages can gain a basic ecological structure. Last, we found little effect of habitat on the shape of the functional-species diversity relationship and on the redundancy of functions, although habitat is known to largely determine assemblage characteristics such as species composition, biomass, and abundance. Our study shows that low functional redundancy is characteristic of this highly diverse fish assemblage, and, therefore, that even species-rich ecosystems such as coral reefs may be vulnerable to the removal of a few keystone species.","[Guillemot, Nicolas; Vigliola, Laurent] IRD, UR CoReUs, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Guillemot, Nicolas] Univ Europeenne Bretagne, INRA Ecol & Sante Ecosyst, UMR 985, Rennes, France; [Guillemot, Nicolas] Koniambo Nickel SAS, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Kulbicki, Michel] IRD, UR CoReUs, Banyuls Sur Mer, France; [Chabanet, Pascale] IRD, UR CoReUs, Ste Clotilde, Reunion, France",50,10.1371/journal.pone.0026735,2011

Because traditional methods for assessing reef diversity are extremely time consuming, taxonomic expertise for many groups is lacking, and marine organisms are thought to be less vulnerable to extinction, most discussions of reef conservation focus on maintenance of ecosystem services rather than biodiversity loss. In this study involving the three major oceans with reef growth, we provide new biodiversity estimates based on quantitative sampling and DNA barcoding. We focus on crustaceans, which are the second most diverse group of marine metazoans. We show exceptionally high numbers of crustacean species associated with coral reefs relative to sampling effort (525 species from a combined, globally distributed sample area of 6.3 m(2)). The high prevalence of rare species (38% encountered only once), the low level of spatial overlap (81% found in only one locality) and the biogeographic patterns of diversity detected (Indo-West Pacific > Central Pacific > Caribbean) are consistent with results from traditional survey methods, making this approach a reliable and efficient method for assessing and monitoring biodiversity.

These eight ecological metrics each exhibited specific thresholds along a continuum of fishable biomass ranging from heavily fished sites to old fisheries closures. Three thresholds lay above and five below a hypothesized window of fishable biomass expected to produce a maximum multispecies sustainable yield (B-MMSY). Evaluating three management systems in nine countries, we found that unregulated fisheries often operate belowthe B-MMSY, whereas fisheries closures and, less frequently, gear-restricted fisheries were within or above this window.

In addition, we used an assignment/exclusion test to identify immigrants arriving from genetically distinct sources. Overall, 82 per cent of the juveniles were immigrants while 18 per cent were progeny of parents genotyped in our focal metapopulation. Of the immigrants, only 6 per cent were likely to be genetically distinct from the focal metapopulation, suggesting most of the connectivity is among sub-populations from a rather homogeneous genetic pool. Of the 18 per cent that were progeny of known adults, two-thirds dispersed among the eight sub-populations and only one-third settled back into natal sub-populations.

Our results challenge conventional assumptions and reported findings that human impacts to ecosystems are cumulative and lead only to long-term trajectories of environmental decline.

The ability of reefs to reassemble and regenerate after disturbances (i.e., resilience) is largely dependent on the capacity of herbivores to prevent macroalgal expansion, and the replenishment of coral populations through larval recruitment. Currently there is a paucity of this information for higher latitude, subtropical reefs. To assess the potential resilience of the benthic reef assemblages of Lord Howe Island (31 degrees 32'S, 159 degrees 04'E), the worlds' southernmost coral reef, we quantified the benthic composition, densities of juvenile corals (as a proxy for coral recruitment), and herbivorous fish communities. Despite some variation among habitats and sites, benthic communities were dominated by live scleractinian corals (mean cover 37.4%) and fleshy macroalgae (20.9%). Live coral cover was higher than in most other subtropical reefs and directly comparable to lower latitude tropical reefs. Juvenile coral densities (0.8 ind.m(-2)), however, were 5-200 times lower than those reported for tropical reefs. Overall, macroalgal cover was negatively related to the cover of live coral and the density of juvenile corals, but displayed no relationship with herbivorous fish biomass. The biomass of herbivorous fishes was relatively low (204 kg.ha(-1)), and in marked contrast to tropical reefs was dominated by macroalgal browsing species (84.1%) with relatively few grazing species. Despite their extremely low biomass, grazing fishes were positively related to both the density of juvenile corals and the cover of bare substrata, suggesting that they may enhance the recruitment of corals through the provision of suitable settlement sites. Although Lord Howe Islands' reefs are currently coral-dominated, the high macroalgal cover, coupled with limited coral recruitment and low coral growth rates suggest these reefs may be extremely susceptible to future disturbances.","[Hoey, Andrew S.] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; [Hoey, Andrew S.; Pratchett, Morgan S.; Cvitanovic, Christopher] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia",56,10.1371/journal.pone.0025824,2011

We did the first evolutionary analyses of morphology and motion kinematics of the feeding apparatus in Indo-Pacific members of an iconic family of biters, the marine angelfishes (f. Pomacanthidae). We found clear interspecific differences in gut morphology that clearly reflected a wide range of trophic niches. In contrast, feeding apparatus morphology appeared to be conserved. A few unusual structural innovations enabled angelfishes to protrude their jaws, close them in the protruded state, and tear food items from the substratum at a high velocity. Only one clade, the speciose pygmy angelfishes, showed functional departure from the generalized and clade-defining grab-and-tearing feeding pattern. By comparing the feeding kinematics of angelfishes with wrasses and parrotfishes (f. Labridae) we showed that grab-and-tearing is based on low kinematics disparity. Regardless of its restricted disparity, the grab-and-tearing feeding apparatus has enabled angelfishes to negotiate ecological thresholds: Given their widely different body sizes, angelfishes can access many structurally complex benthic surfaces that other biters likely are unable to exploit. From these surfaces, angelfishes can dislodge sturdy food items from their tough attachments. Angelfishes thus provide an intriguing example of a successful group that appears to have evolved considerable trophic diversity based on an unusual yet conserved feeding apparatus configuration that is characterized by limited functional disparity.","James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld, Australia; James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia",17,10.1371/journal.pone.0024113,2011

Determining larval dispersal commonly involves the use of computationally demanding and expensively calibrated/validated hydrodynamic models that resolve reef wake eddies. This study models variation in larval retention times for a range of reef shapes and circulation regimes, using a reef-scale three-dimensional hydrodynamic model. It also explores how well larval retention time can be estimated based on the ""Island Wake Parameter"", a measure of the degree of flow turbulence in the wake of reefs that is a simple function of flow speed, reef dimension, and vertical diffusion. The mean residence times found in the present study (0.48-5.64 days) indicate substantial potential for self-recruitment of species whose larvae are passive, or weak swimmers, for the first several days after release. Results also reveal strong and significant relationships between the Island Wake Parameter and mean residence time, explaining 81-92% of the variability in retention among reefs across a range of unidirectional flow speeds and tidal regimes. These findings suggest that good estimates of larval retention may be obtained from relatively coarse-scale characteristics of the flow, and basic features of reef geomorphology. Such approximations may be a valuable tool for modeling connectivity and meta-population dynamics over large spatial scales, where explicitly characterizing fine-scale flows around reef requires a prohibitive amount of computation and extensive model calibration.","[Cetina-Heredia, Paulina; Connolly, Sean R.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Cetina-Heredia, Paulina] James Cook Univ, Sch Engn & Phys Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Connolly, Sean R.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",7,10.1007/s00338-011-0749-z,2011

From July 2002, a thermal stress event occurred, which peaked at 21 Degree Heating Weeks (DHW) in January 2003 and persisted for 4 years. Such thermal stress was greater than any thermal event reported in the coral reef literature. Reef surveys were conducted in July 2000, June 2002, and May 2005, for six of the eight islands. Sampling was stratified by exposure (windward, leeward, and lagoon) and depth (5, 10, 15, and 25 m). The thermal stress event caused mass coral mortality, and coral cover declined by approximately 60% between 2002 and 2005. However, mortality varied among sites (12-100%) and among islands (42-79%) and varied in accordance with the presence of a lagoon, island size, and windward vs. leeward exposure. Leeward reefs experienced the highest and most consistent decline in coral cover. Island size and the presence of a lagoon showed positive correlations with coral mortality, most likely because of the longer water residence time enhancing heating. Windward reefs showed cooler conditions than leeward reefs. Recently dead corals were observed at depths > 35 m on windward and > 45 m on leeward reefs. Between-island variation in temperature had no effect on between-island variation in coral mortality. Mortality levels reported here were comparable to those reported for the most extreme thermal stress events of 9-10 DHW in other regions. These results highlight the high degree of acclimation and/or adaptation of the corals in the Phoenix Islands to their local temperature regime, and their consequent vulnerability to anomalous events.

This study examines the consequences of chronic predation by juvenile coral-feeding butterflyfishes on their specific host corals. Juvenile butterflyfishes had high levels of site fidelity for host corals with 88% (38/43) of small (< 30 mm) juveniles of Chaetodon plebeius feeding exclusively from a single host colony. This highly concentrated predation had negative effects on the condition of these colonies, with tissue biomass declining with increasing predation intensity. Declines were consistent across both field observations and a controlled experiment. Coral tissue biomass declined by 26.7, 44.5 and 53.4% in low, medium and high predation intensity treatments. Similarly, a 41.7% difference in coral tissue biomass was observed between colonies that were naturally inhabited by juvenile butterflyfish compared to uninhabited control colonies. Total lipid content of host corals declined by 29-38% across all treatments including controls and was not related to predation intensity; rather, this decline coincided with the mass spawning of corals and the loss of lipid-rich eggs. Although the speed at which lost coral tissue is regenerated and the long-term consequences for growth and reproduction remain unknown, our findings indicate that predation by juvenile butterflyfishes represents a chronic stress to these coral colonies and will have negative energetic consequences for the corals used as settlement habitat.","[Cole, A.

While a build-up of fish biomass has occurred inside reserve boundaries, it is unknown whether reserve size matches the scale of movement of target species. Using passive acoustic telemetry, we quantified movement patterns and home range size of two heavily exploited unicornfish Naso unicornis and Naso lituratus. Fifteen fish (N. unicornis: n = 7; N. lituratus: n = 4 male, n = 4 female) were fitted with internal acoustic tags and tracked continuously over four months within a remote acoustic receiver array located in a decade-old marine reserve. This approach provided robust estimates of unicornfish movement patterns and home range size. The mean home range of 3.2 ha for N. unicornis was almost ten times larger than that previously recorded from a three-week tracking study of the species in Hawaii. While N. lituratus were smaller in body size, their mean home range (6.8 ha) was over twice that of N. unicornis. Both species displayed strong site fidelity, particularly during nocturnal and crepuscular periods. Although there was some overlap, individual movement patterns and home range size were highly variable within species and between sexes. N. unicornis home range increased with body size, and only the three largest fish home ranges extended into the deeper outer reef slope beyond the shallow reef flat. Both Naso species favoured habitat dominated by corals. Some individuals made predictable daily crepuscular migrations between different locations or habitat types. There was no evidence of significant spillover from the marine reserve into adjacent fished areas. Strong site fidelity coupled with negligible spillover suggests that small-scale reserves, with natural habitat boundaries to emigration, are effective in protecting localized unicornfish populations.","[Marshell, A.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Marshell, A.; Mills, J.

Here we employ a combination of surveys and a non-invasive tethering technique to examine these patterns in an intact coral reef system on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). We also assess local scale variation in relative diurnal predation pressure. Surveys revealed that sea urchins were active and exposed at night. Echinometra mathaei and Echinothrix calamaris were the most abundant species with significantly higher night densities (0.21 and 0.03 ind. m(-2), respectively), than daytime densities (0.05 and 0.001, respectively). Bioassays revealed that exposed adult E. mathaei (the most abundant sea urchin species) were 30.8 times more likely to be eaten during the day than at night when controlling for sites. This observation concurs with widely held assumptions that nocturnal activity is a risk-related adaptive response to diurnal predation pressure. Despite relatively intact predator communities on the GBR, potential predation pressure on diurnally exposed E. mathaei assays was variable at a local scale and the biomass of potential fish predators at each site was a poor predictive measure of this variation. Patterns in predation appear to be more complex and variable than we may have assumed.","[Young, M. A. L.; Bellwood, D.

The one major coral reef region where such assessments have not been made is the Indian Ocean (IO). Here, we compiled coral cover survey data from across the IO into a database of similar to 2,000 surveys from 366 coral reef sites collected between 1977 and 2005. The compilation shows that the 1998 mass coral bleaching event was the single most important and widespread factor influencing the change in coral cover across the region. The trend in coral cover followed a step-type function driven by the 1998 period, which differs from findings in the Caribbean and the PSEA regions where declines have been more continuous and mostly began in the 1980s. Significant regional variation was observed, with most heterogeneity occurring during and after 1998. There was a significant relationship between cover and longitude for all periods, but the relationship became stronger in the period immediately after 1998. Before 1998, highest coral cover was observed in the central IO region, while this changed to the eastern region after 1998. Coral cover and latitude displayed a significant U-shaped relationship immediately after 1998, due to a large decrease in cover in the northern-central regions. Post-1998 coral cover was directly correlated to the impact of the disturbance; areas with the lowest mortality having the highest cover with India-Sri Lanka being an outlier due to its exceptionally high recovery. In 1998, reefs within Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) were more heavily impacted than unmanaged reefs, losing significantly greater total cover. MPA recovery was greater such that no differences were observed by 2001-2005. This study indicates that the regional patterns in coral cover distribution in the IO are driven mainly by episodic and acute environmental stress.","[Ateweberhan, M.; Sheppard, C. R.

While factors underlying the distribution patterns of these specialists have been studied for decades, few papers have considered factors influencing both the microhabitat and the inhabitant. On the Belizean barrier reef, the obligate sponge-dwelling goby Elacatinus lori inhabits the yellow tube sponge Aplysina fistularis. We used field data and multivariate analyses to simultaneously consider factors influencing sponge and goby distributions. Sponges were non-randomly distributed across the reef with density peaking at a depth of 10-20 m. Sponge morphology also varied with depth: sponges tended to be larger and have fewer tubes with increasing depth. Knowing these patterns of sponge distribution and morphology, we considered how they influenced the distribution of two categories of gobies: residents (a parts per thousand yen18 mm SL) and settlers (< 18 mm SL). Maximum tube length, number of sponge tubes, and depth were significant predictors of resident distribution. Residents were most abundant in large sponges with multiple tubes, and were virtually absent from sponges shallower than 10 m. Similarly, maximum tube length and number of sponge tubes were significant predictors of settler distribution, with settlers most abundant in large sponges with multiple tubes. The presence or absence of residents in a sponge was not a significant predictor of settler distribution. These results provide us with a clear understanding of where sponges and gobies are found on the reef and support the hypothesis that microhabitat characteristics are good predictors of fish abundance for species that are tightly linked to microhabitat.","[D'Aloia, C.

At the end of the larval phase, most coral reef fishes enter patches of reef containing novel predators. Since vision is often obscured in the complex surroundings, chemical information released from damaged conspecific is used to forewarn prey of an active predator. However, larvae enter the reef environment with their own feeding and growth histories, which will influence their motivation to feed and take risks. The present study explored the link between recent growth, feeding history, current performance and behavioural risk taking in newly settling stages of a coral reef damselfish (Pomacentrus amboinensis). Older and larger juveniles in good body condition had a stronger response to chemical alarm cues of injured conspecifics; these fish spent a longer time in shelter and displayed a more dramatic decrease in foraging behaviour than fish in lower body condition. Feeding experiments supported these findings and emphasized the importance of body condition in affecting risk assessment. Evidently, larval growth history and body condition influences the likelihood of taking risks under the threat of predation immediately after settlement, thereby affecting the probability of survival in P. amboinensis.","[Loennstedt, O.

Predators may in turn play an important role in structuring prey populations and communities. Responses of predators to variation in prey abundance have most commonly been demonstrated in low-diversity communities where food webs are relatively simple. How predators respond in highly diverse assemblages such as in coral reef habitats is largely unknown. This study describes an experiment that examined how the movement, diet and growth of the coral reef piscivore, Cephalopholis boenak (Serranidae) responded to variation in the abundance of its prey. Predator densities were standardised on small patch reefs made from the lagoonal reef-building coral, Porites cylindrica. These patch reefs exhibited natural variation in the abundance and community structure of multiple species of prey. However, our experiment generated a relatively simple predator-prey relationship, with C. boenak primarily responding to the most abundant species of prey. Three responses of predators were observed: aggregative, functional and developmental. Thirty-one per cent of individuals moved between patch reefs during the experiment, all from areas of relatively low to high prey density. Feeding rates were higher on patch reefs of high prey density, while growth rates of fish that remained on low prey density reefs throughout the experiment were lower. Growth rates of C. boenak on the experimental reefs were also much higher than for those living on natural patch reefs over the same time period, corresponding with overall differences in prey abundance. These results suggest that local abundance, feeding rate and growth of C. boenak were closely linked to the abundance of their main prey. This combination of predatory responses is a potential mechanism behind recent observations of density-dependent mortality and population regulation of prey in coral reef fish communities.","[Beukers-Stewart, B.

Therefore, there is a growing need to understand the processes that affect the capacity of these ecosystems to return to coral dominance following disturbances, including those that prevent the establishment of persistent stands of macroalgae. Unlike many reefs in the Caribbean, over the last several decades, reefs around the Indo-Pacific island of Moorea, French Polynesia have consistently returned to coral dominance following major perturbations without shifting to a macroalgae-dominated state. Here, we present evidence of a rapid increase in populations of herbivorous fishes following the most recent perturbation, and show that grazing by these herbivores has prevented the establishment of macroalgae following near complete loss of coral on offshore reefs. Importantly, we found the positive response of herbivorous fishes to increased benthic primary productivity associated with coral loss was driven largely by parrotfishes that initially recruit to stable nursery habitat within the lagoons before moving to offshore reefs later in life. These results underscore the importance of connectivity between the lagoon and offshore reefs for preventing the establishment of macroalgae following disturbances, and indicate that protecting nearshore nursery habitat of herbivorous fishes is critical for maintaining reef resilience.","[Adam, Thomas C.; Schmitt, Russell J.; Holbrook, Sally J.; Brooks, Andrew J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Coastal Res Ctr, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Schmitt, Russell J.; Holbrook, Sally J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Edmunds, Peter J.; Carpenter, Robert C.] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; [Bernardi, Giacomo] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",124,10.1371/journal.pone.0023717,2011

Recent studies have shown that ecological variation also occurs along the coastline at a variety of spatial scales. Little is known, however, on how vertical variation compares with horizontal variation measured at increasing spatial scales (in terms of sampling interval). Because broad-scale processes can generate geographical patterns in community structure, we tested the hypothesis that vertical ecological variation is higher than fine-scale horizontal variation but lower than broad-scale horizontal variation. To test this prediction, we compared the variation in community structure across intertidal elevations on rocky shores of Helgoland Island with independent estimates of horizontal variation measured at the scale of patches (quadrats separated by 10s of cm), sites (quadrats separated by a few m), and shores (quadrats separated by 100s to 1000s of m). The multivariate analyses done on community structure supported our prediction. Specifically, vertical variation was significantly higher than patch-and site-scale horizontal variation but lower than shore-scale horizontal variation. Similar patterns were found for the variation in abundance of foundation taxa such as Fucus spp. and Mastocarpus stellatus, suggesting that the effects of these canopy-forming algae, known to function as ecosystem engineers, may explain part of the observed variability in community structure. Our findings suggest that broad-scale processes affecting species performance increase ecological variability relative to the pervasive fine-scale patchiness already described for marine coasts and the well known variation caused by vertical stress gradients. Our results also indicate that experimental research aiming to understand community structure on marine shores should benefit from applying a multi-scale approach.","[Valdivia, Nelson] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ciencias Marinas & Limnol, Valdivia, Chile; [Valdivia, Nelson] Univ Catolica Norte, Fac Ciencias Mar, CEAZA, Coquimbo, Chile; [Scrosati, Ricardo A.; Knox, Amanda S.] St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Biol, Antigonish, NS B2G 1C0, Canada; [Molis, Markus] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Sect Funct Ecol, Biol Anstalt Helgoland, Helgoland, Germany",19,10.1371/journal.pone.0024062,2011

In order to examine humans as a source and other marine invertebrates as vectors and/or reservoirs of the APS pathogen, challenge experiments were conducted with A. palmata maintained in closed aquaria to determine infectivity of strain PDR60 from reef and wastewater sources. Strain PDR60 from wastewater and diseased A. palmata caused disease signs in elkhorn coral in as little as four and five days, respectively, demonstrating that wastewater is a definitive source of APS and identifying human strain PDR60 as a coral pathogen through fulfillment of Koch's postulates. A. palmata inoculated with strain PDR60 from C. abbreviata showed limited virulence, with one of three inoculated fragments developing APS signs within 13 days. Strain PDR60 from non-host coral S. siderea showed a delayed pathogenic effect, with disease signs developing within an average of 20 days. These results suggest that C. abbreviata and non-host corals may function as reservoirs or vectors of the APS pathogen.

Although chlorarachniophytes are a small group (the phylum of Chlorarachniophyta contains 14 species in 8 genera), they have variable and complex life cycles that include amoeboid, coccoid, and/or flagellate cells. The majority of chlorarachniophytes possess two or more cell types in their life cycles, and which cell types are found is one of the principle morphological criteria used for species descriptions. Here we describe an unidentified chlorarachniophyte that was isolated from an artificial coral reef that calls this criterion into question. The life cycle of the new strain includes all three major cell types, but DNA barcoding based on the established nucleomorph ITS sequences showed it to share 100% sequence identity with Lotharella globosa. The type strain of L. globosa was also isolated from a coral reef, but is defined as completely lacking an amoeboid stage throughout its life cycle. We conclude that L. globosa possesses morphological diversity between culture strains, and that the new strain is a variety of L. globosa, which we describe as Lotharella globosa var. fortis var. nov. to include the amoeboid stage in the formal description of L. globosa. This intraspecies variation suggest that gross morphological stages maybe lost rather rapidly, and specifically that the type strain of L. globosa has lost the ability to form the amoeboid stage, perhaps recently. This in turn suggests that even major morphological characters used for taxonomy of this group may be variable in natural populations, and therefore misleading.","[Hirakawa, Yoshihisa] Univ British Columbia, Canadian Inst Adv Res, Vancouver, BC, Canada; Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, Vancouver, BC, Canada",4,10.1371/journal.pone.0023193,2011

Cabo Pulmo National Park (CPNP) was created in 1995 and is the only well enforced no-take area in the Gulf of California, Mexico, mostly because of widespread support from the local community. In 1999, four years after the establishment of the reserve, there were no significant differences in fish biomass between CPNP (0.75 t ha(-1) on average) and other marine protected areas or open access areas in the Gulf of California. By 2009, total fish biomass at CPNP had increased to 4.24 t ha(-1) (absolute biomass increase of 3.49 t ha(-1), or 463%), and the biomass of top predators and carnivores increased by 11 and 4 times, respectively. However, fish biomass did not change significantly in other marine protected areas or open access areas over the same time period. The absolute increase in fish biomass at CPNP within a decade is the largest measured in a marine reserve worldwide, and it is likely due to a combination of social (strong community leadership, social cohesion, effective enforcement) and ecological factors. The recovery of fish biomass inside CPNP has resulted in significant economic benefits, indicating that community-managed marine reserves are a viable solution to unsustainable coastal development and fisheries collapse in the Gulf of California and elsewhere.","[Aburto-Oropeza, Octavio; Erisman, Brad; Galland, Grantly R.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Div Marine Biol Res, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Mascarenas-Osorio, Ismael] Ctr Biodiversidad Marina & Conservac, La Paz, Bcs, Mexico; [Sala, Enric] Natl Geog Soc, Washington, DC USA; [Sala, Enric] Ctr Estudis Avancats Blanes CSIC, Blanes, Spain; [Ezcurra, Exequiel] Univ Calif Riverside, UC MEXUS, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",77,10.1371/journal.pone.0023601,2011

Fishing pressure was positively associated with higher FID, but only in families that were primarily targeted by spear guns. Among these families, there were variable responses in FID; some families showed increased FID monotonically with fishing pressure, while others showed increased FID only at the highest levels of fishing pressure.

This study describes sexual phenotype differences in abundances of zic2 mRNA in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus, a region strongly implicated in sexual behavior and function, in an adult teleost, Thalassoma bifasciatum. The bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum) is a valuable model for studying neuroendocrine processes because it displays two discrete male phenotypes, initial phase (IP) males and territorial, terminal phase (TP) males, and undergoes socially-controlled protogynous sex change. Previously generated microarray-based comparisons suggested that zic2 was upregulated in the brains of terminal phase males relative to initial phase males. To further explore this difference, we cloned a 727 bp sequence for neural zic2 from field-collected animals. Riboprobe-based in situ hybridization was employed to localize zic2 signal in adult bluehead brains and assess the relative abundance of brain zic2 mRNA across sexual phenotypes. We found zic2 mRNA expression was extremely abundant in the granular cells of the cerebellum and widespread in other brain regions including in the thalamus, hypothalamus, habenula, torus semicircularis, torus longitudinalis, medial longitudinal fascicle and telencephalic areas. Quantitative autoradiography and phosphorimaging showed zic2 mRNA hybridization signal in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus was significantly higher in terminal phase males relative to both initial phase males and females, and silver grain analysis confirmed this relationship between phenotypes.

However, it is currently unclear how elevated CO2 will impact the other key part of the predator-prey interaction - the predators. We investigated the effects of elevated CO2 and reduced pH on olfactory preferences, activity levels and feeding behaviour of a common coral reef meso-predator, the brown dottyback (Pseudochromis fuscus). Predators were exposed to either current-day CO2 levels or one of two elevated CO2 levels (similar to 600 mu atm or similar to 950 mu atm) that may occur by 2100 according to climate change predictions. Exposure to elevated CO2 and reduced pH caused a shift from preference to avoidance of the smell of injured prey, with CO2 treated predators spending approximately 20% less time in a water stream containing prey odour compared with controls. Furthermore, activity levels of fish was higher in the high CO2 treatment and feeding activity was lower for fish in the mid CO2 treatment; indicating that future conditions may potentially reduce the ability of the fish to respond rapidly to fluctuations in food availability. Elevated activity levels of predators in the high CO2 treatment, however, may compensate for reduced olfactory ability, as greater movement facilitated visual detection of food. Our findings show that, at least for the species tested to date, both parties in the predator-prey relationship may be affected by ocean acidification. Although impairment of olfactory-mediated behaviour of predators might reduce the risk of predation for larval fishes, the magnitude of the observed effects of elevated CO2 acidification appear to be more dramatic for prey compared to predators. Thus, it is unlikely that the altered behaviour of predators is sufficient to fully compensate for the effects of ocean acidification on prey mortality.","[Cripps, Ingrid L.; Munday, Philip L.; McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Munday, Philip L.; McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",102,10.1371/journal.pone.0022736,2011

Symbiotic shrimps are often considered to be commensals; however, in most cases, the relationship with sponge hosts remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that sponge-inhabiting shrimps are often parasites adapted to consumption of sponge tissues. First, we provide detailed examination of morphology and stomach contents of Typton carneus (Decapoda: Palaemonidae: Pontoniinae), a West Atlantic tropical shrimp living in fire sponges of the genus Tedania. Remarkable shear-like claws of T. carneus show evidence of intensive shearing, likely the result of crushing siliceous sponge spicules. Examination of stomach contents revealed that the host sponge tissue is a major source of food for T. carneus. A parasitic mode of life is also reflected in adaptations of mouth appendages, in the reproduction strategy, and in apparent sequestration of host pigments by shrimp. Consistent results were obtained also for congeneric species T. distinctus (Western Atlantic) and T. spongicola (Mediterranean). The distribution of shrimps among sponge hosts (mostly solitary individuals or heterosexual pairs) suggests that Typton shrimps actively prevent colonisation of their sponge by additional conspecifics, thus protecting their resource and reducing the damage to the hosts. We also demonstrate feeding on host tissues by sponge-associated shrimps of the genera Onycocaris, Periclimenaeus, and Thaumastocaris (Pontoniinae) and Synalpheus (Alpheidae). The parasitic mode of life appears to be widely distributed among sponge-inhabiting shrimps. However, it is possible that under some circumstances, the shrimps provide a service to the host sponge by preventing a penetration by potentially more damaging associated animals. The overall nature of interspecific shrimp-sponge relationships thus warrants further investigation.","[Duris, Zdenek; Horka, Ivona] Univ Ostrava, Fac Sci, Dept Biol & Ecol, Ostrava, Czech Republic; [Horka, Ivona; Juracka, Petr Jan; Petrusek, Adam] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Ecol, Prague, Czech Republic",21,10.1371/journal.pone.0021987,2011

Spawning at these capes is thought to result in rapid offshore transport of eggs, thereby reducing predation levels and facilitating dispersal to areas of suitable habitat. Methodology/Principal Findings: To test this ""off-reef transport"" hypothesis, we use a hydrodynamic model and explore the effects of topography on currents at submerged capes where spawning occurs and at similar capes where spawning does not occur, along the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef. All capes modeled in this study produced eddy-shedding regimes, but specific eddy attributes differed between spawning and non-spawning sites. Eddies at spawning sites were significantly stronger than those at non-spawning sites, and upwelling and fronts were the products of the eddy formation process. Frontal zones, present particularly at the edges of eddies near the shelf, may serve to retain larvae and nutrients. Spawning site eddies were also more predictable in terms of diameter and longevity. Passive particles released at spawning and control sites were dispersed from the release site at similar rates, but particles from spawning sites were more highly aggregated in their distributions than those from control sites, and remained closer to shore at all times. Conclusions/Significance: Our findings contradict previous hypotheses that cape spawning leads to high egg dispersion due to offshore transport, and that they are attractive for spawning due to high, variable currents. Rather, we show that current regimes at spawning sites are more predictable, concentrate the eggs, and keep larvae closer to shore. These attributes would confer evolutionary advantages by maintaining relatively similar recruitment patterns year after year.","[Karnauskas, Mandy] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Biol & Fisheries, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Cherubin, Laurent M.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Meteorol & Phys Oceanog, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Paris, Claire B.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Appl Marine Phys, Miami, FL 33149 USA",23,10.1371/journal.pone.0022067,2011

The present study examined the parrotfish Leptoscarus vaigiensis in seagrass meadows of a tropical embayment in the western Indian Ocean. Stomach content analysis and direct field observations showed that L. vaigiensis is an efficient grazer, feeding almost exclusively on seagrass leaves. Seagrass shoot density was highly correlated to all density variables (total, juvenile and subadult) and juvenile biomass of L. vaigiensis, while subadult biomass was predicted by distance to neighbouring coral habitat. Moreover, density and biomass of predatory fish (piscivores) were predicted by seagrass canopy height and the distribution patterns of predators followed those of L. vaigiensis. Hence, factors at local (seagrass structural complexity and feeding mode) and landscape scale levels (seascape context and distribution of piscivores) likely mutually structure herbivorous fish communities. The findings underscore the importance of incorporating multiple scale-dependent factors when managing coastal seagrass ecosystems and their associated key species.","[Gullstrom, Martin; Berkstrom, Charlotte] Stockholm Univ, Dept Syst Ecol, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Gullstrom, Martin; Ohman, Marcus C.; Dahlberg, Mattis] Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Gullstrom, Martin] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Marine Ecol Kristineberg, SE-45178 Fiskebackskil, Sweden; [Bodin, Maria] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Marine Ecol Tjarno, SE-45296 Stromstad, Sweden",23,10.1007/s00227-011-1665-z,2011

Adult lobsters were captured, tagged, and classified as either uninjured (n = 68), minimally injured (n = 39) or moderately injured (n = 19) depending on the number and type of appendages that were autotomized during capture and handling. Six to thirty-six months after release, 86 lobsters were recaptured (mean time at large = 305 days). Recapture rates of uninjured (64.7%), minimally injured (71.8%), and moderately injured lobsters (73.7%) were not significantly different. Similarly, mean annualized growth rates of uninjured, minimally injured, and moderately injured lobsters were not significantly different. This suggests that the energetic cost of a single episode of autotomy is either negligible or exists as a trade-off with some other life history trait, such as reduced reproductive performance. These results support the use of certain management tools (e.g., size limits) that prescribe release of non-legal lobsters, regardless of their injury status.","[Frisch, Ashley J.; Hobbs, Jean-Paul A.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",13,10.1007/s00227-011-1678-7,2011

Furthermore, mechanisms that may shift fish community structure in the presence of cleaning organisms are unclear. Here we show that on patch reefs (61-285 m(2)) which had all cleaner wrasse Labroides dimidiatus (Labridae) experimentally removed (1-5 adults reef(-1)) and which were then maintained cleaner-fish free over 8.5 years, individuals of two site-attached (resident) client damselfishes (Pomacentridae) were smaller compared to those on control reefs. Furthermore, resident fishes were 37% less abundant and 23% less species rich per reef, compared to control reefs. Such changes in site-attached fish may reflect lower fish growth rates and/or survivorship. Additionally, juveniles of visitors (fish likely to move between reefs) were 65% less abundant on removal reefs suggesting cleaners may also affect recruitment. This may, in part, explain the 23% lower abundance and 33% lower species richness of visitor fishes, and 66% lower abundance of visitor herbivores (Acanthuridae) on removal reefs that we also observed. This is the first study to demonstrate a benefit of cleaning behaviour to client individuals, in the form of increased size, and to elucidate potential mechanisms leading to community-wide effects on the fish population. Many of the fish groups affected may also indirectly affect other reef organisms, thus further impacting the reef community. The large-scale effect of the presence of the relatively small and uncommon fish, Labroides dimidiadus, on other fishes is unparalleled on coral reefs.","[Waldie, Peter A.; Blomberg, Simon P.; Cheney, Karen L.; Goldizen, Anne W.; Grutter, Alexandra S.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia",41,10.1371/journal.pone.0021201,2011

Controls of lionfish densities within its native range are poorly understood, but they have been recorded in the stomachs of large-bodied Caribbean groupers. Whether grouper predation of lionfish is sufficient to act as a biocontrol of the invasive species is unknown, but pest biocontrol by predatory fishes has been reported in other ecosystems. Groupers were surveyed along a chain of Bahamian reefs, including one of the region's most successful marine reserves which supports the top one percentile of Caribbean grouper biomass. Lionfish biomass exhibited a 7-fold and non-linear reduction in relation to the biomass of grouper. While Caribbean grouper appear to be a biocontrol of invasive lionfish, the overexploitation of their populations by fishers, means that their median biomass on Caribbean reefs is an order of magnitude less than in our study.

An abundance of weakly interacting species increases stability in natural systems, suggesting that loss of weakly linked species may reduce stability. Any link between the functional uniqueness of a species and the strength of its interactions in a food web could therefore have simultaneous effects on ecosystem functioning and stability. Here, we analyse patterns in 213 real food webs and show that highly unique species consistently tend to have the weakest mean interaction strength per unit biomass in the system. This relationship is not a simple consequence of the interdependence of both measures on body size and appears to be driven by the empirical pattern of size structuring in aquatic systems and the trophic position of each species in the web. Food web resolution also has an important effect, with aggregation of species into higher taxonomic groups producing a much weaker relationship. Food webs with fewer unique and less weakly interacting species also show significantly greater variability in their levels of primary production. Thus, the loss of highly unique, weakly interacting species may eventually lead to dramatic state changes and unpredictable levels of ecosystem functioning.","[O'Gorman, Eoin J.; Yearsley, Jon M.; Crowe, Tasman P.] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Sci Ctr W, Dublin 4, Ireland; [O'Gorman, Eoin J.; Petchey, Owen L.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Emmerson, Mark C.] Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Environm Res Inst, Cork, Ireland; [Emmerson, Mark C.] Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Dept Zool Ecol & Plant Sci, Cork, Ireland; [Emmerson, Mark C.] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol Sci, Med & Biol Ctr, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland; [Jacob, Ute] Univ Hamburg, Inst Hydrobiol & Fisheries Sci, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany",31,10.1098/rspb.2010.2036,2011

Of these, fishing is one of the most pervasive, and a growing body of work suggests that fishing can have strong effects on the ecology of target species, especially top predators. However, the effects of removing top predators on lower trophic groups of prey fishes are less clear, particularly in highly diverse and trophically complex coral reef ecosystems. We examined patterns of abundance, size structure, and age-based demography through surveys and collection-based studies of five fish species from a variety of trophic levels at Kiritimati and Palmyra, two nearby atolls in the Northern Line Islands. These islands have similar biogeography and oceanography, and yet Kiritimati has similar to 10,000 people with extensive local fishing while Palmyra is a US National Wildlife Refuge with no permanent human population, no fishing, and an intact predator fauna. Surveys indicated that top predators were relatively larger and more abundant at unfished Palmyra, while prey functional groups were relatively smaller but showed no clear trends in abundance as would be expected from classic trophic cascades. Through detailed analyses of focal species, we found that size and longevity of a top predator were lower at fished Kiritimati than at unfished Palmyra. Demographic patterns also shifted dramatically for 4 of 5 fish species in lower trophic groups, opposite in direction to the top predator, including decreases in average size and longevity at Palmyra relative to Kiritimati. Overall, these results suggest that fishing may alter community structure in complex and non-intuitive ways, and that indirect demographic effects should be considered more broadly in ecosystem-based management.","[Ruttenberg, Benjamin I.; Hamilton, Scott L.; Donovan, Mary K.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Ruttenberg, Benjamin I.] SE Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Miami, FL USA; [Hamilton, Scott L.] Moss Landing Marine Labs, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA; [Walsh, Sheila M.; Sandin, Stuart A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Donovan, Mary K.; Friedlander, Alan] Univ Hawaii, US Geol Survey, Hawaii Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [DeMartini, Edward] Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Aiea, HI USA; [Sala, Enric] Consejo Super Invest Cient, Ctr Estudis Avancats Blanes, Blanes, Spain; [Sala, Enric] Natl Geog Soc, Washington, DC USA",32,10.1371/journal.pone.0021062,2011

As juveniles, the offspring of predator-exposed mothers exhibited tighter shoaling behaviour, an antipredator defence. We did not detect an effect of maternal exposure to predation risk on the somatic growth of fry. Altogether, we found that exposure to an ecologically relevant stressor during egg formation had several long-lasting consequences for offspring, some of which might be mediated by exposure to maternally derived cortisol.

The complexities of this degradation have been studied in detail, but little work has assessed characteristics that allow reefs to bounce back and recover between pulse disturbance events. We quantitatively review recovery rates of coral cover from pulse disturbance events among 48 different reef locations, testing the relative roles of disturbance characteristics, reef characteristics, connectivity and anthropogenic influences. Reefs in the western Pacific Ocean had the fastest recovery, whereas reefs in the geographically isolated eastern Pacific Ocean were slowest to recover, reflecting regional differences in coral composition, fish functional diversity and geographic isolation. Disturbances that opened up large areas of benthic space recovered quickly, potentially because of nonlinear recovery where recruitment rates were high. The type of disturbance had a limited effect on subsequent rates of reef recovery, although recovery was faster following crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks. This inconsequential role of disturbance type may be in part due to the role of unaltered structural complexity in maintaining key reef processes, such as recruitment and herbivory. Few studies explicitly recorded potential ecological determinants of recovery, such as recruitment rates, structural complexity of habitat and the functional composition of reef-associated fish. There was some evidence of slower recovery rates within protected areas compared with other management systems and fished areas, which may reflect the higher initial coral cover in protected areas rather than reflecting a management effect. A better understanding of the driving role of processes, structural complexity and diversity on recovery may enable more appropriate management actions that support coral-dominated ecosystems in our changing climate.","[Graham, N.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether habitat-specific acoustic cues were involved in the nocturnal movements of juvenile reef fish to small experimental patch reefs that were broadcasting sound previously recorded from different habitats (Fringing Reef, Lagoon, Silent). Juvenile fish arriving at each patch reef were caught the next morning by divers and were identified. There were a greater number of occasions when juvenile fish (from all species together) moved onto the patch reefs broadcasting Fringing Reef and Lagoon sound (43 and 38%, respectively) compared to Silent reefs (19%) (chi(2) = 33.5; P < 0.05). There were significantly more occasions when juvenile fish from the family Nemipteridae were attracted to the patch reefs broadcasting Lagoon sound (63%) versus those reefs broadcasting either Fringing Reef sound (31%) or Silent (6%).

These results indicate that some juvenile fish use specific habitat sounds to guide their nocturnal movements. Therefore, the fish are able to not only use the directional information contained in acoustic cues, but can also interpret the content of the acoustic signals for relevant habitat information which is then used in their decision-making for orientation.","[Radford, C.

Adequate understanding of herbivory will mandate better knowledge of how specific herbivores impact reef communities and the redundancy versus complementarity of their ecological roles. We used algal communities generated by herbivore manipulations to assess such roles among Caribbean herbivorous fishes. We created large enclosures on a 16- to 18-m-deep reef to create treatments grazed for 10 months by: (1) only Sparisoma aurofrenatum, (2) only Acanthurus bahianus, (3) no large herbivorous fishes, or (4) natural densities of all reef fishes. After 10 months, we removed cages and filmed how free-ranging reef fishes fed among these treatments that differed in algal community structure. In general, Acanthurus spp. and Scarus spp. rapidly grazed exclosure and Sparisoma-only treatments, while Sparisoma spp. preferentially grazed exclosure and Acanthurus-only treatments. These patterns suggest complementarity between Sparisoma spp. and both Acanthurus spp. and Scarus spp. but redundancy between Acanthurus spp. and Scarus spp. Despite these generalities, there was also within-genera variance in response to the different treatments. For example, large Scarus spp., such as Scarus guacamaia, fed more similarly to Sparisoma spp., particularly Sparisoma viride, than to other Scarus spp. Moreover, the three common Sparisoma species differed considerably in the macroalgae to which they exhibited positive or negative relationships. Thus, herbivorous reef fishes vary considerably in their response to different algal communities and exhibit complex patterns of compensatory feeding and functional redundancy that are poorly predicted by taxonomy alone.","[Burkepile, D.

Thus, a worrisome scenario on demographic and genetic consequences may be expected from habitat degradation in the context of global change and human pressure increases.","[Fauvelot, C.] Univ Antilles Guyane, IRD, UR227, Equipe DYNECAR,Lab Biol Marine, Campus Fouillole,BP 592, F-97159 Pointe a Pitre, Guadeloupe, Guadeloupe; [Pini, J.] Univ Perpignan, Ctr Biol & Ecol Trop & Mediterraneenne, IRD, UR227, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Pini, J.; Planes, S.; Rochel, E.; Lecchini, D.] CRIOBE, EPHE, CNRS, USR3278, Moorea, Polynesie Franc, France; [Lecchini, D.] Ctr Noumea, IRD, UR227, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia; [Fauvelot, C.] Univ Antilles Guyane, IRD, UR227, DYNECAR EA 926,Lab Biol Marine, F-97159 Pointe a Pitre, Guadeloupe, Guadeloupe",8,10.1007/s00338-011-0718-6,2011

Given that corals in the Persian Gulf exist in one of the most stressful environments for reef corals, with annual variations in sea surface temperature (SST) of 12A degrees C and maximum summer mean SSTs of 36A degrees C, understanding coral reproductive biology in the Gulf may provide clues as to how corals may cope with global warming. In this study, we examined six locally common coral species on two shallow reef sites in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), in 2008 and 2009 to investigate the patterns of reproduction, in particular the timing and synchrony of spawning. In total, 71% colonies in April 2008 and 63% colonies in April 2009 contained mature oocytes. However, the presence of mature gametes in May indicated that spawning was potentially split between April and May in all species. These results demonstrate that coral reproduction patterns within this region are highly seasonal and that multi-species spawning synchrony is highly probable. Acropora downingi, Cyphastrea microphthalma and Platygyra daedalea were all hermaphroditic broadcast spawners with a single annual gametogenic cycle. Furthermore, fecundity and mature oocyte sizes were comparable to those in other regions. We conclude that the reproductive biology of corals in the southern Persian Gulf is similar to other regions, indicating that these species have adapted to the extreme environmental conditions in the southern Persian Gulf.","[Bauman, A.

Previous studies have concluded that zooplanktivores have larger eyes for sharper visual acuity, reduced mouth structures to match small prey sizes, and longer gill rakers to help retain captured prey. We tested these three traditional hypotheses plus two novel adaptive hypotheses in labrids, a clade of very diverse coral reef fishes that show multiple independent evolutionary origins of zooplanktivory. Using phylogenetic comparative methods with a data set from 21 species, we failed to find larger eyes in three independent transitions to zooplanktivory. Instead, an impression of large eyes may be caused by a size reduction of the anterior facial region. However, two zooplanktivores (Clepticus parrae and Halichoeres pictus) possess several features interpreted as adaptations to zooplankton feeding, namely large lens diameters relative to eye axial length, round pupil shape, and long gill rakers. The third zooplanktivore in our analysis, Cirrhilabrus solorensis, lacks all above features. It remains unclear whether Cirrhilabrus shows optical specializations for capturing planktonic prey. Our results support the prediction that increased visual acuity is adaptive for zooplanktivory, but in labrids increases in eye size are apparently not part of the evolutionary response.","[Schmitz, L.; Wainwright, P.

Regression analysis using an exponential curve considering three degradability pools (labile, semilabile, and refractory) fitted the changes of the TOC concentrations very well (r (2) > 0.99). Compiling the data on the two coral species, the labile organic C in the coral mucus had mineralization rates of 10-18% d(-1) and accounted for 79-87% of the initial TOC in the mucus. Semilabile organic C had mineralization rates of 0.3-1.6% d(-1) and accounted for 11-18% of the initial TOC. Refractory organic C accounted for 6% at most.

Time of release, swimming speeds, phototaxis and vertical migration were quantified for larvae of the dictyoceratid sponge Coscinoderma matthewsi. The influence of cues associated with biofilms and coral rubble on larval settlement and metamorphosis was also measured. C. matthewsi is a brooding sponge and releases tufted parenchymellae larvae during the day. Upon release, larvae (> 90%) have no phototactic response, maintaining their position at the water surface for 80 min +/- A 0 (mean +/- A SE) regardless of a light cue (natural daylight) before exhibiting negative phototaxis. At 28 h post-release, the majority of larvae (94.7% +/- A 6.1) exposed to light from the surface migrated to the bottom and assumed a demersal phase. Without light, larvae occupied the surface for up to 28 h post-release (89.3% +/- A 1.8) before migrating to the bottom. Larvae did not settle gregariously and began to settle and metamorphose after 28 h post-release without a cue. Settlement and metamorphosis were faster in the presence of a biofilm (settlement = 15.0% +/- A 8.7 and metamorphosis = 12.5% +/- A 9.5 at 28 h post-release), while the addition of coral rubble accelerated metamorphosis further (settlement = 10.0% +/- A 4.1 and metamorphosis = 27.5% +/- A 10.3 at 28 h post-release) compared to controls (sterile surfaces) (settlement = 0% and metamorphosis = 0% at 28 h post-release). However, both biofilms and coral rubble decrease total metamorphosis (control = 92.5% +/- A 4.8, biofilms = 67.5% +/- A 7.5 and coral rubble = 55.0% +/- A 13.2) due to mortality after 76 h post-release.","[Wahab, M.

Few studies have the spatial and temporal extent to directly compare the effects of multiple disturbances over a large geographic scale. Here, benthic communities and butterflyfishes on 47 reefs of the Great Barrier Reef were surveyed annually to examine their responses to physical disturbances (cyclones and storms) and/or biological disturbances (bleaching, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish and white syndrome disease). The effects on benthic and butterflyfish communities varied among reefs depending on the structure and geographical setting of each community, on the size and type of disturbance, and on the disturbance history of that reef. There was considerable variability in the response of butterflyfishes to different disturbances: physical disturbances (occurring with or without biological disturbances) produced substantial declines in abundance, whilst biological disturbances occurring on their own did not. Butterflyfishes with the narrowest feeding preferences, such as obligate corallivores, were always the species most affected. The response of generalist feeders varied with the extent of damage. Wholesale changes to the butterflyfish community were only recorded where structural complexity of reefs was drastically reduced. The observed effects of disturbances on butterflyfishes coupled with predictions of increased frequency and intensity of disturbances sound a dire warning for the future of butterflyfish communities in particular and reef fish communities in general.","[Emslie, M.

For this study, in situ video observations were used to assess the level to which fishes fed on diseased coral tissues at Lizard Island, northern Great Barrier Reef. Surveys conducted at multiple locations around Lizard Island revealed that coral disease prevalence, especially of brown band disease (BrB), was higher in lagoon and backreef locations than in exposed reef crests. Accordingly, video cameras were deployed in lagoon and backreef habitats to record feeding by fishes during 1-h periods on diseased sections of each of 44 different coral colonies. Twenty-five species from five fish families (Blennidae, Chaetodontidae, Gobiidae, Labridae and Pomacentridae) were observed to feed on infected coral tissues of staghorn species of Acropora that were naturally infected with black band disease (BBD) or brown band disease (BrB). Collectively, these fishes took an average of 18.6 (+/- 5.6 SE) and 14.3 (+/- 6.1 SE) bites per hour from BBD and BrB lesions, respectively. More than 40% (408/948 bites) and nearly 25% (314/1319 bites) of bites were observed on lesions associated with BBD and BrB, respectively, despite these bands each representing only about 1% of the substratum available. Moreover, many corallivorous fishes (Labrichthys unilineatus, Chaetodon aureofasciatus, C. baronessa, C. lunulatus, C. trifascialis, Cheiloprion labiatus) selectively targeted disease lesions over adjacent healthy coral tissues. These findings highlight the important role that reef fishes may play in the dynamics of coral diseases, either as vectors for the spread of coral disease or in reducing coral disease progression through intensive and selective consumption of diseased coral tissues.","[Chong-Seng, K.

Most attention on the effects of bleaching has focused on corals, but bleaching is also prevalent in other cnidarians, including sea anemones. The consequences of anemone bleaching are unknown, and the demographic effects of bleaching on associated fish recruitment, survival, and reproduction are poorly understood. We examined the effect of habitat degradation including host anemone bleaching on fish abundance, egg production, and recruitment of the panda anemonefish (Amphiprion polymnus) near Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. Following a high-temperature anomaly in shallow waters of the region, most shallow anemones to a depth of 6 m (approximately 35% of all the anemones in this area) were severely bleached. Anemone mortality was low but bleached anemones underwent a similar to 34% reduction in body size. Total numbers of A. polymnus were not affected by bleaching and reduction in shelter area. While egg production of females living in bleached anemones was reduced by similar to 38% in 2009 compared to 2008, egg production of females on unbleached anemones did not differ significantly between years. Total recruitment in 2009 was much lower than in 2008. However, we found no evidence of recruiting larvae avoiding bleached anemones at settlement suggesting that other factors or different chemical cues were more important in determining recruitment than habitat quality. These results provide the first field evidence of detrimental effects of climate-induced bleaching and habitat degradation on reproduction and recruitment of anemonefish.","[Saenz-Agudelo, P.; Planes, S.] Univ Perpignan, CNRS EPHE, CRIOBE, Ctr Biol & Ecol Tropicale & Mediterranneenne,USR, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Saenz-Agudelo, P.; Jones, G.

Natural refuges such as depth may also protect such species, yet few studies in the Indo Pacific have investigated the effects of depth concomitant with marine reserves. We studied the effects of artisanal fishing and depth on reef fish assemblages in the Kubulau District of Vanua Levu Island, Fiji, using baited remote underwater stereo-video systems. Video samples were collected from shallow (5-8 m) and deep (25-30 m) sites inside and outside of a large old marine reserve (60.6 km(2), 13 years old) and a small new marine reserve (4.25 km(2), 4 years old). Species richness tended to be greater in the shallow waters of the large old reserve when compared to fished areas. In the deeper waters, species richness appeared to be comparable. The difference in shallow waters was driven by species targeted by fisheries, indicative of a depth refuge effect. In contrast, differences in the abundance composition of the fish assemblage existed between protected and fished areas for deep sites, but not shallow. Fish species targeted by local fisheries were 89% more abundant inside the large old reserve than surrounding fished areas, while non-targeted species were comparable. We observed no difference in the species richness or abundance of species targeted by fisheries inside and outside of the small new reserve. This study suggests that artisanal fishing impacts on the abundance and species richness of coral reef fish assemblages and effects of protection are more apparent with large reserves that have been established for a long period of time. Observed effects of protection also vary with depth, highlighting the importance of explicitly incorporating multiple depth strata in studies of marine reserves.","[Goetze, J. S.; Langlois, T.

Because of high precision of the analytical system, not only the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (DOC and DON, respectively) but the C:N ratio was also determined from the distribution of DOC and DON concentrations. The observed concentrations of DOC and DON ranged 57-76 and 3.8-5.6 mu mol l(-1), respectively. The C:N ratios of the DOM that was produced on the reef flat were very similar between seagrass- and coral-dominated areas; the C:N ratio was 10 on average. The C:N ratio of DOM was significantly higher than that of particulate organic matter (POM) that was produced on the reef flat. Production rates of DOC were measured on the reef flat during stagnant periods and accounted for 3-7% of the net primary production, depending on the sampling site. The production rate of DON was estimated to be 10-30% of the net uptake of dissolved inorganic N in the reef community. Considering that the DOM and POM concentrations were not correlated with each other, a major source of the reef-derived DOM may be the benthic community and not POM such as phytoplankton. It was concluded that a widely distributed benthic community in the coral reef released C-rich DOM to the overlying seawater, conserving N in the community.","[Tanaka, Y.; Watanabe, A.; Nadaoka, K.; Yamamoto, T.] Tokyo Inst Technol, Grad Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1528552, Japan; [Miyajima, T.; Ogawa, H.] Univ Tokyo, Marine Biogeochem Lab, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Chiba 2778564, Japan",20,10.1007/s00338-011-0735-5,2011

We tested whether S. tortugarum reduced male allocation when transplanted from a higher density site to a lower density site. After 4 months, transplants mirrored the sex-allocation patterns of the resident population on their new reef. Transplants had significantly lower male allocation than representatives from their source population, largely as a result of reduced testis mass relative to body size.","[Hart, M.

The data were analyzed for spatial and temporal patterns of temperature variation, and a simple heat budget analysis was performed with the goal of advancing our understanding of the physical processes that control temperature variability on the reef. In 2009 and 2010, temperature variability on Red Sea reef platforms was dominated by diurnal variability. The daily temperature range on the reefs, at times, exceeded 5A degrees C-as large as the annual range of water temperature on the shelf. Additionally, our observations reveal the proximity of distinct thermal microclimates within the bounds of one reef platform. Circulation on the reef flat is largely wave driven. The greatest diurnal variation in water temperature occurs in the center of larger reef flats and on reefs protected from direct wave forcing, while smaller knolls or sites on the edges of the reef flat tend to experience less diurnal temperature variability. We found that both the temporal and spatial variability in water temperature on the reef platforms is well predicted by a heat budget model that includes the transfer of heat at the air-water interface and the advection of heat by currents flowing over the reef. Using this simple model, we predicted the temperature across three different reefs to within 0.4A degrees C on the outer shelf using only information about bathymetry, surface heat flux, and offshore wave conditions.","[Davis, K.

One method of demonstrating mass-transfer limitation of P-uptake is to show dependence of P-uptake on water velocity. Water velocity across reef flats varies with tides and swell; thus, we measured P-uptake over the entire reef flat on eight different days, representing a range in water velocities. P-uptake was calculated from changes in P concentration of the water column. Changes in P concentration were measured by water sampling at six sites along a 300-m cross-reef transect while simultaneously measuring water velocity. To smooth the variability in phosphate concentrations, peristaltic pumps were used to get time-integrated water samples for 4-6 h at each site. Water velocities were measured in the middle of the transect using an acoustic Doppler current profiler and were averaged to match the time-integrated water sampling. Depth-averaged cross-reef water velocities were 0.031 +/- A 0.013 m s(-1) (mean +/- A SD), while the root-mean-square water velocities, accounting for oscillatory flow, averaged 3.3 times higher, 0.101 +/- A 0.021 m s(-1) (mean +/- A SD). Phosphate decreased along all transects. The first-order rate constant for P-uptake (S) was 8.5 +/- A 2.4 m d(-1) (mean +/- A SD) and increased linearly with root-mean-square water velocity. The Stanton number derived from oscillatory flow, the ratio of the first-order rate constant for P-uptake to the root-mean-square water velocity (S/U (rms)), was (9.4 +/- A 1.2) x 10(-4) (mean +/- A SD).

Water samples were collected offshore in the ocean, at the reef crest and back reef for nutrients, picoplankton, pH, and total alkalinity. Volume transport of ocean water across the reef flat was measured using both current meters and drogues. Groundwater advected onto the reef flat and mixed with incoming ocean water. Metabolic rates for the reef community were determined to be: gross primary production = 1,000 mmol C m(-2) d(-1), community respiration = 960 mmol C m(-2) d(-1), and community calcification = 210 mmol C m(-2) d(-1). Across the reef flat, silicate behaved conservatively, there was net uptake of phosphate (0.06 mmol P m(-2) d(-1)) and net release of nitrate, ammonia, dissolved and particulate organic nitrogen (total 7.0 mmol N m(-2) d(-1)). Groundwater nitrate contributed 37% of the increase in nitrate plus ammonia. The first-order mass transfer coefficient of phosphate was 3.3 m d(-1), and for nitrate plus ammonia, 5.9 m d(-1). Gross N and P uptake from estimates of mass transfer and uptake of particles were 0.37 mmol P m(-2) d(-1) and 7.2 mmol N m(-2) d(-1), respectively giving an N:P uptake ratio of 20:1. Thus, the elevation of nitrogen across the reef flat maintains a high N:P flux, enhancing algal growth downstream of the transect. We conclude that net community production (40 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)) was sustained by net uptake of phosphate from the ocean and net uptake of new nitrogen from groundwater.","[Atkinson, M.

Coupled hydrodynamic and sediment-transport numerical modeling is consistent with recent published results that suggest that an increase in water depth on the order of 0.5-1.0 m on a 1-2 m deep exposed fringing reef flat would result in larger significant wave heights and setup, further elevating water depths on the reef flat. Larger waves would generate higher near-bed shear stresses, which, in turn, would result in an increase in both the size and the quantity of sediment that can be resuspended from the seabed or eroded from adjacent coastal plain deposits. Greater wave- and wind-driven currents would develop with increasing water depth, increasing the alongshore and offshore flux of water and sediment from the inner reef flat to the outer reef flat and fore reef where coral growth is typically greatest. Sediment residence time on the fringing reef flat was modeled to decrease exponentially with increasing sea-level rise as the magnitude of sea-level rise approached the mean water depth over the reef flat. The model results presented here suggest that a 0.5-1.0 m rise in sea level will likely increase coastal erosion, mixing and circulation, the amount of sediment resuspended, and the duration of high turbidity on exposed reef flats, resulting in decreased light availability for photosynthesis, increased sediment-induced stress on the reef ecosystem, and potentially affecting a number of other ecological processes.","[Storlazzi, C.

Coral disease surveys were conducted at 142 sites from across the Archipelago and disease patterns examined. Twelve diseases were recorded from three coral genera (Porites, Montipora, Acropora) with Porites having the highest prevalence. Porites growth anomalies (PorGAs) were significantly more prevalent within and indicative of reefs in the MHI and Porites trematodiasis (PorTrm) was significantly more prevalent within and indicative of reefs in the NWHI. Porites tissue loss syndrome (PorTLS) was also important in driving regional differences but that relationship was less clear. These results highlight the importance of understanding disease ecology when interpreting patterns of disease occurrence. PorTrm is caused by a parasitic flatworm that utilizes multiple hosts during its life cycle (fish, mollusk and coral). All three hosts must be present for the disease to occur and higher host abundance leads to higher disease prevalence. Thus, a high prevalence of PorTrm on Hawaiian reefs would be an indicator of a healthy coral reef ecosystem. In contrast, the high occurrence of PorGAs within the MHI suggests that PorGAs are related, directly or indirectly, to some environmental co-factor associated with increased human population sizes. Focusing on the three indicator diseases (PorGAs, PorTrm, PorTLS) we used statistical modeling to examine the underlying associations between disease prevalence and 14 different predictor variables (biotic and abiotic). All three diseases showed positive associations with host abundance and negative associations with thermal stress. The association with human population density differed among disease states with PorGAs showing a positive and PorTrm showing a negative association, but no significant explanatory power was offered for PorTLS.","[Aeby, Greta S.; Franklin, Erik C.] Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI USA; [Williams, Gareth J.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington, New Zealand; [Williams, Gareth J.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Ctr Marine Biodivers & Conservat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Kenyon, Jean] Univ Hawaii, Joint Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Kenyon, Jean] NOAA, Pacific Islands Fisheries Sci Ctr, Honolulu, HI USA; [Cox, Evelyn F.] Univ Hawaii W Oahu, Pearl City, HI USA; [Coles, Steve] Bernice P Bishop Museum, Honolulu, HI USA; [Work, Thierry M.] US Geol Survey, Natl Wildlife Hlth Ctr, Honolulu Field Stn, Honolulu, HI USA",35,10.1371/journal.pone.0020370,2011

Advances in marine remote sensing, together with the novel integration of landscape ecology and advanced niche modelling techniques provide an unprecedented opportunity to reliably model and map marine species distributions across many kilometres of coral reef ecosystems. We developed a multi-scale approach using three-dimensional seafloor morphology and across-shelf location to predict spatial distributions for five common Caribbean fish species. Seascape topography was quantified from high resolution bathymetry at five spatial scales (5-300 m radii) surrounding fish survey sites. Model performance and map accuracy was assessed for two high performing machine-learning algorithms: Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) and Maximum Entropy Species Distribution Modelling (MaxEnt). The three most important predictors were geographical location across the shelf, followed by a measure of topographic complexity. Predictor contribution differed among species, yet rarely changed across spatial scales. BRT provided 'outstanding' model predictions (AUC = > 0.9) for three of five fish species. MaxEnt provided 'outstanding' model predictions for two of five species, with the remaining three models considered 'excellent' (AUC = 0.8-0.9). In contrast, MaxEnt spatial predictions were markedly more accurate (92% map accuracy) than BRT (68% map accuracy). We demonstrate that reliable spatial predictions for a range of key fish species can be achieved by modelling the interaction between the geographical location across the shelf and the topographic heterogeneity of seafloor structure. This multi-scale, analytic approach is an important new cost-effective tool to accurately delineate essential fish habitat and support conservation prioritization in marine protected area design, zoning in marine spatial planning, and ecosystem-based fisheries management.","[Pittman, Simon J.] NOAA, Biogeog Branch, Ctr Coastal Monitoring & Assessment, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Pittman, Simon J.] Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine Sci, St Thomas, VI USA; [Brown, Kerry A.] Kingston Univ London, Sch Geog Geol & Environm, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, England",99,10.1371/journal.pone.0020583,2011

While male sex-specific coloration patterns have been documented in groupers, particularly during the spawning season, few data regarding social structure and the context for these color displays are available. In the present study, we define the social structure and male typical behavior of rock hind (Epinephelus adscensionis) in the wild. In addition, we detail the captive conditions and time period necessary to induce the onset of the sex-specific coloration and sexual change. At six oil production platform locations in the Gulf of Mexico, rock hind social group size and typical male rock hind social behavior were documented. We observed a rapid temporary color display in rock hind that could be turned on and off within three seconds and was used for confronting territory intruders and displays of aggression towards females. The male-specific ""tuxedo"" pattern consists of a bright yellow tail, a body with alternating dark brown and white patches and a dark bar extending from the upper mandible to the operculum. Identification and size ranges of male, female and intersex fish collected from oil platforms were determined in conjunction with gonadal histology. Rock hind social order is haremic with one dominant male defending a territory and a linear dominance hierarchy among individuals. In five captive experiments, the largest remaining female rock hind displayed the male specific color pattern within 32d after dominant male removal from the social group. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence in a grouper species of color patterning used to display territoriality and dominance outside of spawning aggregations. The behavioral paradigm described here is a key advance that will enable mechanistic studies of this complex sex change process.","[Kline, Richard J.; Holt, G.

Moreover, they are extraordinarily rich sources of bioactive secondary metabolites, with 35% of all reported cyanobacterial natural products deriving from this single pantropical genus. However, the true natural product potential and life strategies of Lyngbya strains are poorly understood because of phylogenetic ambiguity, lack of genomic information, and their close associations with heterotrophic bacteria and other cyanobacteria. To gauge the natural product potential of Lyngbya and gain insights into potential microbial interactions, we sequenced the genome of Lyngbya majuscula 3L, a Caribbean strain that produces the tubulin polymerization inhibitor curacin A and the molluscicide barbamide, using a combination of Sanger and 454 sequencing approaches. Whereas similar to 293,000 nucleotides of the draft genome are putatively dedicated to secondary metabolism, this is far too few to encode a large suite of Lyngbya metabolites, suggesting Lyngbya metabolites are strain specific and may be useful in species delineation. Our analysis revealed a complex gene regulatory network, including a large number of sigma factors and other regulatory proteins, indicating an enhanced ability for environmental adaptation or microbial associations. Although Lyngbya species are reported to fix nitrogen, nitrogenase genes were not found in the genome or by PCR of genomic DNA. Subsequent growth experiments confirmed that L. majuscula 3L is unable to fix atmospheric nitrogen. These unanticipated life history characteristics challenge current views of the genus Lyngbya.","[Jones, Adam C.; Monroe, Emily A.; Esquenazi, Eduardo; Gerwick, William H.; Gerwick, Lena] Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Marine Biotechnol & Biomed, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Podell, Sheila; Allen, Eric E.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Marine Biol Res Div, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Rothmann, Michael; Burkart, Michael D.; Dorrestein, Pieter C.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Chem & Biochem, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Allen, Eric E.] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Dorrestein, Pieter C.; Gerwick, William H.] Univ Calif San Diego, Skaggs Sch Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Hess, Wolfgang R.] Univ Freiburg, Inst Biol 3, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Klages, Sven; Kube, Michael] Max Planck Inst Mol Genet, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Reinhardt, Richard] Scripps Res Inst, Ctr Physiol Prote, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Lasken, Roger S.] J Craig Venter Inst, San Diego, CA 92121 USA; [Niessen, Sherry; Hoover, Heather; Yates, John R., III] MPI Plant Breeding Res, Genome Ctr Cologne, D-50829 Cologne, Germany",64,10.1073/pnas.1101137108,2011

Several local removal programs have been initiated to control this invasion, but it is not known whether removal efforts can substantially reduce lionfish numbers to ameliorate these concerns. We used an age-structured population model to evaluate the potential efficacy of lionfish removal programs and identified critical data gaps for future studies. We used high and low estimates for uncertain parameters including: length at 50% vulnerability to harvest (L(vul)), instantaneous natural mortality (M), and the Goodyear compensation ratio (CR). The model predicted an annual exploitation rate between 35 and 65% would be required to cause recruitment overfishing on lionfish populations for our baseline parameter estimates for M and CR (0.5 and 15). Lionfish quickly recovered from high removal rates, reaching 90% of unfished biomass six years after a 50-year simulated removal program. Quantifying lionfish natural mortality and the size-selective vulnerability to harvest are the most important knowledge gaps for future research. We suggest complete eradication of lionfish through fishing is unlikely, and substantial reduction of adult abundance will require a long-term commitment and may be feasible only in small, localized areas where annual exploitation can be intense over multiple consecutive years.","[Barbour, Andrew B.; Allen, Michael S.; Frazer, Thomas K.] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Fisheries & Aquat Sci Program, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Sherman, Krista D.] Bahamas Natl Trust, Nassau, Bahamas",83,10.1371/journal.pone.0019666,2011

In contrast, the closely related black corals (Hexacorallia: Anthipatharia) are described as azooxanthellate (lacking Symbiodinium), a trait thought to reflect their preference for low-light environments that do not support photosynthesis. We examined 14 antipatharian species collected between 10 and 396 m from Hawai'i and Johnston Atoll for the presence of Symbiodinium using molecular typing and histology. Symbiodinium internal transcribed spacer-2 (ITS-2) region sequences were retrieved from 43 per cent of the antipatharian samples and 71 per cent of the examined species, and across the entire depth range. The ITS-2 sequences were identical or very similar to those commonly found in shallow-water scleractinian corals throughout the Pacific. Histological analyses revealed low densities of Symbiodinium cells inside antipatharian gastrodermal tissues (0-92 cells mm(-3)), suggesting that the Symbiodinium are endosymbiotic. These findings confirm that the capacity to engage in endosymbiosis with Symbiodinium is evolutionarily conserved across the cnidarian subclass Hexacorallia, and that antipatharians associate with Symbiodinium types found in shallow-water scleractinians. This study represents the deepest record for Symbiodinium to date, and suggests that some members of this dinoflagellate genus have extremely diverse habitat preferences and broad environmental ranges.","[Wagner, Daniel] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Wagner, Daniel; Pochon, Xavier; Toonen, Robert J.; Gates, Ruth D.] Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; [Irwin, Leslie] Univ Delaware, Coll Earth Ocean & Environm, Newark, DE 19716 USA",14,10.1098/rspb.2010.1681,2011

We examined the influence of water temperature on growth-related early life history traits (ELHTs) and differential mortality during the transition from larval to early juvenile stage in sixteen monthly cohorts of bicolor damselfish Stegastes partitus, sampled on reefs of the upper Florida Keys, USA over 6 years. Otolith analysis of settlers and juveniles coupled with environmental data revealed that mean near-reef water temperature explained a significant proportion of variation in pelagic larval duration (PLD), early larval growth, size-at-settlement, and growth during early juvenile life. Among all cohorts, surviving juveniles were consistently larger at settlement, but grew more slowly during the first 6 d post-settlement. For the other ELHTs, selective mortality varied seasonally: during winter and spring months, survivors exhibited faster larval growth and shorter PLDs, whereas during warmer summer months, selection on PLD reversed and selection on larval growth became non-linear. Our results demonstrate that temperature not only shapes growth-related traits, but can also influence the direction and intensity of selective mortality.","[Rankin, Tauna L.; Sponaugle, Su] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA",25,10.1371/journal.pone.0016814,2011

Detection of very small and cryptic fish decreased strongly 1 m away from the line. Conversely, sightings of shy and large species were excessively low in the first meters due to diver avoidance prior to detection. The larger the fish, the greater the fleeing distance.

These techniques, however, have inherent problems that make it difficult to collect accurate numerical data. One of these problems is the diver effect (defined as the reaction of fish to a diver). Although widely recognised, its effects have yet to be quantified and the extent of taxonomic variation remains to be determined. We therefore examined relative diver effects on a reef fish assemblage on the Great Barrier Reef. Using common UVC methods, the recorded abundance of seven reef fish groups were significantly affected by the ongoing presence of SCUBA divers. Overall, the diver effect resulted in a 52% decrease in the mean number of individuals recorded, with declines of up to 70% in individual families. Although the diver effect appears to be a significant problem, UVCs remain a useful approach for quantifying spatial and temporal variation in relative fish abundances, especially if using methods that minimise the exposure of fishes to divers. Fixed distance transects using tapes or lines deployed by a second diver (or GPS-calibrated timed swims) would appear to maximise fish counts and minimise diver effects.","[Dickens, Luke C.; Goatley, Christopher H.

Cleaning associations between sharks and teleosts are poorly understood, but the observable interactions seen at this site may explain why these mainly oceanic sharks regularly venture into shallow coastal waters where they are vulnerable to disturbance from human activity. From 1,230 hours of observations recorded by remote video camera between July 2005 and December 2009, 97 cleaner-thresher shark events were analyzed, 19 of which were interrupted. Observations of pelagic thresher sharks interacting with cleaners at the seamount were recorded at all times of day but their frequency declined gradually from morning until evening. Cleaners showed preferences for foraging on specific areas of a thresher shark's body. For all events combined, cleaners were observed to conduct 2,757 inspections, of which 33.9% took place on the shark's pelvis, 23.3% on the pectoral fins, 22.3% on the caudal fin, 8.6% on the body, 8.3% on the head, 2.1% on the dorsal fin, and 1.5% on the gills respectively. Cleaners did not preferentially inspect thresher sharks by time of day or by shark sex, but there was a direct correlation between the amount of time a thresher shark spent at a cleaning station and the number of inspections it received. Thresher shark clients modified their behavior by ""circular-stance-swimming,'' presumably to facilitate cleaner inspections. The cleaner-thresher shark association reflected some of the known behavioral trends in the cleaner-reef teleost system since cleaners appeared to forage selectively on shark clients. Evidence is mounting that in addition to acting as social refuges and foraging grounds for large visiting marine predators, seamounts may also support pelagic ecology by functioning as cleaning stations for oceanic sharks and rays.","[Oliver, Simon P.; Turner, John R.] Univ Wales, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge, Anglesey, Wales; [Oliver, Simon P.; Beckett, Alison J.] Thresher Shark Res & Conservat Project, Malapascua Isl, Cebu, Philippines; [Hussey, Nigel E.] Univ Windsor, Great Lakes Inst Environm Res, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada; [Beckett, Alison J.] Univ Liverpool, Sch Biomed Sci, Nuffield BD, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England",14,10.1371/journal.pone.0014755,2011

Most obvious among changes to reefs is loss of hard coral cover, but a precise multi-scale estimate of coral cover dynamics for the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is currently lacking. Monitoring data collected annually from fixed sites at 47 reefs across 1300 km of the GBR indicate that overall regional coral cover was stable (averaging 29% and ranging from 23% to 33% cover across years) with no net decline between 1995 and 2009. Subregional trends (10-100 km) in hard coral were diverse with some being very dynamic and others changing little. Coral cover increased in six subregions and decreased in seven subregions. Persistent decline of corals occurred in one subregion for hard coral and Acroporidae and in four subregions in non-Acroporidae families. Change in Acroporidae accounted for 68% of change in hard coral. Crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) outbreaks and storm damage were responsible for more coral loss during this period than either bleaching or disease despite two mass bleaching events and an increase in the incidence of coral disease. While the limited data for the GBR prior to the 1980's suggests that coral cover was higher than in our survey, we found no evidence of consistent, system-wide decline in coral cover since 1995. Instead, fluctuations in coral cover at subregional scales (10-100 km), driven mostly by changes in fast-growing Acroporidae, occurred as a result of localized disturbance events and subsequent recovery.","[Osborne, Kate; Dolman, Andrew M.; Burgess, Scott C.; Johns, Kerryn A.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia",120,10.1371/journal.pone.0017516,2011

In much of the literature where sediment traps were used to measure the effects of ""sedimentation"" on corals, it is clear from deployment descriptions and interpretations of the resulting data that information derived from sediment traps has frequently been misinterpreted or misapplied. Despite their widespread use in this setting, sediment traps do not provide quantitative information about ""sedimentation"" on coral surfaces. Traps can provide useful information about the relative magnitude of sediment dynamics if trap deployment standards are used. This conclusion is based first on a brief review of the state of knowledge of sediment trap dynamics, which has primarily focused on traps deployed high above the seabed in relatively deep water, followed by our understanding of near-bed sediment dynamics in shallow-water environments that characterize coral reefs. This overview is followed by the first synthesis of near-bed sediment trap data collected with concurrent hydrodynamic information in coral reef environments. This collective information is utilized to develop nine protocols for using sediment traps in coral reef environments, which focus on trap parameters that researchers can control such as trap height (H), trap mouth diameter (D), the height of the trap mouth above the substrate (z (o) ), and the spacing between traps. The hydrodynamic behavior of sediment traps and the limitations of data derived from these traps should be forefront when interpreting sediment trap data to infer sediment transport processes in coral reef environments.","[Storlazzi, C.

In response, gross primary production (P) for the reef flat community also decreased sevenfold, varying linearly with light (r (2) = 0.92, n = 12). Community respiration (R) decreased fivefold over this same period and was highly correlated with changes in P (r (2) = 0.84, n = 12). We reason that this short-term coherence between P and R indicates that most of the carbon fixed during this period was rapidly metabolized via plant respiration. We further conclude that the dominance of autotrophic respiration under general conditions of nutrient-limited growth can explain much of the balance between P and R that is commonly observed in shallow reef communities.","[Falter, J.

Dominant biota covering dead carbonate substrates were in decreasing order of importance: turfs on endoliths, turfs on crustose corallines, and crustose corallines. On the reef crest and shallow fore reef, composition of the biota changed seasonally. Cover of turfs on endoliths and turfs on crustose corallines was higher during the hot season, while crustose corallines and macroalgae (only on reef crest) increased during the cool season. Biota in the deep fore reef did not show seasonal variation. All life phases used similar resources and showed selective feeding in all zones. Turfs on endoliths, followed by turfs on crustose corallines, was the primary feeding substrate. These two sources represented over 92% of bites during both seasons. Crustose corallines, macroalgae, and living corals were negligible components being strongly avoided at all zones and seasons. Resource use varied seasonally on the reef crest and shallow fore reef, while it remained unchanged on the deep fore reef. Turfs on endoliths were consistently preferred in both seasons but their contribution increased from 45% in the cool to 70% of bites in the hot season. Electivity for turfs on crustose corallines shifted from random feeding in the hot (27% of bites) to selection in the cool season (47% of bites). Feeding pattern changed diurnally with more bites taken from crustose corallines and turfs on crustose corallines during morning. During the rest of the day, bites from turfs on endoliths predominate. S. ferrugineus shows limited capacity to exploit seasonal increases in the biomass of foliose and canopy forming macroalgae, despite indications of energetic limitation during the cool season.","[Afeworki, Y.; Videler, J.

Do such dietary divergences result from differences in foraging habitats, or reflect differential ability to locate, capture or ingest different types of prey? That question is difficult to answer if foraging occurs in places that preclude direct observation. In New Caledonia, amphibious sea kraits (Laticauda laticaudata and L. saintgironsi) mostly eat eels-but the species consumed differ between snake species and vary with snake body size and sex. Because the snakes capture eels within crevices on the sea floor, it is not possible to observe snake foraging on any quantitative basis. We used stable isotopes to investigate habitat-divergence and ontogenetic shifts in feeding habits of sympatric species of sea kraits. Similarities in delta 15 N (similar to 10.5aEuro degrees) values suggest that the two snake species occupy similar trophic levels in the coral-reef foodweb. However, delta 13C values differed among the eight eel species consumed by snakes, as well as between the two snake species, and were linked to habitat types. Specifically, delta 13C differed between soft- vs. hard-substrate eel species, and consistently differed between the soft-bottom forager L. laticaudata (similar to -14.7aEuro degrees) and the hard-bottom forager L. saintgironsi (similar to-12.5aEuro degrees). Differences in isotopic signatures within and between the two sea krait species and their prey were consistent with the hypothesis of habitat-based dietary divergence. Isotopic composition varied with body size within each of the snake species and varied with body size within some eel species, reflecting ontogenetic shifts in feeding habits of both the sea kraits and their prey. Our results support the findings of previous studies based on snake stomach contents, indicating that further studies could usefully expand these isotopic analyses to a broader range of trophic levels, fish species and spatial scales.","[Brischoux, F.; Bonnet, X.; Cherel, Y.] CNRS, UPR 1934, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France; [Brischoux, F.; Shine, R.] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",16,10.1007/s00338-010-0680-8,2011

In Moorea, French Polynesia, frequent disturbances between 1979 and 2003 caused marked shifts in taxonomic composition of coral assemblages. This study explores recent changes in live cover and taxonomic structure of coral communities on the north coast of Moorea, French Polynesia, to assess whether coral assemblages are recovering (returning to a previous Acropora-dominated state) or continuing to move towards an alternative community structure. Coral cover declined by 29.7% between July 2003 and March 2009, mostly due to loss of Acropora and Montipora spp. Coral mortality varied among habitats, with highest levels of coral loss on the outer reef slope (7-20 m depth). In contrast, there was limited change in coral cover within the lagoon, and coral cover actually increased on the reef crest. Observed changes in coral cover and composition correspond closely with the known feeding preferences and observed spatial patterns of Acanthaster planci L., though observed coral loss also coincided with at least one episode of coral bleaching, as well as persistent populations of the corallivorous starfish Culcita novaeguineae Muller & Troschel. While climate change poses an important and significant threat to the future structure and dynamics coral reef communities, outbreaks of A. planci remain a significant cause of coral loss in Moorea. More importantly, these recent disturbances have followed long-term shifts in the structure of coral assemblages, and the relative abundance of both Pocillopora and Porites continue to increase due to disproportionate losses of Acropora and Montipora. Moreover, Pocillopora and Porites dominate assemblages of juvenile corals, suggesting that there is limited potential for a return to an Acropora-dominated state, last recorded in 1979.","[Pratchett, M.

A tetracycline experiment, using presettlement fish, demonstrated that increments were formed daily. Variation in PLD was low between reef clusters (0%), reefs within clusters (0.4-8.5%) and sites within reefs (13.1%), but high among individuals within sites (86.5-91.5%); PLD ranged from 15 to 27 days. It was predicted that PLD would vary at greater spatial scales, but differences were low and a review of all studies on P. coelestis in tropical waters had a similar range of PLDs to our study. Contrary to a hypothesis that fish with slower growth would have longer PLDs, there was no significant relationship between mean presettlement increment width of otoliths and PLD for fish from the two reef clusters examined. There were, however, differences in presettlement growth rates between reef clusters (over 100 km apart) over the last 5-6 days of planktonic life. Warmer waters at the Swain Reefs (0.1-1A degrees C) may have contributed to these differences in growth. Stochastic transport of larvae, habitat choice by presettlement fish in a reef mosaic, and variable conditions in the plankton may contribute to variation in PLD, presettlement growth and size-at-settlement in P. coelestis. We propose that prolonged periods of settlement choice may obscure simple relationships between PLD and size-at-settlement.","[Kingsford, M. J.; Smith, F. J.

The abundance of parrotfish grazing scars was highest on reef flat and crest, with massive Porites spp. colonies having more parrotfish grazing scars than all other coral species combined. Massive Porites was the only coral type positively selected for grazing by parrotfishes in all four reef zones. The density of parrotfish grazing scars on massive Porites spp., and the rate of new scar formation, was highest on the reef crest and flat, reflecting the lower massive Porites cover and higher parrotfish abundance in these habitats. Overall, it appears that parrotfish predation pressure on corals could affect the abundance of preferred coral species, especially massive Porites spp, across the reef gradient.

Fish abundance was measured in 25 sites along the forereef of Glovers Atoll (Belize).

The relationships between E1 and ISR, and between both E1 and ISR and the abundance of 17 common species and the presence of 10 uncommon species were tested. E1 was a significant predictor of the topographic complexity (r (2) = 0.66), the abundance of 10 common species of surgeonfishes, pomacentrids, scarids, grunts and serranids and the presence of 4 uncommon species of pomacentrids and snappers. Small differences in E1 (i.e. a dagger 0.05-0.07) reflected in subtle but significant differences in fish abundance (similar to 1 individual 200 m(-2) and 116 g 200 m(-2)) among sites.

Understanding how these environmental stressors have impacted coral skeletal growth should improve our ability to predict how they may affect coral reefs in the future. We investigated century-scale variations in skeletal extension for the slow-growing massive scleractinian coral Siderastrea siderea inhabiting the forereef, backreef, and nearshore reefs of the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (MBRS) in the western Caribbean Sea. Methodology/Principal Findings: Thirteen S. siderea cores were extracted, slabbed, and X-rayed. Annual skeletal extension was estimated from adjacent low-and high-density growth bands. Since the early 1900s, forereef S. siderea colonies have shifted from exhibiting the fastest to the slowest average annual skeletal extension, while values for backreef and nearshore colonies have remained relatively constant. The rates of change in annual skeletal extension were -0.020+/-0.005, 0.011+/-0.006, and -0.008+/-0.006 mm yr(-1) per year [mean+/-SE] for forereef, backreef, and nearshore colonies respectively. These values for forereef and nearshore S. siderea were significantly lower by 0.031+/-0.008 and by 0.019+/-0.009 mm yr(-1) per year, respectively, than for backreef colonies. However, only forereef S. siderea exhibited a statistically significant decline in annual skeletal extension over the last century. Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggest that forereef S. siderea colonies are more susceptible to environmental stress than backreef and nearshore counterparts, which may have historically been exposed to higher natural baseline stressors. Alternatively, sediment plumes, nutrients, and pollution originating from watersheds of Guatemala and Honduras may disproportionately impact the forereef environment of the MBRS. We are presently reconstructing the history of environmental stressors that have impacted the MBRS to constrain the cause(s) of the observed reductions in coral skeletal growth. This should improve our ability to predict and potentially mitigate the effects of future environmental stressors on coral reef ecosystems.","[Castillo, Karl D.; Ries, Justin B.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Marine Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Weiss, Jack M.] Univ N Carolina, Curriculum Environm & Ecol, Chapel Hill, NC USA",20,10.1371/journal.pone.0014615,2011

While the factors that drive spatial patterns in herbivory in terrestrial systems are well established, comparatively less is known about what influences the distribution of herbivory in coral reefs. Methodology and Principal Findings: We quantified spatial patterns of macroalgal consumption in a cross-section of Ningaloo Reef (Western Australia). We used a combination of descriptive and experimental approaches to assess the influence of multiple macroalgal traits and structural complexity in establishing the observed spatial patterns in macroalgal herbivory, and to identify potential feedback mechanisms between herbivory and macroalgal nutritional quality. Spatial patterns in macroalgal consumption were best explained by differences in structural complexity among habitats. The biomass of herbivorous fish, and rates of herbivory were always greater in the structurally-complex coral-dominated outer reef and reef flat habitats, which were also characterised by high biomass of herbivorous fish, low cover and biomass of macroalgae and the presence of unpalatable algae species. Macroalgal consumption decreased to undetectable levels within 75 m of structurally-complex reef habitat, and algae were most abundant in the structurally-simple lagoon habitats, which were also characterised by the presence of the most palatable algae species. In contrast to terrestrial ecosystems, herbivory patterns were not influenced by the distribution, productivity or nutritional quality of resources (macroalgae), and we found no evidence of a positive feedback between macroalgal consumption and the nitrogen content of algae. Significance: This study highlights the importance of seascape-scale patterns in structural complexity in determining spatial patterns of macroalgal consumption by fish. Given the importance of herbivory in maintaining the ability of coral reefs to reorganise and retain ecosystem functions following disturbance, structural complexity emerges as a critical feature that is essential for the healthy functioning of these ecosystems.","[Verges, Adriana] Univ New S Wales, Sydney Inst Marine Sci & Evolut, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Verges, Adriana] Univ New S Wales, Ecol Res Ctr, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Verges, Adriana; Vanderklift, Mathew A.; Hyndes, Glenn A.] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Ctr Marine Ecosyst Res, Joondalup, Australia; [Vanderklift, Mathew A.] CSIRO Wealth Oceans Flagship, Wembley, WA, Australia; [Doropoulos, Christopher] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Doropoulos, Christopher] Univ Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",41,10.1371/journal.pone.0017115,2011

We used longline surveys to quantify the shark assemblage at French Frigate Shoals (FFS) atoll from May to August 2009. Fishing effort consisted of 189 longline sets totaling 6,862 hook hours of soak time. A total of 221 sharks from 7 species were captured, among which Galapagos (Carcharhinus galapagensis, 36.2%), gray reef (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, 25.8%) and tiger (Galeocerdo cuvier, 20.4%) sharks were numerically dominant. A lack of blacktip reef sharks (Carcharhinus melanopterus) distinguished the FFS shark assemblage from those at many other atolls in the Indo-Pacific. Compared to prior underwater visual survey estimates, longline methods more accurately represented species abundance and composition for the majority of shark species. Sharks were significantly less abundant in the shallow lagoon than adjacent habitats. Recaptures of Galapagos sharks provided the first empirical estimate of population size for any Galapagos shark population. The overall recapture rate was 5.4%. Multiple closed population models were evaluated, with Chao M-h ranking best in model performance and yielding a population estimate of 668 sharks with 95% confidence intervals ranging from 289-1720. Low shark abundance in the shallow lagoon habitats suggests removal of a small number of sharks from the immediate vicinity of lagoonal islets may reduce short-term predation on endangered monk seal (Monachus schauinslandi) pups, but considerable fishing effort would be required to catch even a small number of sharks. Additional data on long-term movements and habitat use of sharks at FFS are required to better assess the likely ecological impacts of shark culling.","[Dale, Jonathan J.; Stankus, Austin M.; Burns, Michael S.; Meyer, Carl G.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI USA; [Dale, Jonathan J.; Stankus, Austin M.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Zool, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",14,10.1371/journal.pone.0016962,2011

These gobies are the biggest contributors to the diversity of fish communities in insular systems and have the highest levels of endemism, yet their phylogeny has not been explored before with molecular data. To understand the phylogeny and the biogeography of this subfamily, sequences from the mitochondrial 16S rDNA and cytochrome oxidase I and from the nuclear rhodopsin gene were obtained for 50 Sicydiinae specimens of seven genera. Our results support the monophyly of the subfamily and of all the genera except Sicyopus, which is polyphyletic. Five major clades were identified within this subfamily. One clade clusters Sicyopterus and Sicydium as sister genera, one contains the genus Stiphodon split into two different groups, two other clades include only Sicyopus (Smilosicyopus) and Cotylopus, respectively, and the last clade groups Akihito, Lentipes and Sicyopus (Sicyopus). As a result, the subgenus Smilosicyopus is elevated herein as a genus.

Upon entering a new environment, it is vitally important to be able to rapidly assess predation risk. Predation pressure should selectively promote mechanisms that enable the rapid identification of novel predators. Here we tested the ability of a juvenile marine fish to simultaneously learn the identity of multiple previously unknown predators. Individuals were conditioned with a 'cocktail' of novel odours (from two predators and two non-predators) paired with either a conspecific alarm cue or a saltwater control and then tested for recognition of the four odours individually and two novel odours (one predator and one non-predator) the following day. Individuals conditioned with the 'cocktail' and alarm cue responded to the individual 'cocktail' odours with an antipredator response compared to controls. These results demonstrate that individuals acquire recognition of novel odours and that the responses were not due to innate recognition of predators or due to a generalised response to novel odours. Upon entering an unfamiliar environment prey species are able to rapidly assess the risk of predation, enhancing their chances of survival, through the assessment of chemical stimuli.","[Mitchell, Matthew D.; McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, Australia Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Mitchell, Matthew D.; McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Ferrari, Maud C.

For example, the cnidarian class Anthozoa (corals and anemones) is mainly comprised of gonochoric (separate sex) brooders or spawners, while one order, Scleractinia (skeleton-forming corals), appears to be mostly hermaphroditic spawners. Here, using the most complete phylogeny of scleractinians, we reconstruct how evolutionary transitions between sexual systems (gonochorism versus hermaphrodism) and reproductive modes (brooding versus spawning) have generated large-scale taxonomic patterns in these characters. Hermaphrodites have independently evolved in three large, distantly related lineages consisting of mostly reef-building species. Reproductive mode in corals has evolved at twice the rate of sexuality, while the evolution of sexuality has been heavily biased: gonochorism is over 100 times more likely to be lost than gained, and can only be acquired by brooders. This circuitous evolutionary pathway accounts for the prevalence of hermaphroditic spawners among reef-forming scleractinians, despite their ancient gonochoric heritage.","[Kerr, Alexander M.] Univ Guam, Marine Lab, Mangilao, GU 96923 USA; [Kerr, Alexander M.; Baird, Andrew H.; Hughes, Terry P.] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",45,10.1098/rspb.2010.1196,2011

For the first time, we present direct evidence of large-scale population connectivity within an existing and effective network of MPAs. A new parentage analysis identified four parent-offspring pairs from a large, exploited population of the coral-reef fish Zebrasoma flavescens in Hawai'i, revealing larval dispersal distances ranging from 15 to 184 km. In two cases, successful dispersal was from an MPA to unprotected sites. Given high adult abundances, the documentation of any parent-offspring pairs demonstrates that ecologically-relevant larval connectivity between reefs is substantial. All offspring settled at sites to the north of where they were spawned. Satellite altimetry and oceanographic models from relevant time periods indicated a cyclonic eddy that created prevailing northward currents between sites where parents and offspring were found. These findings empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of MPAs as useful conservation and management tools and further highlight the importance of coupling oceanographic, genetic, and ecological data to predict, validate and quantify larval connectivity among marine populations.","[Christie, Mark R.; Albins, Mark A.; Hixon, Mark A.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Tissot, Brian N.] Washington State Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Vancouver, WA USA; [Beets, James P.] Univ Hawaii, Dept Marine Sci, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [Jia, Yanli] Univ Hawaii, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Ortiz, Delisse M.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Highly Migratory Species Management Div, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Thompson, Stephen E.] Marine Environm Res, Kailua, HI USA",112,10.1371/journal.pone.0015715,2010

To assess the impact of turf algae on corals, we investigated the effects of increased nutrients (eutrophication) on the interaction between the Caribbean coral Montastraea annularis and turf algae at their growth boundary. We also assessed whether herbivores are capable of reducing the abundance of turf algae at coral-algae boundaries. We found that turf algae cause visible (overgrowth) and invisible negative effects (reduced fitness) on neighbouring corals. Corals can overgrow neighbouring turf algae very slowly (at a rate of 0.12 mm 3 wk(-1)) at ambient nutrient concentrations, but turf algae overgrew corals (at a rate of 0.34 mm 3 wk(-1)) when nutrients were experimentally increased. Exclusion of herbivores had no measurable effect on the rate turf algae overgrew corals. We also used PAM fluorometry (a common approach for measuring of a colony's ""fitness"") to detect the effects of turf algae on the photophysiology of neighboring corals. Turf algae always reduced the effective photochemical efficiency of neighbouring corals, regardless of nutrient and/or herbivore conditions. The findings that herbivores are not capable of controlling the abundance of turf algae and that nutrient enrichment gives turf algae an overall competitive advantage over corals together have serious implications for the health of Caribbean coral reef systems. At ambient nutrient levels, traditional conservation measures aimed at reversing coral-to-algae phase shifts by reducing algal abundance (i.e., increasing herbivore populations by establishing Marine Protected Areas or tightening fishing regulations) will not necessarily reduce the negative impact of turf algae on local coral communities. Because turf algae have become the most abundant benthic group on Curacao (and likely elsewhere in the Caribbean), new conservation strategies are required to mitigate their negative impact on coral communities.","[Vermeij, Mark J.

Here we quantified habitat specificity of juvenile coral reef fish at three ecological levels; algal meadows vs. coral reefs, live vs. dead coral and among different coral morphologies. In total, 6979 individuals from 11 families and 56 species were censused along Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia. Juvenile fishes exhibited divergence in habitat use and specialization among species and at all study scales. Despite the close proximity of coral reef and algal meadows (10's of metres) 25 species were unique to coral reef habitats, and seven to algal meadows. Of the seven unique to algal meadows, several species are known to occupy coral reef habitat as adults, suggesting possible ontogenetic shifts in habitat use. Selectivity between live and dead coral was found to be species-specific. In particular, juvenile scarids were found predominantly on the skeletons of dead coral whereas many damsel and butterfly fishes were closely associated with live coral habitat. Among the coral dependent species, coral morphology played a key role in juvenile distribution. Corymbose corals supported a disproportionate number of coral species and individuals relative to their availability, whereas less complex shapes (i.e. massive & encrusting) were rarely used by juvenile fish. Habitat specialisation by juvenile species of ecological and fisheries importance, for a variety of habitat types, argues strongly for the careful conservation and management of multiple habitat types within marine parks, and indicates that the current emphasis on planning conservation using representative habitat areas is warranted. Furthermore, the close association of many juvenile fish with corals susceptible to climate change related disturbances suggests that identifying and protecting reefs resilient to this should be a conservation priority.","[Wilson, Shaun K.; Holmes, Thomas H.] Marine Sci Program, Dept Environm & Conservat, Div Sci, Kensington, WA, Australia; [Depczynski, Martial; Fisher, Rebecca; O'Leary, Rebecca A.; Tinkler, Paul] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Inst, Australian Inst Marine Sci, Crawley, WA, Australia",56,10.1371/journal.pone.0015185,2010

Group territories overlapped and, in many cases, the same sleeping burrows were used by different groups.

Analysis of variance of lidar topography confirmed the presence of three distinct terraces on all three major DTCRE banks (Loggerhead Bank, Garden Bank, and Pulaski Bank). Reef building on the middle terrace (T2) began atop Pleistocene edifices on Loggerhead Bank by 8.0 ka (thousands of years ago) and on Garden Bank by 7.2 ka at elevations of about -16.0 m and -11.9 m, respectively, relative to present mean sea level. Following this initiation at different elevations, T2 aggraded vertically on both banks at different rates during the early Holocene under foundering conditions until a highstand at 5.2 ka, resulting in a 2.21 m offset in present mean T2 elevation between these banks. Initiation of an upper terrace (T1) occurred on both Loggerhead Bank and Garden Bank in association with sea-level fall to a lowstand at near 4.8 ka. This upper terrace initiated on Garden Bank at about 5.0 ka and then grew upward at rate of 2.5 mm year(-1) until approximately 3.8 ka(.) On Loggerhead Bank, the upper T1 terrace formed after 4.5 ka at a higher vertical aggradation rate of 4.1 mm year(-1), but at a lower elevation than on Garden Bank. Terrace T1 aggraded on Loggerhead Bank below the elevation of lowstands during late Holocene sea-level oscillation, and consequently erosion on Loggerhead Bank was minimal and likely limited to the crest of the upper terrace. In contrast, after 3.8 ka terrace T1 on Garden Bank likely tracked sea level and consequently underwent erosion when sea level fell to second, third and fourth lowstands at 3.3, 1.1, and 0.3 ka.","[Brock, J.

Recruitment occurred throughout the year. Most of the abundant species exhibited protracted recruitment seasons. This confirms the expectation of extended breeding of reef fishes at lower latitudes. The annual pattern of recruitment of reef fishes as a group was predictable. Annual fluctuations of sea surface temperature and wind strength largely explained the pattern. Rainfall, however, did not significantly influence the pattern of recruitment. Peaks in density and species richness of recruits occurred during the southwest monsoon and the second inter-monsoonal period of the year (July to October) when temperatures were highest and when most of the sites were sheltered from winds or when winds were weak. Conversely, lowest density and species richness were observed during the northeast monsoon (November to March) when temperatures were lowest and most sites were exposed to winds. The same pattern could also be seen in the recruitment of both damselfishes (Pomacentridae) and wrasses (Labridae), notwithstanding a tenfold difference in abundance of recruits between the two families. The pattern was fairly consistent across most sites, among most of the species that were examined, and between the 2 years that were sampled.

The development of effective conservation measures depends on understanding the causes of such phase shifts. The prevailing view that coral-macroalgal phase shifts commonly occur due to insufficient grazing by fishes is based on correlation with overfishing and inferences from models and small-scale experiments rather than on long-term quantitative field studies of fish communities at affected and resilient sites. Consequently, the specific characteristics of herbivorous fish communities that most promote reef resilience under natural conditions are not known, though this information is critical for identifying vulnerable ecosystems. In this study, 11 years of field surveys recorded the development of the most persistent coral-macroalgal phase shift (> 7 years) yet observed on Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR). This shift followed extensive coral mortality caused by thermal stress (coral bleaching) and damaging storms. Comparisons with two similar reefs that suffered similar disturbances but recovered relatively rapidly demonstrated that the phase shift occurred despite high abundances of one herbivore functional group (scraping/excavating parrotfishes: Labridae). However, the shift was strongly associated with low fish herbivore diversity and low abundances of algal browsers (predominantly Siganidae) and grazers/detritivores (Acanthuridae), suggesting that one or more of these factors underpin reef resilience and so deserve particular protection. Herbivorous fishes are not harvested on the GBR, and the phase shift was not enhanced by unusually high nutrient levels. This shows that unexploited populations of herbivorous fishes cannot ensure reef resilience even under benign conditions and suggests that reefs could lose resilience under relatively low fishing pressure. Predictions of more severe and widespread coral mortality due to global climate change emphasize the need for more effective identification and protection of ecosystem components that are critical for the prevention of coral reef phase shifts.","[Cheal, A.

The species is a typical accessory component in coral reefs, can reach sizes of tens of centimetres, and dates back to the Late Pleistocene. Here, a 70.2-mm-long oxygen and carbon isotope transect through the shell of a specimen collected at Safaga Bay, northern Red Sea, in May 1996, is presented. The transect runs perpendicularly to the foliate and vesicular layers of the inner ostracum near the ligament area of the oyster. The measured delta O-18 and delta C-13 records show sinusoidal fluctuations, which are independent of shell microstructure. The delta C-13 fluctuations exhibit the same wavelength as the delta O-18 fluctuations but are phase shifted. The delta O-18 record reflects the sea surface temperature variations from 1957 until 1996, possibly additionally influenced by the local evaporation. Due to locally enhanced evaporation in the semi-enclosed Safaga Bay, the delta O-18(seawater) value is estimated at 2.17aEuro degrees, i.e., 0.3-0.8aEuro degrees higher than published open surface water delta O-18 values (1.36-1.85aEuro degrees) from the region. The mean water temperature deviates by only 0.4A degrees C from the expected value, and the minimum and maximum values are 0.5A degrees C lower and 2.9A degrees C higher, respectively. When comparing the mean monthly values, however, the sea surface temperature discrepancy between reconstructed and global grid datasets is always < 1.0A degrees C. The delta C-13 signal is weakly negatively correlated with regional chlorophyll a concentration and with the sunshine duration, which may reflect changes in the bivalve's respiration. The study emphasises the palaeogeographic context in isotope studies based on fossils, because coastal embayments might not reflect open-water oceanographic conditions.","[Titschack, J.] Univ Bremen, Ctr Marine Environm Sci, MARUM, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Titschack, J.] Abt Meeresforsch, D-26382 Wilhelmshaven, Germany; [Zuschin, M.; Baal, C.] Univ Vienna, Dept Palaeontol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Spoetl, C.] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Geol & Palaeontol, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria",17,10.1007/s00338-010-0665-7,2010

However, the relative importance of these factors and whether or not behavioural interactions reinforce or disrupt habitat associations are poorly understood. This paper explores the degree to which habitat and social preferences explain the association that three common coral reef cardinalfish species (Zoramia leptacanthus, Archamia zosterophora and Cheilodipterus quinquelineatus; family Apogonidae) have with coral substrata at Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef. At diurnal resting sites, species were strongly associated with branching corals, with 80-90% of each species inhabiting one branching coral species, Porites cylindrica. Species were also highly gregarious, forming large con-specific and hetero-specific aggregations in coral heads, potentially reinforcing habitat associations. Three-way choice experiments were conducted to test fishes habitat preferences for living coral over dead substrata, for particular coral species, and the influence of gregarious behaviour on these habitat choices. The strength of habitat preferences differed among species, with Z. leptacanthus preferring live coral and P. cylindrica, A. zosterophora preferring P. cylindrica, whether live or dead and C. quinquelineatus exhibiting no preferences. All species were attracted to conspecifics, and for C. quinquelineatus and A. zosterophora, conspecific attraction resulted in stronger preferences for live corals. Gregarious behaviour also increased C. quinquelineatus associations with P. cylindrica. The relative strength of social attraction versus habitat preferences was investigated by comparing fish habitat preferences in the presence and/or absence of conspecifics. The presence of conspecifics on non-preferred rubble habitat reduced each species association with live coral. This study's results indicate that in the field, habitat preferences and conspecific attraction combine to reinforce the association between cardinalfishes and a narrow range of coral substrata.","[Gardiner, N.

This paper presents the first quantitative study of CCA disease on U.S. Pacific coral reefs, based on Rapid Ecological Assessments conducted at 337 discrete sites, at 42 different U.S.-Affiliated Pacific Islands and Atolls, within 5 major geographical regions: main Hawaiian Islands, Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, American Samoa, the Pacific Remote Island Areas (PRIA), and Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). Five major disease categories were enumerated, and a disease occurrence index was estimated, based on case counts relative to percent CCA cover. CCA disease occurrence exhibited considerable spatial variability both between and within islands/atolls, with some regions being disproportionately affected by disease. No diseases were observed at remote Johnston and Wake Atolls, or the main Hawaiian Islands. Diseases were rare in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands; occasional to common around the PRIA, and common to abundant in American Samoa, Guam, and the Southern Mariana Islands. Pacific-wide, disease occurrence was statistically associated with CCA percent cover and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) but not with human population density; nonetheless, disease occurrence and population density were statistically correlated for those islands containing disease. Although Pacific-wide, the occurrence of disease was low, with no active outbreaks detected in any region, hot spots of disease were detected around Guam, the southern CNMI, American Samoa, and the PRIA. The high levels of spatial and temporal variability in disease occurrence herein underscore the patchy nature and fluctuating distribution dynamics of these afflictions. Also, the widespread dispersal capabilities and extraordinary infective properties of some of these pathogens highlight the importance of better understanding CCA disease dynamics and discerning the relative threat levels on coral reef ecosystems.","Univ Hawaii, Joint Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm,Coral Reef Ecosyst Div, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv,Pacif Isl Fisheries Sc, Honolulu, HI 96814 USA",17,10.1007/s00338-010-0646-x,2010

One hundred and seventy-eight nominal species from 12 different phyla were extracted across 50 replicate colonies of each coral host. A single coral colony, approximately 20 cm in diameter, harbored as many as 73 individuals and 24 species. There were substantial differences in invertebrate species composition among coral hosts of different families as well as genera. Twenty-seven species (15% of all taxa collected) were found on only one of the four different coral species, which may potentially indicate some level of specialization among coral hosts. The distinct assemblages on different coral species, and the presence of potential specialists, suggests invertebrate communities will be sensitive to the differential loss of branching coral species resulting from coral reef degradation.","[Stella, J.

Available in situ measurements and model data are used to validate the satellite observations and to specify the nature of the processes occurring within the water column itself. The characteristic features are identified and physical theory employed to develop an understanding of associated processes. In particular, the effect of the eddy in raising cooler, nutrient-enriched oceanic subsurface water and transporting it to the reef zone, and eventually into the lagoon, is shown. This study demonstrates that the linkages between large-scale oceanography and the meso- and sub-mesoscale patterns are crucial to determining biologic responses on the scale of reef communities and may be key to understanding climate change impacts at the relevant spatial scales.","[Weeks, S.

We examined how the benthic environment structures marine fish assemblages using high-resolution bathymetry and accurate predicted benthic habitat maps. Areas characterised by a mosaic of habitat patches supported the highest richness of demersal fishes. A total of 37.4% of the variation in the distribution of the fish assemblage was attributed to 6 significant variables. Depth explained 23.0% of the variation, with the boulders explaining 12.6% and relief 1.4%. The remaining measures (seawhips, light/exposure and solid reef) provided a small (< 1.0%) but significant contribution.

To empirically measure the short-term effects of removing large animals from an ocean ecosystem, we used exclosures to remove large fish from a near-pristine coral reef at Palmyra Atoll, Central Pacific Ocean. We identified a range of effects that followed from the removal of these large fish. These effects were revealed within weeks of their removal. Removing large fish (1) altered the behavior of prey fish; (2) reduced rates of herbivory on certain species of reef algae; (3) had both direct positive (reduced mortality of coral recruits) and indirect negative (through reduced grazing pressure on competitive algae) impacts on recruiting corals; and (4) tended to decrease abundances of small mobile benthic invertebrates.

In 2005, high ocean temperatures in the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean resulted in the most severe bleaching event ever recorded in the basin. Methodology/Principal Findings: Satellite-based tools provided warnings for coral reef managers and scientists, guiding both the timing and location of researchers' field observations as anomalously warm conditions developed and spread across the greater Caribbean region from June to October 2005. Field surveys of bleaching and mortality exceeded prior efforts in detail and extent, and provided a new standard for documenting the effects of bleaching and for testing nowcast and forecast products. Collaborators from 22 countries undertook the most comprehensive documentation of basin-scale bleaching to date and found that over 80% of corals bleached and over 40% died at many sites. The most severe bleaching coincided with waters nearest a western Atlantic warm pool that was centered off the northern end of the Lesser Antilles. Conclusions/Significance: Thermal stress during the 2005 event exceeded any observed from the Caribbean in the prior 20 years, and regionally-averaged temperatures were the warmest in over 150 years. Comparison of satellite data against field surveys demonstrated a significant predictive relationship between accumulated heat stress (measured using NOAA Coral Reef Watch's Degree Heating Weeks) and bleaching intensity. This severe, widespread bleaching and mortality will undoubtedly have long-term consequences for reef ecosystems and suggests a troubled future for tropical marine ecosystems under a warming climate.","[Eakin, C.

Methodology/Principal Findings: This study quantifies the influence of herbivory and water quality upon coral reef assemblages through space and time in Tutuila, American Samoa, a Pacific high island. Widespread declines in dominant corals (Acropora and Montipora) resulted from cyclone Heta at the end of 2003, shortly after the study began. Four sites that initially had similar coral reef assemblages but differential temporal dynamics four years following the disturbance event were classified by standardized measures of 'recovery status', defined by rates of change in ecological measures that are known to be sensitive to localized stressors. Status was best predicted, interactively, by water quality and herbivory. Expanding upon temporal trends, this study examined if similar dependencies existed through space; building multiple regression models to identify linkages between similar status measures and local stressors for 17 localities around Tutuila. The results highlighted consistent, interactive interdependencies for coral reef assemblages residing upon two unique geological reef types. Finally, the predictive regression models produced at the island scale were graphically interpreted with respect to hypothesized site-specific recovery thresholds. Conclusions/Significance: Cumulatively, our study purports that moving away from describing relatively well-known patterns behind recovery, and focusing upon understanding causes, improves our foundation to predict future ecological dynamics, and thus improves coral reef management.","[Houk, Peter; Musburger, Craig] Pacific Marine Resources Inst, Saipan, CM USA; [Musburger, Craig] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Zool, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Wiles, Phil] Amer Samoa Environm Protect Agcy, Pago Pago, AS USA",10,10.1371/journal.pone.0013913,2010

Seagrass bed loss had a significant negative influence on not only seagrass bed residents but also commercially important coral reef fishes that utilize seagrass beds as nurseries or feeding grounds. With seagrass bed loss, mean species' richness and densities of overall seagrass bed fishes per transect decreased by more than 75 and 85%, respectively. Most of the affected fishes were benthivores, piscivores, detritivores, and herbivores. Of 21 dominant species, 13 disappeared completely and 4 showed severe reductions in densities following seagrass bed loss, whereas the densities of 4 bottom-dwelling gobies did not change significantly. Thus, this study demonstrated that most seagrass bed fishes lack the ability to adapt to seagrass habitat loss, suggesting that increasing global seagrass loss will cause serious reductions in seagrass-associated fishes and fishery resources.","Kochi Univ, Grad Sch Kuroshio Sci, Nanko Ku, Kochi 7838502, Japan",6,10.1007/s00227-010-1504-7,2010

Here, we investigate the intra-phyletic spatial associations between the 20 most abundant sponge species at two sites experiencing different environmental regimes in the Wakatobi National Marine Park, Indonesia. We used a Monte Carlo simulation approach to compare the number of spatial associations between each species pair to that expected if species distribution patterns were non-associative (i.e. random). We found that sponges were predominately randomly distributed at the high coral cover site, whereas most sponges were negatively associated with other sponges at the sedimented, low coral cover site. We also found differences between distribution patterns for specific species at the two sites; a number of species that showed a random distribution pattern at the high coral cover site had negative association patterns at the low coral cover site. Our research supports recent ecological studies suggesting that interactions between species are unlikely to be homogenously distributed, as we found that some sponge species interactions differed depending on the environmental regimes in which they were found; this suggests that species interactions may be spatially variable. Finally, our results contrast with studies from elsewhere, as the sponge assemblages at these two sites in the Wakatobi appear to be dominated by negative associations and random distribution patterns rather than widespread competition.","[Bell, James J.; Berman, Jade; Jones, Timothy] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Marine Environm & Econ Res, Wellington, New Zealand; [Hepburn, Leanne J.] Univ Essex, Dept Biol Sci, Coral Reef Res Unit, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",3,10.1007/s00227-010-1514-5,2010

The natural delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures of coral mucus differed significantly from seawater POM for the majority of seasonal comparisons, but were inappropriate for explicit tracing of mucus in the coral reef food web. Thus, a labeling technique using stable isotope tracers (C-13 and N-15) was developed that produced delta C-13 values of up to 122 +/- A 5aEuro degrees (mean +/- A SE) and delta N-15 of up to 2,100 +/- A 151aEuro degrees in mucus exuded by Fungia corals. C-13 and N-15-enriched compounds were rapidly (within 3 h) and light-dependently transferred from the endosymbiotic zooxanthellae to the mucus-producing coral host. The traceability of N-15-labeled mucus was examined by evaluating its uptake and potential utilization by epizoic acoelomorph Waminoa worms naturally occurring on a range of scleractinian coral taxa. This tracer experiment resulted in uptake of coral mucus by the coral-associated acoelomorphs and further demonstrated the possibility to trace stable isotope-labeled coral mucus by revealing a new trophic pathway in coral reef ecosystems.","[Naumann, Malik S.; Wild, Christian] Univ Munich, Coral Reef Ecol Work Grp CORE, GeoBio Ctr, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Naumann, Malik S.; Mayr, Christoph; Wild, Christian] Univ Munich, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Struck, Ulrich] Humboldt Univ, Museum Nat Kunde, D-10115 Berlin, Germany",24,10.1007/s00227-010-1516-3,2010

The overall objective of this study was to identify socio-economic indicators and drivers to improve the understanding of the dynamics between socio-economic conditions and current exploitation levels of finfish and invertebrates of coastal communities in 17 Pacific Island countries and territories. We showed that exploitation rates and thus possible overexploitation are not solely the consequence of a simple demographic growth process but are in fact a result of the choices people have. Our results confirmed a close relationship between resource exploitation rates and economic development at the national level and the availability of alternative income opportunities at the community level. Multivariate analysis results suggest that communities in countries with somewhat unfavourable conditions and limited access to alternatives and fishing households in communities with overall favourable economic conditions are at highest vulnerability as they have the highest dependence on coastal fisheries resources. Alternative economic opportunities at the national scale and availability of alternative income at the community level vary significantly between cultural groups. Based on our results, the development of management strategies with realistic expectations of ensuring livelihood of coastal communities and sustainable resource use in Pacific Island countries and territories requires a hierarchical and integral approach. Major drivers identified at the regional, cultural and local levels should be used to identify priorities, to assess overall advantages and limitations at the different levels as well as the vulnerability of communities targeted, and to develop strategies accordingly.

Diet-tissue discrimination factors determined from paired tissue and gut samples taken from 152 individuals from 26 fish species at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia demonstrate a large amount of variability around constant values. While caution is necessary in using gut contents to represent diet due to the potential for high temporal variability, there were significant effects of trophic position and season that may also lead to variability in Delta N under natural conditions. Nitrogen enrichment increased significantly at higher trophic levels (higher tissue delta(15)N), with significantly higher Delta N in carnivorous species. Changes in diet led to significant changes in Delta N, but not tissue delta(15)N, between seasons for several species: Acanthurus triostegus, Chromis viridis, Parupeneus signatus and Pomacentrus moluccensis. These results confirm that the use of meta-analysis averages for Delta N is likely to be inappropriate for accurately determining diets and trophic relationships using tissue stable isotope ratios. Where feasible, discrimination factors should be directly quantified for each species and trophic link in question, acknowledging the potential for significant variation away from meta-analysis averages and, perhaps, controlled laboratory diets and conditions.","[Wyatt, Alex S.

This study investigates how the ecological performance of 56 marine reserves throughout the Philippines, Caribbean, and Western Indian Ocean (WIO) is related to both reserve design features and the socioeconomic characteristics in associated coastal communities. Ecological performance was measured as fish biomass in the reserve relative to nearby areas. Of the socioeconomic variables considered, human population density and compliance with reserve rules had the strongest effects on fish biomass, but the effects of these variables were region specific. Relationships between population density and the reserve effect on fish biomass were negative in the Caribbean, positive in the WIO, and not detectable in the Philippines. Differing associations between population density and reserve effectiveness defy simple explanation but may depend on human migration to effective reserves, depletion of fish stocks outside reserves, or other social factors that change with population density. Higher levels of compliance reported by resource users was related to higher fish biomass in reserves compared with outside, but this relationship was only statistically significant in the Caribbean. A heuristic model based on correlations between social, cultural, political, economic, and other contextual conditions in 127 marine reserves showed that high levels of compliance with reserve rules were related to complex social interactions rather than simply to enforcement of reserve rules. Comparative research of this type is important for uncovering the complexities surrounding human dimensions of marine reserves and improving reserve management.","[Pollnac, Richard; Dalton, Tracey] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Marine Affairs, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Christie, Patrick] Univ Washington, Sch Marine Affairs, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Christie, Patrick] Univ Washington, Jackson Sch Int Studies, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Cinner, Joshua E.; Graham, Nicholas A.

Local adaptation to thermal gradients could cause populations in different parts of the range to respond differently. In aquatic systems, keeping pace with increased oxygen demand is the key parameter affecting species' response to higher temperatures. Therefore, respiratory performance is expected to vary between populations at different latitudes because they experience different thermal environments. We tested for geographical variation in respiratory performance of tropical marine fishes by comparing thermal effects on resting and maximum rates of oxygen uptake for six species of coral reef fish at two locations on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia. The two locations, Heron Island and Lizard Island, are separated by approximately 1200 km along a latitudinal gradient. We found strong counter-gradient variation in aerobic scope between locations in four species from two families (Pomacentridae and Apogonidae). High-latitude populations (Heron Island, southern GBR) performed significantly better than low-latitude populations (Lizard Island, northern GBR) at temperatures up to 5 degrees C above average summer surface-water temperature. The other two species showed no difference in aerobic scope between locations. Latitudinal variation in aerobic scope was primarily driven by up to 80% higher maximum rates of oxygen uptake in the higher latitude populations. Our findings suggest that compensatory mechanisms in high-latitude populations enhance their performance at extreme temperatures, and consequently, that high-latitude populations of reef fishes will be less impacted by ocean warming than will low latitude populations.","[Gardiner, Naomi M.; Munday, Philip L.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Gardiner, Naomi M.; Munday, Philip L.] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Nilsson, Goran E.] Univ Oslo, Dept Mol Biosci, Physiol Programme, Oslo, Norway",47,10.1371/journal.pone.0013299,2010

This study investigated how such dense macroalgal assemblages change the chemical and physical microenvironment for understorey corals, and how the altered environmental conditions affect the physiological performance of corals. Field measurements were conducted on macroalgal-dominated inshore reefs in the Great Barrier Reef in quadrats with macroalgal biomass ranging from 235 to 1029 g DW m(-2) dry weight. Underneath mat- forming assemblages, the mean concentration of dissolved oxygen was reduced by 26% and irradiance by 96% compared with conditions above the mat, while concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and soluble reactive phosphorous increased by 26% and 267%, respectively. The difference was significant but less pronounced under canopy-forming assemblages. Dissolved oxygen declined and dissolved inorganic carbon and alkalinity increased with increasing algal biomass underneath mat- forming but not under canopy-forming assemblages. The responses of corals to conditions similar to those found underneath algal assemblages were investigated in an aquarium experiment. Coral nubbins of the species Acropora millepora showed reduced photosynthetic yields and increased RNA/DNA ratios when exposed to conditions simulating those underneath assemblages (pre-incubating seawater with macroalgae, and shading). The magnitude of these stress responses increased with increasing proportion of pre-incubated algal water. Our study shows that mat- forming and, to a lesser extent, canopy-forming macroalgal assemblages alter the physical and chemical microenvironment sufficiently to directly and detrimentally affect the metabolism of corals, potentially impeding reef recovery from algal to coral-dominated states after disturbance. Macroalgal dominance on coral reefs therefore simultaneously represents a consequence and cause of coral reef degradation.","[Hauri, Claudine] ETH, Inst Biogeochem & Pollutant Dynam, Zurich, Switzerland; [Hauri, Claudine; Fabricius, Katharina E.; Schaffelke, Britta; Humphrey, Craig] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia",23,10.1371/journal.pone.0012685,2010

While reductions in species diversity and abundance of fish communities have been documented following coral bleaching, the mechanisms that underlie these changes are poorly understood. The present study examined the impacts of coral bleaching on the early life-history processes of coral reef fishes. Daily monitoring of fish settlement patterns found that ten times as many fish settled to healthy coral than sub-lethally bleached coral. Species diversity of settling fishes was least on bleached coral and greatest on dead coral, with healthy coral having intermediate levels of diversity. Laboratory experiments using light-trap caught juveniles showed that different damselfish species chose among healthy, bleached and dead coral habitats using different combinations of visual and olfactory cues. The live coral specialist, Pomacentrus moluccensis, preferred live coral and avoided bleached and dead coral, using mostly visual cues to inform their habitat choice. The habitat generalist, Pomacentrus amboinensis, also preferred live coral and avoided bleached and dead coral but selected these habitats using both visual and olfactory cues. Trials with another habitat generalist, Dischistodus sp., suggested that vision played a significant role. A 20 days field experiment that manipulated densities of P. moluccensis on healthy and bleached coral heads found an influence of fish density on juvenile weight and growth, but no significant influence of habitat quality. These results suggests that coral bleaching will affect settlement patterns and species distributions by influencing the visual and olfactory cues that reef fish larvae use to make settlement choices. Furthermore, increased fish density within the remaining healthy coral habitats could play an important role in influencing population dynamics.","[McCormick, M. I.; Moore, J. A. Y.; Munday, P.

Assignment methods and gene flow estimates indicate that the recolonization of Krakatau occurred mainly from the closest upstream reef system, Pulau Seribu, but that larval input from other regions has also occurred. This pattern is clearer in S. hystrix, which is traditionally the more dispersal-limited species. Despite these observed patterns of larval dispersal, self-recruitment appears to now be the most important factor in supplying larvae to coral populations in Krakatau. This suggests that the colonization of devastated reefs can occur quickly through larval dispersal; however, their survival requires local sources of larvae for self-recruitment. This research supports the observation that the recovery of genetic diversity in coral reef animals can occur on the order of decades and centuries rather than millennia. Conservation measures aimed at sustaining coral reef populations in Krakatau and elsewhere should include both the protection of upstream source populations for larval replenishment should disaster occur as well as the protection of large adult colonies to serve as local larval sources.","[Starger, C.

In addition, the influence of environmental factors (water temperature, light availability and ambient inorganic nutrient concentrations) was evaluated. Particulate organic carbon (POC) and particulate nitrogen (PN) release were always detectable and genus-specific, with Stylophora releasing most POM (6.5 mg POC and 0.5 mg PN m(-2) coral surface area h(-1)) during all seasons. The fire coral Millepora released significantly less POM (0.3 mg POC and 0.04 mg PN m(-2) coral surface area h(-1)) than all investigated anthozoan genera. The average POC:PN ratio of POM released by all coral genera was 12 +/- A 1, indicating high carbon/low nitrogen content of coral-derived organic matter. POM release showed little seasonal variation, but average values of POC and PN release rates correlated with water temperature, light availability and ambient nitrate concentrations. DOC net release and elevated DOC:POC ratios were detectable for Acropora, Goniastrea and Millepora, revealing maximum values for Acropora (30.7 mg DOC m(-2) coral surface area h(-1)), whilst predominant DOC uptake was observed for Pocillopora, Fungia and Stylophora.

The release rate of DON per unit coral surface area significantly decreased after the nutrient enrichment, while the release rate of DOC was constant. Because the chlorophyll a (chl a) content of zooxanthellae per unit surface area increased, the release rate of DOC significantly decreased when normalized to unit chl a. These results suggested that the incorporation of NO3 (-) and PO4 (3-) stimulated the synthesis of new cellular components in the coral colonies and consequently, reduced extracellular release of DOC and DON. Actually, significant increase in N and P contents relative to C content was observed in the coral's tissue after the nutrient enrichment. The present study has concluded that inorganic nutrient enrichment not only affects coral-algal metabolism inside the colony but also affects a microbial community around the coral because the organic matter released from corals functions as energy carrier in the coral reef ecosystem.","[Tanaka, Y.; Ogawa, H.; Miyajima, T.] Univ Tokyo, Marine Biogeochem Lab, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Chiba 2778564, Japan",18,10.1007/s00338-010-0639-9,2010

Middle Reef has a high mean hard coral cover (> 39%), relatively low mean macro-algal cover (< 15%) and a coral community comprising at least 81 hard coral species. Cluster analysis differentiated six benthic communities which were mapped onto the geomorphological structure of the reef to reveal a spatially patchy community mosaic that reflects hydrodynamic and sediment redistribution processes. Coral cover data collected annually from windward slope transects since 1993 show that coral cover has increased over the last similar to 15 years despite a history of episodic mortality events.

Spatial autocorrelation in the structure of butterflyfish communities versus key differences in reef habitats was investigated to assess the extent to which the structure of these fish communities is influenced by habitat conditions. Benthic communities on each of the 47 reefs were broadly categorised as either: 1. Poritidae/Alcyoniidae, 2. mixed taxa, 3. soft coral or 4. Acropora-dominated habitats. These habitat types most reflected increases in water clarity and wave exposure, moving across the GBR shelf from coastal to outer-shelf environments. In turn, each habitat type also supported very distinct butterflyfish communities. Hard coral feeders were always the dominant butterflyfish species in each community type.

Coral growth rates have declined over the past 30 years in the western Pacific, Indian, and North Atlantic Oceans. The spatial scale of this decline has led researchers to suggest that a global phenomenon like ocean acidification may be responsible. A multi-species inventory of coral growth from Pacific Panama confirms that declines have occurred in some, but not all species. Linear extension declined significantly in the most important reef builder of the eastern tropical Pacific, Pocillopora damicornis, by nearly one-third from 1974 to 2006. The rate of decline in skeletal extension for P. damicornis from Pacific Panama (0.9% year(-1)) was nearly identical to massive Porites in the Indo-Pacific over the past 20-30 years (0.89-1.23% year(-1)). The branching pocilloporid corals have shown an increased tolerance to recurrent thermal stress events in Panama, but appear to be susceptible to acidification. In contrast, the massive pavonid corals have shown less tolerance to thermal stress, but may be less sensitive to acidification. These differing sensitivities will be a fundamental determinant of eastern tropical Pacific coral reef community structure with accelerating climate change that has implications for the future of reef communities worldwide.","UM CIMAS, NOAA AOML OCD, Miami, FL 33149 USA",84,10.1007/s00338-010-0623-4,2010

Associations with multicellular eukaryotes such as polychaete worms, bivalves and sponges are not generally considered to be symbiotic as the host responds to their presence by forming physical barriers with an active growth edge in the exoskeleton isolating the invader and, at a subcellular level, activating innate immune responses such as melanin deposition. This study describes a novel symbiosis between a newly described hydrozoan (Zanclea margaritae sp. nov.) and the reef building coral Acropora muricata (=A. formosa), with the hydrozoan hydrorhiza ramifying throughout the coral tissues with no evidence of isolation or activation of the immune systems of the host. The hydrorhiza lacks a perisarc, which is typical of symbiotic species of this and related genera, including species that associate with other cnidarians such as octocorals. The symbiosis was observed at all sites investigated from two distant locations on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, and appears to be host species specific, being found only in A. muricata and in none of 30 other species investigated at these sites. Not all colonies of A. muricata host the hydrozoans and both the prevalence within the coral population (mean = 66%) and density of emergent hydrozoan hydranths on the surface of the coral (mean = 4.3 cm(-2), but up to 52 cm(-2)) vary between sites. The form of the symbiosis in terms of the mutualism-parasitism continuum is not known, although the hydrozoan possesses large stenotele nematocysts, which may be important for defence from predators and protozoan pathogens. This finding expands the known A. muricata holobiont and the association must be taken into account in future when determining the corals' abilities to defend against predators and withstand stress.","[Pantos, O.] Univ Queensland, Global Change Inst, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Bythell, J.

Here, body size-related changes in muscle delta N-15 and delta C-13 of four coral reef fishes, Acanthurus nigrofuscus (herbivore), Chaetodon lunulatus (corallivore), Chromis xanthura (planktivore) and Plectropomus leopardus (piscivore) were investigated at two locations in the Solomon Islands. All four species occupied distinct isotopic niches and the concurrent delta C-13' values of C. xanthura and P. leopardus suggested a common planktonic production source. Size-related shifts in delta N-15, and thus trophic level, were observed in C. xanthura, C. lunulatus and P. leopardus, and these trends varied between location, indicating spatial differences in trophic ecology. A literature review of tropical fishes revealed that positive delta N-15-size trends are common while negative delta N-15-size trends are rare. Size-delta N-15 trends fall into approximately equal groups representing size-based feeding within a food chain, and that associated with a basal resource shift and occurs in conjunction with changes in production source, indicated by delta C-13. The review also revealed large scale differences in isotope-size trends and this, combined with small scale location differences noted earlier, highlights a high degree of plasticity in the reef fishes studied. This suggests that trophic size analysis of reef fishes would provide a productive avenue to identify species potentially vulnerable to reef impacts as a result of constrained trophic behaviour.","[Greenwood, N.

One proposed solution to this problem is ecosystem-based marine spatial planning (MSP), which is a process that informs the spatial distribution of activities in the ocean so that existing and emerging uses can be maintained, use conflicts reduced, and ecosystem health and services protected and sustained for future generations. Because a key goal of ecosystem-based MSP is to maintain the delivery of ecosystem services that humans want and need, it must be based on ecological principles that articulate the scientifically recognized attributes of healthy, functioning ecosystems. These principles should be incorporated into a decision-making framework with clearly defined targets for these ecological attributes. This paper identifies ecological principles for MSP based on a synthesis of previously suggested and/or operationalized principles, along with recommendations generated by a group of twenty ecologists and marine scientists with diverse backgrounds and perspectives on MSP. The proposed four main ecological principles to guide MSP maintaining or restoring: native species diversity, habitat diversity and heterogeneity, key species, and connectivity and two additional guidelines, the need to account for context and uncertainty, must be explicitly taken into account in the planning process. When applied in concert with social, economic, and governance principles, these ecological principles can inform the designation and siting of ocean uses and the management of activities in the ocean to maintain or restore healthy ecosystems, allow delivery of marine ecosystem services, and ensure sustainable economic and social benefits.

Most conservation efforts occur at local scales and, when effective, can increase the resilience of coral reefs to global threats such as climate change (e.g. warming water and ocean acidification). Limited resources for conservation require that we efficiently prioritize where and how to best sustain coral reef ecosystems. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we develop the first prioritization approach that can guide regional-scale conservation investments in land-and sea-based conservation actions that cost-effectively mitigate threats to coral reefs, and apply it to the Coral Triangle, an area of significant global attention and funding. Using information on threats to marine ecosystems, effectiveness of management actions at abating threats, and the management and opportunity costs of actions, we calculate the rate of return on investment in two conservation actions in sixteen ecoregions. We discover that marine conservation almost always trumps terrestrial conservation within any ecoregion, but terrestrial conservation in one ecoregion can be a better investment than marine conservation in another. We show how these results could be used to allocate a limited budget for conservation and compare them to priorities based on individual criteria. Conclusions/Significance: Previous prioritization approaches do not consider both land and sea-based threats or the socioeconomic costs of conserving coral reefs. A simple and transparent approach like ours is essential to support effective coral reef conservation decisions in a large and diverse region like the Coral Triangle, but can be applied at any scale and to other marine ecosystems.","[Klein, Carissa J.; Beger, Maria; Grantham, Hedley S.; Treml, Eric; Wilson, Kerrie; Possingham, Hugh P.] Univ Queensland, Ctr Ecol, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Ban, Natalie C.] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Halpern, Benjamin S.] Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA USA; [Game, Edward T.; Green, Alison] Nature Conservancy, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Klein, Travis J.] Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Kininmonth, Stuart] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia",39,10.1371/journal.pone.0012431,2010

Here, we demonstrate how seascape heterogeneity, defined as the spatial configuration and composition of coral reef habitats, can mask our ability to discern reserve effects. We then test the application of a landscape approach, utilizing advances in benthic habitat mapping and GIS techniques, to quantify this heterogeneity and alleviate the confounding influence during reserve assessment. Seascape metrics were quantified at multiple spatial scales using a combination of spatial image analysis and in situ surveys at 87 patch reef sites in Glover's Reef Lagoon, Belize, within and outside a marine reserve enforced since 1998. Patch reef sites were then clustered into classes sharing similar seascape attributes using metrics that correlated significantly to observed variations in both fish and coral communities. When the efficacy of the marine reserve was assessed without including landscape attributes, no reserve effects were detected in the diversity and abundance of fish and coral communities, despite 10 years of management protection. However, grouping sites based on landscape attributes revealed significant reserve effects between site classes. Fish had higher total biomass (1.5x) and commercially important biomass (1.75x) inside the reserve and coral cover was 1.8 times greater inside the reserve, though direction and degree of response varied by seascape class. Our findings show that the application of a landscape classification approach vastly improves our ability to evaluate the efficacy of marine reserves by controlling for confounding effects of seascape heterogeneity and suggests that landscape heterogeneity should be considered in future reserve design.","[Huntington, Brittany E.; Karnauskas, Mandy; Babcock, Elizabeth A.; Lirman, Diego] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA",29,10.1371/journal.pone.0012327,2010

Thermal stress from rising temperatures has been implicated as a causal factor in disease outbreaks observed on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, and elsewhere in the world. Here, we examine seasonal effects of satellite-derived temperature on the abundance of coral diseases known as white syndromes on the Great Barrier Reef, considering both warm stress during summer and deviations from mean temperatures during the preceding winter. We found a high correlation (r(2) = 0.953) between summer warm thermal anomalies (Hot Snap) and disease abundance during outbreak events. Inclusion of thermal conditions during the preceding winter revealed that a significant reduction in disease outbreaks occurred following especially cold winters (Cold Snap), potentially related to a reduction in pathogen loading. Furthermore, mild winters (i.e., neither excessively cool nor warm) frequently preceded disease outbreaks. In contrast, disease outbreaks did not typically occur following warm winters, potentially because of increased disease resistance of the coral host. Understanding the balance between the effects of warm and cold winters on disease outbreak will be important in a warming climate. Combining the influence of winter and summer thermal effects resulted in an algorithm that yields both a Seasonal Outlook of disease risk at the conclusion of winter and near real-time monitoring of Outbreak Risk during summer. This satellite-derived system can provide coral reef managers with an assessment of risk three-to-six months in advance of the summer season that can then be refined using near-real-time summer observations. This system can enhance the capacity of managers to prepare for and respond to possible disease outbreaks and focus research efforts to increase understanding of environmental impacts on coral disease in this era of rapidly changing climate.","[Heron, Scott F.] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Heron, Scott F.; Skirving, William J.] James Cook Univ, Dept Phys, Sch Engn & Phys Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Heron, Scott F.; Skirving, William J.] James Cook Univ, Marine Geophys Lab, Sch Engn & Phys Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Willis, Bette L.; Page, Cathie A.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Willis, Bette L.; Page, Cathie A.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Eakin, C.

Possible management responses include reef rehabilitation of damaged areas, and/or increased enforcement to protect still-living ones. Here we show that in Komodo National Park, Indonesia, rehabilitation by installing locally-quarried rocks on blasted rubble fields can be relatively low cost (similar to US$4.80 per m(2)) and simple, but it is not economically viable at large scales. Although rehabilitation without enforcement is unlikely to be effective, we compared rehabilitation data (costs and coral growth over 8 years) and enforcement costs to conduct two economic analyses: cost-per-area calculations and a cost-effectiveness model over 7 years, and found that rehabilitation costs similar to 70 and similar to 5-times more, respectively, than marine patrols to enforce blast fishing bans. Hence, we recommend that marine protected area managers prioritize investment in achieving compliance with regulations above investment in rehabilitation to ensure that reefs continue to generate biodiversity and fisheries benefits and tourist revenues.","[Fox, Helen E.] World Wildlife Fund US, Conservat Sci Program, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Haisfield, Kelly M.] Univ Maryland, Grad Program Sustainable Dev & Conservat Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Yen, Sheen] Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Mangubhai, Sangeeta] Nature Conservancy, Indonesia Marine Program, Sanur 80228, Bali, Indonesia; [Mous, Peter J.] People & Nat Consulting Int, Badung 80361, Bali, Indonesia",16,10.1111/j.1755-263X.2010.00104.x,2010

The central population occupied reefs from Western Australia to Tahiti and represented the central Indo-Pacific biogeographic realm. Cocos Keeling was distinct from central and western Indo-Pacific biogeographic realms occupying a position intermediate to these. Peripheral populations (Hawaii, Marquesas) represented the eastern Indo-Pacific biogeographic realm, while Seychelles represented the western Indo-Pacific biogeographic realm.

The present study documents levels of spatial variability in pH among coral reef habitats (9 to 10), among locations separated by 100's km of latitude and between east (Great Barrier Reef, GBR) and west (Ningaloo Reef) coasts of Australia. Differences were found in pH between inshore and offshore waters along Ningaloo Reef (means 8.45, 8.53, respectively). Replicate assessments here ranged from 8.22 to 8.64. On the GBR, the range of values over all habitats and replicates was 0.39 pH units (7.98 to 8.37). There were minor but significant differences of 0.05 pH units between 5 consecutive days for habitats on average. Highest pH was recorded in filamentous algal beds maintained by the damselfish Dischistodus perspicillatus. Lowest pH was found in water extracted from sand-dwelling goby holes. While there were marked changes in pH over a 48-h sampling period among 4 habitats at Lizard Island (GBR), there was little evidence of a diel trend. Understanding how pH varies at scales that are relevant to organisms that live on shallow coral reefs is crucial for the design and interpretation of experiments that test the effects on organisms of the changes in water chemistry predicted to affect oceans in the future.","[Gagliano, Monica] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Evolutionary Biol, Sch Anim Biol, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Gagliano, Monica] Univ Western Australia, CMCA, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [McCormick, Mark I.; Moore, James A.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Depczynski, Martial] Univ Western Australia, Australian Inst Marine Sci, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",40,10.1007/s00227-010-1456-y,2010

Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of protected areas for increasing fish abundance or provided insight into the natural abundance and structure of reef fish communities in remote areas. Recently, high apex predator densities (>100,000 individuals.km(-2)) and biomasses (>4 tonnes.ha(-1)) have been reported for some remote islands suggesting the occurrence of inverted trophic biomass pyramids. However, few studies have critically evaluated the methods used for sampling conspicuous and highly mobile fish such as sharks. Ideally, UVC are done instantaneously, however, researchers often count animals that enter the survey area after the survey has started, thus performing non-instantaneous UVC. Methodology/Principal Findings: We developed a simulation model to evaluate counts obtained by divers deploying non-instantaneous belt-transect and stationary-point-count techniques. We assessed how fish speed and survey procedure (visibility, diver speed, survey time and dimensions) affect observed fish counts. Results indicate that the bias caused by fish speed alone is huge, while survey procedures had varying effects. Because the fastest fishes tend to be the largest, the bias would have significant implications on their biomass contribution. Therefore, caution is needed when describing abundance, biomass, and community structure based on non-instantaneous UVC, especially for highly mobile species such as sharks. Conclusions/Significance: Based on our results, we urge that published literature state explicitly whether instantaneous counts were made and that survey procedures be accounted for when non-instantaneous counts are used. Using published density and biomass values of communities that include sharks we explore the effect of this bias and suggest that further investigation may be needed to determine pristine shark abundances and the existence of inverted biomass pyramids. Because such studies are used to make important management and conservation decisions, incorrect estimates of animal abundance and biomass have serious and significant implications.","[Ward-Paige, Christine; Lotze, Heike K.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Flemming, Joanna Mills] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Halifax, NS, Canada",69,10.1371/journal.pone.0011722,2010

Here we present the results from a social learning experiment on six wild vervet monkey groups, where models were either a dominant female or a dominant male. We presented 'artificial fruit' boxes that had doors on opposite, differently coloured ends for access to food. One option was blocked during the demonstration phase, creating consistent demonstrations of one possible solution. Following demonstrations we found a significantly higher participation rate and same-door manipulation in groups with female models compared to groups with male models. These differences appeared to be owing to selective attention of bystanders to female model behaviour rather than owing to female tolerance. Our results demonstrate the favoured role of dominant females as a source for 'directed' social learning in a species with female philopatry. Our findings imply that migration does not necessarily lead to an exchange of socially acquired information within populations, potentially causing highly localized traditions.","[van de Waal, Erica; Renevey, Nathalie; Favre, Camille Monique; Bshary, Redouan] Univ Neuchatel, Inst Biol, CH-2009 Neuchatel, Switzerland; [van de Waal, Erica; Renevey, Nathalie; Favre, Camille Monique; Bshary, Redouan] UNISA, Appl Behav Ecol & Ecosyst Res Unit, ZA-1710 Florida, South Africa",82,10.1098/rspb.2009.2260,2010

Here, we use a combination of laboratory and field-based experiments to show that levels of dissolved CO2 predicted to occur in the ocean this century alter the behavior of larval fish and dramatically decrease their survival during recruitment to adult populations. Altered behavior of larvae was detected at 700 ppm CO2, with many individuals becoming attracted to the smell of predators. At 850 ppm CO2, the ability to sense predators was completely impaired. Larvae exposed to elevated CO2 were more active and exhibited riskier behavior in natural coral-reef habitat. As a result, they had 5-9 times higher mortality from predation than current-day controls, with mortality increasing with CO2 concentration.

We obtained nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial control region for 117 individuals. Measures of haplotype diversity were relatively high. Pairwise population differentiation (F (ST)) was low, but not always non-significant. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed genetic differentiation between groups, when the data was partitioned into two groups consisting of samples from Mauritius and Tanzania in one group, and samples from Kenya and Seychelles in another group. Direction of gene flow was estimated using a Bayesian approach. Migration was sometimes asymmetric or directional, coinciding with the flow of major oceanic and coastal currents in the region. Mismatch distributions, based on the observed number of differences among haplotype pairs, produced a unimodal distribution, indicative of recent demographic expansion. Phylogenetic analyses revealed three clades without any geographic structure, suggesting recent migration between historically isolated lineages. We reconstructed the historical demography of S. ghobban and examined it in the context of Pleistocene climate stages and changes in relative sea level.

Individual fish were detected inside Kealakekua Bay for up to 612 days but many were detected for much shorter periods (median = 52 days). There were species-specific differences in the scale of movements and habitats used, but most fish utilized between 0.2 and 1.6 km of coastline, and individuals of each species showed some degree of diel habitat shift. A wide variety of reef fishes captured inside the MPA swam back and forth across an MPA boundary intersecting continuous reef (i.e., this boundary was porous to reef fish movements), but only 1 of 11 species tagged crossed a wide sandy channel inside Kealakekua Bay suggesting that this feature may function as a natural barrier to movements. Results indicate relatively small MPAs (< 2 km of coastline) could provide effective, long-term protection for multi-species assemblages of reef fishes provided that boundaries are situated along major habitat breaks (e.g., large sand channels between reefs) that may serve as natural barriers to reef fish movements.

However, the classification of mimicry systems into three established evolutionary mechanisms (protection, reproduction and foraging) can be contentious because multiple benefits may be gained by mimics, causing the evolution of such systems to be driven by more than one selective agent. However, data on such systems are generally speculative or anecdotal. This study provides empirical evidence that dual benefits apply to a coral reef fish mimic in terms of increased access to food (aggressive mimicry) and reduced predation risk (Batesian mimicry). Bicolour fangblennies Plagiotremus laudandus gained access to more reef fish victims, which they attack to feed on fins and scales, when they spent more time associated with their model Meiacanthus atrodorsalis. Furthermore, exact replicas of P. laudandus incurred fewer approaches from potential predators compared with control replicas that varied in resemblance to P. laudandus. Predators with trichromatic visual systems (three distinct spectral sensitivities) could potentially distinguish between replicas based on colour based on theoretical vision models. Therefore, this mimicry system could be best described as Batesian-aggressive mimicry in which mimicry evolution is driven by multiple simultaneous selective pressures.","Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia",18,10.1098/rspb.2009.2218,2010

Two-thirds of the MCD (23.6 km(2)) was found to be dense coral reef (Coral Cover = 24.1%) dominated by the Montastraea annularis species complex. Coral reef ecosystems were topographically complex, but could be classified into distinct habitat types, including high coral banks (35.8% of the MCD) and two large novel coral reef habitat types corresponding to an extremely flat basin (18%) and a highly rugose hillock basin (6.5%), containing thousands of coral knolls (2-10 m high). An extreme disease event with undescribed signs of mortality occurred on 47% of coral reefs and reached a high prevalence in affected areas (42.4% +/- A 6.3 SE, N = 26). The disease was significantly clustered in the basin habitats of the western MCD (global Moran's I = 0.32, P < 0.01). Observations of the spatial pattern suggested that the driver was specific to the basin habitats and may have been caused by a coherent abiotic event.","[Smith, T. B.; Blondeau, J.; Nemeth, R.

Several types of MCEs are found in Hawai'i, each of which dominates a different depth range and is characterized by a unique pattern of coral community structure and colony morphology. Although MCEs are documented near both ends of the archipelago and on many of the islands in between, the maximum depth and prevalence of MCEs in Hawai'i were found to decline with increasing latitude. The Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) had significantly deeper and greater percentages of scleractinian coral, and peaks in cover of both scleractinian corals and macroalgae occurred within depth bins 20 m deeper than in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI). Across the archipelago, as depth increased the combined percentage of living cover of mega benthic taxa declined sharply with increasing depth below 70 m, despite the widespread availability of hard substrate.","[Rooney, J.; Donham, E.; Gove, J.; Vetter, O.] Univ Hawaii, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Joint Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Honolulu, HI 96814 USA; [Rooney, J.; Donham, E.; Gove, J.; Vetter, O.] NOAA, NMFS, Honolulu, HI 96814 USA; [Spalding, H.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Bot, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Parrish, F.; Boland, R.] NOAA, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, NMFS, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Fenner, D.] Dept Marine & Wildlife Resources, Pago Pago, AS 96799 USA; [Montgomery, A.] Dept Land & Nat Resources, Div Aquat Resources, Honolulu, HI 96813 USA",55,10.1007/s00338-010-0596-3,2010

But the extent to which the environment and spatial autocorrelation create beta diversity on deep cold-water coral reefs such as those formed by Lophelia pertusa (Scleractinia) is unknown. The effects of remotely sensed and ground-truthed data were tested on the community composition of sessile suspension-feeding communities from the Mingulay Reef Complex, a landscape of inshore Lophelia reefs off the Scottish west coast. Canonical correspondence analysis determined that a statistically significant proportion (68%) of the variance in community composition could be explained by remotely sensed environmental variables (northerly and easterly aspect, seabed rugosity, depth), ground-truthed environmental variables (species richness and reef macrohabitat) and geospatial location. This variation was further partitioned into fractions explained by pure effects of the environment (51%), spatially structured environmental variables (12%) and spatial autocorrelation (5%). Beta diversity in these communities reflected the effects of both measured and unmeasured and spatially dependent environmental variables that vary across the reef complex, i.e., hydrography.

We examined the interannual variations of key variables describing reef habitats (live hard and soft corals, dead corals in place, coral debris, algae and relative proportion of mechanically vulnerable and resistant live hard corals). The cyclone-induced disturbances of habitats differed according to three reef types: patch reefs, barrier reefs far from passes (more than 3 km from the nearest pass) and barrier reefs near passes (less than 3 km from the nearest pass). Short-term mechanical damage was detected on the three-dimensional structure of reef habitats with a notable shift from a community dominated by mechanically vulnerable corals to one dominated by resistant corals on barrier reefs far from passes. The history of habitats and their pre-disturbance characteristics, in link with local hydrodynamics, was found to influence their short-term susceptibility to extreme events such as cyclones. However, the most significant effects appeared in the midterm (within 2 years after the cyclone) as the cover of live hard corals significantly decreased by approximately 45% between 2002 and 2004 on all reef types. The short- and midterm disturbances of coral reef habitats are discussed with regard to published temporal variations in reef fish assemblages, underlining the delayed effects of this cyclonic event on fish as well as benthic habitats. Coral reef habitats and live corals had shown significant patterns of recovery 4 years after the cyclone, followed by similar recovery in fish community, suggesting good resilience in a face of this major natural disturbance in an area under moderate anthropogenic pressure.","[Guillemot, N.] IRD, UR CoReUs, BP A5, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia; [Guillemot, N.; Le Pape, O.] Univ Europeenne Bretagne, UMR 985, INRA Ecol & Sante Ecosyst, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Guillemot, N.] Koniambo Nickel SAS, Environm Serv, Noumea 98802, New Caledonia; [Chabanet, P.] IRD, UR CoReUs, St Clothilde 97492, Reunion, France",23,10.1007/s00338-010-0587-4,2010

This study investigates the process of herbivory in a marginal coral reef system in the Keppel Islands at the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef. Branching Acropora coral and the brown macroalga Lobophora variegata occupied up to 95% of the reef crest substratum at the three surveyed reefs. Feeding rates of herbivorous fishes and removal rates of Lobophora were directly quantified within areas of branching Acropora and on planar surfaces. Feeding rates by herbivorous fishes were habitat dependent with the highest bite rates being found in planar habitats for both Lobophora and the epilithic algal matrix (EAM) by 1-2 orders of magnitude, respectively. Feeding rates on Lobophora were, however, much lower than rates on the EAM. The low rates of Lobophora removal and significantly lower rates of herbivory in branching habitats were consistent with the high biomass of this brown alga throughout the Keppel Islands and with its distribution on reef crests, where Lobophora biomass was 20 times greater in branching than in planar habitats. This lack of feeding by herbivorous fishes within branching coral habitats in the Keppel Islands contrasts with the typical role of coral and topographic complexity on herbivores on coral reefs and highlights the potential for complex interactions between algae, corals and fishes on coral reefs. On marginal systems, herbivory may modify algal distributions but may be unable to contain the proliferation of algae such as Lobophora.","[Bennett, S.; Bellwood, D.

Here, the effect of predation on the diversity and abundance of young coral reef fishes was experimentally examined in Moorea, French Polynesia. Effects of predators were quantified by monitoring recruitment of fishes onto standardized patch reefs in predator-exclosure cages or uncaged reefs. At the end of the 54-day experiment, recruits were 74% less abundant on reefs exposed to predators than on caged ones, and species richness was 42% lower on reefs exposed to predators. Effects of predators varied somewhat among families, however, rarefaction analysis indicated that predators foraged non-selectively among species.

The environmental heterogeneity of coral reef environments could be an important contributor to diversification, however, evidence supporting ecological speciation in corals is sparse. Here, we present data from a widespread coral species that reveals a strong association of host and symbiont lineages with specific habitats, consistent with distinct, sympatric gene pools that are maintained through ecologically-based selection. Methodology/Principal Findings: Populations of a common brooding coral, Seriatopora hystrix, were sampled from three adjacent reef habitats (spanning a similar to 30 m depth range) at three locations on the Great Barrier Reef (n = 336). The populations were assessed for genetic structure using a combination of mitochondrial (putative control region) and nuclear (three microsatellites) markers for the coral host, and the ITS2 region of the ribosomal DNA for the algal symbionts (Symbiodinium). Our results show concordant genetic partitioning of both the coral host and its symbionts across the different habitats, independent of sampling location. Conclusions/Significance: This study demonstrates that coral populations and their associated symbionts can be highly structured across habitats on a single reef. Coral populations from adjacent habitats were found to be genetically isolated from each other, whereas genetic similarity was maintained across similar habitat types at different locations. The most parsimonious explanation for the observed genetic partitioning across habitats is that adaptation to the local environment has caused ecological divergence of distinct genetic groups within S. hystrix.","[Bongaerts, Pim; Hoegh-Guldberg, Ove] Univ Queensland, Global Change Inst, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Bongaerts, Pim; Ridgway, Tyrone; Sampayo, Eugenia M.; Englebert, Norbert; Vermeulen, Francisca] Univ Queensland, Ctr Marine Studies, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Bongaerts, Pim; Sampayo, Eugenia M.; Hoegh-Guldberg, Ove] Univ Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Riginos, Cynthia] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Ridgway, Tyrone] Great Barrier Reef Marine Pk Author, Climate Change Grp, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Sampayo, Eugenia M.] Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [van Oppen, Madeleine J.

To mitigate this risk, information is needed on the biodiversity and location of habitats to develop a zone use plan. A rapid survey to document the biodiversity of macro-algae, sponges, corals and fishes was conducted. Here we report on the richness and condition of stony coral species at 18 select sites, and we test for the effects of bottom type, depth, and distance from platform edge. Species richness was visually assessed by roving scuba diver with voucher specimens of each species collected. Coral tissue was examined for bleaching and diseases. Thirty-three coral species were documented. There were no significant differences in coral composition among bottom types or depth classes (ANOSIM, P>0.05). There was a significant difference between sites (ANOSIM, P<0.05) near and far from the platform edge. The number of coral species observed ranged from zero and one in algal dominated habitats to 23 at a reef habitat on the southern edge of the Bank. Five reef sites had stands of Acropora cervicornis, a critically endangered species on the IUCN redlist. Bleaching was evident at 82% of the sites assessed with 43 colonies bleached. Only three coral colonies were observed to have disease. Combining our findings with that of other studies, a total of 43 species have been documented from Saba Bank. The coral assemblage on the bank is representative and typical of those found elsewhere in the Caribbean.

To improve our knowledge of this vast marine resource, a survey of biodiversity at Saba Bank included a multi-disciplinary team that sampled fishes, mollusks, crustaceans, macroalgae, and sponges. Methodology/Principal Findings: A single member of the dive team conducted surveys of sponge biodiversity during eight dives at six locations, at depths ranging from 15 to 30 m. This preliminary assessment documented the presence of 45 species pooled across multiple locations. Rarefaction analysis estimated that only 48 to 84% of species diversity was sampled by this limited effort, clearly indicating a need for additional surveys. An analysis of historical collections from Saba and Saba Bank revealed an additional 36 species, yielding a total of 81 sponge species recorded from this area. Conclusions/Significance: This observed species composition is similar to that found on widespread Caribbean reefs, indicating that the sponge fauna of Saba Bank is broadly representative of the Caribbean as a whole. A robust population of the giant barrel sponge, Xestospongia muta, appeared healthy with none of the signs of disease or bleaching reported from other Caribbean reefs; however, more recent reports of anchor chain damage to these sponges suggests that human activities can have dramatic impacts on these communities. Opportunities to protect this extremely large habitat should be pursued, as Saba Bank may serve as a significant reservoir of sponge species diversity.","[Thacker, Robert W.; Freeman, Christopher J.; Mobley, Andrew S.; LaPietra, Jessica; Cope, Kevin] Univ Alabama, Dept Biol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Cristina Diaz, M.] Museo Marino Margarita, Nueva Esparta, Venezuela; [de Voogd, Nicole J.] Natl Museum Nat Hist, Leiden, Netherlands; [van Soest, Rob W.

The presence of reef-like geomorphic features and significant shelf edge coral development on Saba Bank have led to the conclusion that it is an actively growing, though wholly submerged, coral reef atoll. However, little information exists on the composition of benthic communities or associated reef fish assemblages of Saba Bank. We selected a 40 km(2) area of the bank for an exploratory study. Habitat and reef fish assemblages were investigated in five shallow-water benthic habitat types that form a gradient from Saba Bank shelf edge to lagoon. Significant coral cover was restricted to fore reef habitat (average cover 11.5%) and outer reef flat habitat (2.4%) and declined to near zero in habitats of the central lagoon zone. Macroalgae dominated benthic cover in all habitats (average cover: 32.5-48.1%) but dominant algal genera differed among habitats. A total of 97 fish species were recorded. The composition of Saba Bank fish assemblages differed among habitat types. Highest fish density and diversity occurred in the outer reef flat, fore reef and inner reef flat habitats. Biomass estimates for commercially valued species in the reef zone (fore reef and reef flat habitats) ranged between 52 and 83 g/m(2). The composition of Saba Bank fish assemblages reflects the absence of important nursery habitats, as well as the effects of past fishing. The relatively high abundance of large predatory fish (i.e. groupers and sharks), which is generally considered an indicator of good ecosystem health for tropical reef systems, shows that an intact trophic network is still present on Saba Bank.","[Toller, Wes] Saba Conservat Fdn, Saba, Neth Antilles; [Debrot, Adolphe O.; Vermeij, Mark J.

In protogynous hermaphrodites there are hypothesised trade-offs among sex-specific growth, reproductive output and mortality. When differences in density lead to changes to social organization the link between growth and the timing of sex-change is predicted to change. The present study explores this prediction by comparing the social organisation and sex-specific growth of two populations of a protogynous tropical wrasse, Halichoeres miniatus, which differ in density. At a low density population a strict harem structure was found, where males maintained a tight monopoly of access and spawning rights to females. In contrast, at a high density population a loosely organised system prevailed, where females could move throughout multiple male territories. Otolith microstructure revealed the species to be annual and deposit an otolith check associated with sex-change. Growth trajectories suggested that individuals that later became males in both populations underwent a growth acceleration at sex-change. Moreover, in the high density population, individuals that later became males were those individuals that had the largest otolith size at hatching and consistently deposited larger increments throughout early larval, juvenile and female life. This study demonstrates that previous growth history and growth rate changes associated with sex change can be responsible for the sexual dimorphism typically found in sex-changing species, and that the relative importance of these may be socially constrained.","[McCormick, Mark I.; Ryen, Christopher A.; Munday, Philip L.; Walker, Stefan P.

Differences in Sargassum plant size and condition suggest that the variability in herbivore feeding intensity is attributed primarily to the variation in the condition of the macroalgae, especially epiphyte loads.

However, populations experiencing low but highly variable recruitment appear male limited and recruitment pulses carrying young males into the population are correlated to reproductive output with a 2-5-year lag. We conclude that pulses in recruitment can be a major structuring force in these limpet populations, but site-specific post-recruitment processes will determine the relative importance of recruitment to population dynamics and the lag between recruitment and reproductive output.","[Sundelof, Andreas; Svensson, Carl J.; Aberg, Per] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Marine Ecol, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Jenkins, Stuart R.; Hawkins, Stephen J.] Marine Biol Assoc UK, Plymouth PL1 2PB, Devon, England; [Delany, Jane] Newcastle Univ, Sch Marine Sci & Technol, Dove Marine Lab, Cullercoats NE30 4PZ, North Shields, England; [Jenkins, Stuart R.; Hawkins, Stephen J.] Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5EY, Anglesey, Wales",4,10.1007/s00227-009-1361-4,2010

Examination of larval sagittal otoliths revealed that instantaneous growth and daily growth during the first 2-3 weeks of life did not vary significantly between the two regions for either species. However, recent growth during the last two full days prior to collection was greater in the west for blue marlin larvae. Recent growth of blue marlin larvae < 9 mm SL (primarily zooplanktivorous) was significantly related to prey composition (faster growth when higher proportions of Farranula copepods were consumed). Western larvae grew faster and had higher proportions of Farranula in their guts. Trends for sailfish larvae were not significant. In both species, comparison of early growth between < 9 and a parts per thousand yen9 mm SL size groups indicated that growth trajectories diverged around 5-8 mm SL, the time when billfish larvae become capable of piscivory. Significantly faster growth of larger (older) larvae suggests that mortality was selective for fast growers and that the transition to piscivory may be a critical point in the early life of billfish.","[Sponaugle, Su; Walter, Kristen D.; Denit, Kelly L.; Llopiz, Joel K.; Cowen, Robert K.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA",14,10.1007/s00227-009-1366-z,2010

Unfortunately, these reefs have been recently subjected to local and regional disturbances. The objectives of this study were to determine whether there are potentially non-random processes forcing the observed coral diversity patterns, and highlight where and at which spatial scales these processes might be most influential. Methodology/Principal Findings: A hierarchical (nested) sampling design was employed across three spatial scales, ranging from transects (<= 20 m), stations (<100 m), to sites (<1000 m), to examine coral diversity patterns. Two of the four sites, Chumbe and Mnemba, were located within Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), while the other two sites, Changuu and Bawe, were not protected. Additive partitioning of coral diversity was used to separate regional (total) diversity (gamma) into local alpha diversity and among-sample beta diversity components. Individual-based null models were used to identify deviations from random distribution across the three spatial scales. We found that Chumbe and Mnemba had similar diversity components to those predicted by the null models. However, the diversity at Changuu and Bawe was lower than expected at all three spatial scales tested. Consequently, the relative contribution of the among-site diversity component was significantly greater than expected. Applying partitioning analysis for each site separately revealed that the within-transect diversity component in Changuu was significantly lower than the null expectation. Conclusions/Significance: The non-random outcome of the partitioning analyses helped to identify the among-sites scale (i.e., 10's of kilometers) and the within-transects scale (i.e., a few meters; especially at Changuu) as spatial boundaries within which to examine the processes that may interact and disproportionately differentiate coral diversity.

These reefs naturally contain a high percent cover of algal functional groups with relatively low coral abundance and exhibit thriving fish communities dominated by top predators. Despite their highly protected status, these reefs are at risk from both direct and indirect anthropogenic sources. This study provides the first comprehensive data on percent coverage of algae, coral, and non-coral invertebrates at the species level, and investigates spatial diversity patterns across the archipelago to document benthic communities before further environmental changes occur in response to global warming and ocean acidification. Monitoring studies show that non-calcified macroalgae cover a greater percentage of substrate than corals on many high latitude reef sites. Forereef habitats in atoll systems often contain high abundances of the green macroalga Microdictyon setchellianum and the brown macroalga Lobophora variegata, yet these organisms were uncommon in forereefs of non-atoll systems. Species of the brown macroalgal genera Padina, Sargassum, and Stypopodium and the red macroalgal genus Laurencia became increasingly common in the two northernmost atolls of the island chain but were uncommon components of more southerly islands. Conversely, the scleractinian coral Porites lobata was common on forereefs at southern islands but less common at northern islands.

Communities in marine environments are commonly composed of a few dominant taxa and a high number of taxonomically diverse, low-abundance organisms. However, studying the roles and genomic information of these ""rare'' organisms remains challenging, because little is known about their ecological niches and the environmental conditions to which they respond. Given the current threat to coral reef ecosystems, we investigated the potential of corals to provide highly specialized habitats for bacterial taxa including those that are rarely detected or absent in surrounding reef waters. The analysis of more than 350,000 small subunit ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) sequence tags and almost 2,000 nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that rare seawater biosphere members are highly abundant or even dominant in diverse Caribbean corals. Closely related corals (in the same genus/family) harbored similar bacterial communities. At higher taxonomic levels, however, the similarities of these communities did not correlate with the phylogenetic relationships among corals, opening novel questions about the evolutionary stability of coral-microbial associations. Large proportions of OTUs (28.7-49.1%) were unique to the coral species of origin. Analysis of the most dominant ribotypes suggests that many uncovered bacterial taxa exist in coral habitats and await future exploration. Our results indicate that coral species, and by extension other animal hosts, act as specialized habitats of otherwise rare microbes in marine ecosystems. Here, deep sequencing provided insights into coral microbiota at an unparalleled resolution and revealed that corals harbor many bacterial taxa previously not known. Given that two of the coral species investigated are listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, our results add an important microbial diversity-based perspective to the significance of conserving coral reefs.","[Sunagawa, Shinichi; Medina, Monica] Univ Calif Merced, Sch Nat Sci, Merced, CA USA; [Woodley, Cheryl M.] NOAA, Hollings Marine Lab, Ctr Coastal Environm Hlth & Biomol Res, Natl Ocean Serv, Charleston, SC USA",150,10.1371/journal.pone.0009554,2010

In the terrestrial environment, endemic species often face a high risk of extinction because of an association among three traits that threaten species persistence: small geographic range size, low abundance and ecological specialisation. To test whether these traits are associated in coral reef fishes, this study compared abundance and specialisation in endemic and widespread angelfishes at the remote Christmas and Cocos Islands in the Indian Ocean. The interrelationships among traits conferring high extinction risk in terrestrial communities did not apply to these fishes. Endemic angelfishes were 50-80 times more abundant than widespread species at these islands. Furthermore, there was no relationship between abundance and ecological specialisation. Endemic species were not more specialised than widespread congeners and endemics used similar resources to many widespread species. Three widespread species exhibited low abundance and some degree of specialisation, which may expose them to a greater risk of local extinction. For endemic species, high abundance and lack of specialisation on susceptible habitats may compensate for the global extinction risk posed by having extremely small geographic ranges. However, recent extinctions of small range reef fishes confirm that endemics are not immune to the increasing severity of large-scale disturbances that can affect species throughout their geographic range.","[Hobbs, Jean-Paul A.; Jones, G.

Parasitism in larval, recently settled and juvenile stages of a coral reef fish damselfish (Pomacentridae) was therefore investigated by quantifying the ontogenetic change in parasite load and comparing the growth rates of parasitized juvenile fish to those of unparasitized ones. Parasite prevalence in two lunar pulses of Pomacentrus moluccensis was 4 and 0% for larval stage fish, 34 and 56% for recently settled fish and 42 and 49% for juveniles. A significant increase in parasite prevalence with age group was found; the most marked increase occurred immediately after larval fish had settled. Standard length did not model prevalence well; as length is a proxy for age, this indicates that the higher prevalence in recently settled and juvenile fish compared with larvae was not a simple result of parasites accumulating with age. In one of three cohorts, there was some evidence that parasitism affected the growth rate of juveniles, as measured by otolith width. The study suggests that settling on the reef exposes young fish to potentially harmful parasites. This supports the idea that the pelagic phase may have the effect of reducing the exposure of young fish to the debilitating effects of parasites.","[Grutter, A. S.; McCallum, H.; Pickering, J.

Populations of C. vaginalis were highly structured (overall I broken vertical bar(ST) = 0.33), in some cases over distances as small as tens of kilometers. However, nonsignificant pairwise I broken vertical bar(ST) values were also found between a few relatively distant sampling sites suggesting that some long distance larval dispersal may occur via ocean currents or transport in sponge fragments along continuous, shallow coastlines. Indeed, sufficient gene flow appears to occur along the Florida reef tract to obscure a signal of isolation by distance, but not to homogenize COI haplotype frequencies.

The presence of heterogeneous environments throughout the volcanic Northern Mariana Islands (NMI), coupled with the availability of descriptive physical data, form the basis examining environmental-ecological relationships. Since 2003, coral abundances and macrobiota (all visibly recognizable taxa greater than 2 cm) occurrences have been estimated at 42 reef slopes along the volcanic archipelago. Analyses showed that reef types acted as surrogates of coral growth capacity and the modern assemblages residing upon them, being highest and most favorable, respectively, where relatively high salinity levels, low-to-moderate wave exposure, and an absence of volcanic activity for similar to 90 years existed. However, island size was the greatest constraint on species richness overall, but relations with corals were dampened by volcanic activity and increased for sponges and algae where greater connection with the island aquifer existed (i.e., relatively low salinity levels). The number of years since volcanic activity has occurred was positively related to the residuals of species-area relationships and coral cover, with a similar to 90-year time frame predicted for recovery. Notably, no relationships with watershed characteristics or distance from CNMI's main fishing port and coral-reef assemblages or species richness were found. Further examination of specific management concerns, such as fisheries and feral animal populations, should be designed to account for the inherent differences in driving environmental regimes. Management strategies focused upon conserving biodiversity and ecosystem function should be centered at the island level, matching the operational scale of dominant environmental-ecological relationships.

To accomplish this, bacterial clone libraries were constructed and sequenced from cultured isolates of Symbiodinium for the ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region. From these, 15 clones were subjected to PCR with a GC clamped primer set for DGGE analyses.

Larval supply and recruitment were measured for three regional endemic and four widespread non-endemic species using light traps, artificial collectors, and underwater visual censuses. Recruitment was correlated with larval supply in endemics but not in non-endemics, likely due to a combination of low larval supply and post-settlement survival of non-endemics. Surveys also indicated that endemics were far more abundant and occurred in more locations than closely related non-endemics.

Regime shifts, from coral to macro-algae dominated, alter the three-dimensional habitat structure in coral reef ecosystems. Surprisingly, few studies have looked at the effects for species that inhabit the reefs without being the architects of the three-dimensional structure. In this study the effects of a change in habitat characteristics on the community structure of large benthic foraminifera (LBF) is compared between an area with high (Kepulauan Seribu) and lower (Spermonde Archipelago) anthropogenic influence. The results indicate a general relationship between habitat and LBF assemblage structure. The largest difference was observed in shallow habitats. Habitats dominated by algae are inhabited by a specific group of LBF, the Calcarinidae, and domination of this group increases with higher algal prevalence. The fossil record of this group indicates that they evolved following a major change in settings of the central Indo-West-Pacific coral reefs from land detached platforms to fringing reefs, about 5 million years ago.

The effectiveness of foraminiferal and hard-coral assemblages as indicators of changes in water quality was assessed on 27 inshore reefs along the Great Barrier Reef. Environmental variables (i.e., several water quality and sediment parameters) and the composition of both benthic foraminiferal and hard-coral assemblages differed significantly between four regions (Whitsunday, Burdekin, Fitzroy, and the Wet Tropics). Grain size and organic carbon and nitrogen content of sediments, and a composite water column parameter (based on turbidity and concentrations of particulate matter) explained a significant amount of variation in the data (tested by redundancy analyses) in both assemblages. Heterotrophic species of foraminifera were dominant in sediments with high organic content and in localities with low light availability, whereas symbiont-bearing mixotrophic species were dominant elsewhere. A similar suite of parameters explained 89% of the variation in the FORAM index (a Caribbean coral reef health indicator) and 61% in foraminiferal species richness. Coral richness was not related to environmental setting. Coral assemblages varied in response to environmental variables, but were strongly shaped by acute disturbances (e.g., cyclones, Acanthaster planci outbreaks, and bleaching), thus different coral assemblages may be found at sites with the same environmental conditions. Disturbances also affect foraminiferal assemblages, but they appeared to recover more rapidly than corals. Foraminiferal assemblages are effective bioindicators of turbidity/light regimes and organic enrichment of sediments on coral reefs.","[Uthicke, S.; Thompson, A.; Schaffelke, B.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, PMB 3, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia",43,10.1007/s00338-009-0574-9,2010

At the time of settlement, these larvae need to locate a reef, and recent research indicates that sound emanating from reefs may act as a cue to guide them. Here, the auditory abilities of settlement-stage larvae of four species of coral reef fishes (families Pomacentridae, Lutjanidae and Serranidae) and similar-sized individuals of two pelagic species (Carangidae) were tested using an electrophysiological technique, auditory brainstem response (ABR). Five of the six species heard frequencies in the 100-2,000 Hz range, whilst one carangid species did not detect frequencies higher than 800 Hz. The audiograms of the six species were of similar shape, with best hearing at lower frequencies between 100 and 300 Hz. Strong within-species differences were found in hearing sensitivity both among the coral reef species and among the pelagic species. Larvae of the coral reef species had significantly more sensitive hearing than the larvae of the pelagic species. The results suggest that settlement-stage larval reef fishes may be able to detect reef sounds at distances of a few 100 m. If true hearing thresholds are lower than ABR estimates, as indicated in some comparisons of ABR and behavioural methods, the detection distances would be much larger.","[Wright, K.

The ecological, social, and economic value of coral reefs has made them an international conservation priority [2,3]. The success of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in restoring fish populations [4] has led to optimism that they could also benefit corals by indirectly reducing threats like overfishing, which cause coral degradation and mortality [2,5]. However, the general efficacy of MPAs in increasing coral reef resilience has never been tested. Methodology/Principal Findings: We compiled a global database of 8534 live coral cover surveys from 1969-2006 to compare annual changes in coral cover inside 310 MPAs to unprotected areas. We found that on average, coral cover within MPAs remained constant, while coral cover on unprotected reefs declined. Although the short-term differences between unprotected and protected reefs are modest, they could be significant over the long-term if the effects are temporally consistent. Our results also suggest that older MPAs were generally more effective in preventing coral loss. Initially, coral cover continued to decrease after MPA establishment. Several years later, however, rates of coral cover decline slowed and then stabilized so that further losses stopped. Conclusions/Significance: These findings suggest that MPAs can be a useful tool not only for fisheries management, but also for maintaining coral cover. Furthermore, the benefits of MPAs appear to increase with the number of years since MPA establishment. Given the time needed to maximize MPA benefits, there should be increased emphasis on implementing new MPAs and strengthening the enforcement of existing MPAs.","[Selig, Elizabeth R.] Univ N Carolina, Curriculum Ecol, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Selig, Elizabeth R.; Bruno, John F.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Marine Sci, Chapel Hill, NC USA",147,10.1371/journal.pone.0009278,2010

We conducted a global survey of MPAs containing coral reefs to investigate what factors are important in determining the size of fees charged to recreational SCUBA divers. The survey suggests that a negative perception about diving fees by managers is a more important predictor of fee size than the quality of diving, which can help explain the prevalently low size of diving fees. Decentralized fee systems and higher diving fees can help capture some of the surplus willingness to pay for diving in MPAs, but an excessive reliance on tourism for funding MPA management could expose coral reefs to damages.","[Wielgus, Jeffrey; Lewis, Tiffany B.; Gerber, Leah R.] Arizona State Univ, Dept Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Wielgus, Jeffrey; Balmford, Andrew] Univ Cambridge, Conservat Sci Grp, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; [Lewis, Tiffany B.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol & Marine Biol, Wilmington, NC 28403 USA; [Mora, Camilo] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada; [Mora, Camilo] Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA",14,10.1111/j.1755-263X.2009.00084.x,2010

Commonly, one organism lives in such close association within or near another that a spatial refuge occurs, whereby one of the organisms provides protection to the other. This is often the result of defenses of the host deterring an associate organism's consumers. In Moorea, French Polynesia, the range and abundance of the brown macroalga, Turbinaria ornata, have increased drastically since 1980 such that dense aggregations of this macroalga are a dominant component of the backreef habitat. Turbinaria ornata is both mechanically and chemically defended from herbivores. Other species of macroalgae grow within aggregations of Turbinaria and may benefit from these defenses. This study investigates whether aggregations of Turbinaria create a refuge from herbivory for associate macroalgae. When Turbinaria aggregations were removed experimentally, there was a significant increase in the number of associate algal species. Moreover, an herbivory assay using the palatable local alga Acanthophora spicifera identified herbivory as the mechanism for lower diversity on bommies lacking Turbinaria aggregations. The local increase in algal richness due to the refuge from herbivory afforded by Turbinaria may be an important contribution to macroalgal and community dynamics on reefs in Moorea, French Polynesia.","[Stewart, Hannah L.] CRIOBE, CNRS, UMS 2978, EPHE, Papetoai 98729, Moorea, Fr Polynesia; [Bittick, Sarah Joy; Bilotti, Nicholas D.; Peterson, Heather A.; Stewart, Hannah L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA USA",18,10.1007/s00227-009-1319-6,2010

A key to conserving these threatened corals is understanding how their populations are genetically interconnected throughout the greater Caribbean. Genetic research has demonstrated that gene flow is regionally restricted across the Caribbean in both species. Yet, despite being an important site of coral reef research, little genetic data has been available for the Florida Acropora, especially for the staghorn coral, A. cervicornis. In this study, we present new mitochondrial DNA sequence data from 52 A. cervicornis individuals from 22 sites spread across the upper and lower Florida Keys, which suggest that Florida's A. cervicornis populations are highly genetically interconnected (F(ST)=-0.081). Comparison between Florida and existing mtDNA data from six regional Caribbean populations indicates that Florida possesses high levels of standing genetic diversity (h = 0.824) relative to the rest of the greater Caribbean (h = 0.701 +/- 0.043). We find that the contemporary level of gene flow across the greater Caribbean, including Florida, is restricted (Phi(CT) = 0.117), but evidence from shared haplotypes suggests the Western Caribbean has historically been a source of genetic variation for Florida. Despite the current patchiness of A. cervicornis in Florida, the relatively high genetic diversity and connectivity within Florida suggest that this population may have sufficient genetic variation to be viable and resilient to environmental perturbation and disease. Limited genetic exchange across regional populations of the greater Caribbean, including Florida, indicates that conservation efforts for A. cervicornis should focus on maintaining and managing populations locally rather than relying on larval inputs from elsewhere.","[Hemond, Elizabeth M.; Vollmer, Steven V.] Northeastern Univ, Ctr Marine Sci, Nahant, MA 01908 USA",19,10.1371/journal.pone.0008652,2010

Here, we show for the first time that normal within-daytime fluctuations in temperature of less than 3 degrees C have large effects on personality for two species of juvenile coral reef fish in both observational and manipulative experiments. On average, individual scores on three personality traits (PTs), activity, boldness and aggressiveness, increased from 2.5- to sixfold as a function of temperature. However, whereas most individuals became more active, aggressive and bold across temperature contexts (were plastic), others did not; this changed the individual rank order across temperatures and thus altered personality. In addition, correlations between PTs were consistent across temperature contexts, e. g. fish that were active at a given temperature also tended to be both bold and aggressive. These results (i) highlight the importance of very carefully controlling for temperature when studying behavioural variation among and within individuals and (ii) suggest that individual differences in energy metabolism may contribute to animal personality, given that temperature has large direct effects on metabolic rates in ectotherms.","[Biro, Peter A.] Univ Technol Sydney, Dept Environm Sci, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia; [Beckmann, Christa] Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Water & Environm Resource Management, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia; [Beckmann, Christa] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Stamps, Judy A.] Univ Calif Davis, Sect Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA",142,10.1098/rspb.2009.1346,2010

A grand (total) mean of nineteen 22.3 ha coral reef reserves, protected for a mean duration of 8.2 years, were included in the meta-analyses. The overall density of fishes was higher in the reserves compared with the fished reefs and this difference was largely accounted for by exploited fishes. However, the overall density of fishes within the same reserves remained similar from the period before its establishment to several years following its establishment. Only the density of nonexploited fishes increased significantly during years subsequent to the establishment of the reserves. Neither age nor size of reserves correlated with pattern of change in fish density following the establishment of the reserves; however, fish density was consistently higher in larger and older reserves relative to smaller and younger reserves in the spatial comparison. Furthermore, well-enforced reserves had higher density of exploited fishes relative to less-enforced reserves in both spatial and temporal comparisons. In general, the magnitude and trajectory of change in fish density following the establishment of Philippine marine reserves are influenced by (1) functional groups of fishes under consideration, (2) size and age of the reserve, and (3) level of enforcement of the regulatory mechanisms necessary to sustain a marine reserve.","[Maliao, R.

Analysis of the largest spheres, both close to the external surface of the mouth and settled on the bottom of the small aerated aquaria, showed that they were irregularly bordered with residual mesentery tissue and contained clusters of spermatocysts.

Zooplankton were also significantly more abundant near the surface at night although gradients were most pronounced under moonlight. Zooplankton in a unidirectional current became concentrated near the surface within 2 m of departing a well-mixed trough immediately behind the reef crest, indicating that upward swimming behavior, rather than near-bottom depletion by reef planktivores, was the proximal cause of these gradients. Zooplankton were highly enriched near the surface before and after a full lunar eclipse but distributed evenly throughout the water column during the eclipse itself supporting light as a proximal cue for the upward swimming behavior of many taxa. This is the first investigation of the vertical distribution of zooplankton over a shallow back reef typical of island barrier reef systems common around the world. Previous studies on deeper fringing reefs found zooplankton depletion near the bottom but no enrichment aloft. In Moorea, where seawater is continuously recirculated out the lagoon and back across the reef crest onto the back reef, selection for upward swimming behavior may be especially strong, because the surface serves both as a refuge from predation and an optimum location for retention within the reef system. Planktivorous fish and corals that can forage or grow even marginally higher in the water column might have a substantial competitive advantage over those nearer the bottom on shallow reefs. Zooplankton abundance varied more over a few tens of centimeters vertical distance than it did between seasons or even between day and night indicating that great care must be taken to accurately assess the availability of zooplankton as food on shallow reefs.","[Alldredge, A.

Individual coral colonies, belonging to inshore patch reef communities of the Florida Keys, were followed through the 2005 mass bleaching event. Overall, coral bleaching patterns followed an index of accumulated thermal stress more closely than in situ temperature measurements. Eight coral species (Colpophyllia natans, Diploria strigosa, Montastraea cavernosa, M. faveolata, Porites astreoides, P. porites, Siderastrea siderea, and Stephanocoenia intersepta), representing >90% of the coral colonies studied, experienced intense levels of bleaching, but responses varied. Bleaching differed significantly among species: Colpophyllia natans and Diploria strigosa were most susceptible to thermal stress, while Stephanocoenia intersepta was the most tolerant. For colonies of C. natans, M. faveolata, and S. siderea, larger colonies experienced more extensive bleaching than smaller colonies. The inshore patch reef communities of the Florida Keys have historically been dominated by large colonies of Montastraea sp. and Colpophyllia natans. These results provide evidence that colony-level differences can affect bleaching susceptibility in this habitat and suggest that the impact of future thermal stress events may be biased toward larger colonies of dominant reef-building species. Predicted increases in the frequency of mass bleaching and subsequent mortality may therefore result in significant structural shifts of these ecologically important communities.","Univ Miami, Div Marine Biol & Fisheries, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA",37,10.1007/s00338-009-0548-y,2009

This article studies the effect of recruitment by coral and macroalgae on the resilience of grazed reef ecosystems. In particular, we focus on how larval connectivity affects regime shifts between alternative assemblages that are dominated either by corals or by macroalgae. Using a model with bistability dynamics, we show that recruitment of coral larvae erodes the resilience of a macroalgae-dominated ecosystem when grazing is high, but has negligible effect when grazing is low. Conversely, recruitment by macroalgae erodes the resilience of a coral-dominated ecosystem when grazing is low, leading to a regime shift to macroalgae. Thus, spillover of coral recruits from highly protected areas will not restore coral cover or prevent flips to macroalgae in the surrounding seascape if grazing levels in these areas are depleted, but may be pivotal for re-building coral populations if grazing is high. Fishing restrictions and the re-introduction of herbivores should therefore be a prime conservation objective for preventing undesirable regime shifts. Connectivity by some components of coral reef assemblages (e.g., macroalgae, pathogens, crown-of-thorns starfish) may be detrimental to sustaining reefs, especially where overfishing and other drivers have eroded their resilience, making them more vulnerable to a regime shift.","[Elmhirst, Toby; Connolly, Sean R.; Hughes, Terry P.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Connolly, Sean R.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld, Australia",38,10.1007/s00338-009-0530-8,2009

We found sand-sized brown grains within sediments aged 7,000-6,000 cal BP, and identified the grains as debris derived from a red soil layer developed in coastal zones around the Island. Temporal changes in the abundance of the debris suggest that water flow in the cave weakened at about 6,500 cal BP. Temporal changes in the cavernicolous bivalve assemblages indicate that the environmental conditions of the innermost cave area have gradually spread to the cave entrance over the past 5,000 years. These findings indicate that the filling of cavities within the reefal foundations of the cave has continued over time, resulting in a progressive decrease in the flux of water between the interior and exterior parts of the cave during at least the past 6,500 years. This indicates, in turn, a long-term decline in the functioning of the cryptic community within the reef as a source of the nutrients that support coral reef growth. Our findings regarding the distribution of debris from the red soil layer strongly support the occurrence of a mid-Holocene high-energy window, which represents a period of high wave energy prior to the formation of a reefal barrier.","[Yamamoto, N.; Kitamura, A.; Ohmori, A.; Morishima, Y.] Shizuoka Univ, Inst Geosci, Shizuoka 4228529, Japan; [Toyofuku, T.] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 2370061, Japan; [Ohashi, S.] Kaiyo Planning Co Ltd, Okinawa 9012102, Japan",9,10.1007/s00338-009-0536-2,2009

As such, the tissues of reef organisms are often exposed to intense solar radiation in clear tropical waters and have adapted to trap and harness photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). High levels of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) associated with sunlight, however, represent a potential problem in terms of tissue damage. Methodology/Principal Findings: By measuring UVR and PAR reflectance from intact and ground bare coral skeletons we show that the property of calcium carbonate skeletons to absorb downwelling UVR to a significant extent, while reflecting PAR back to the overlying tissue, has biological advantages. We placed cnidarians on top of bare skeletons and a UVR reflective substrate and showed that under ambient UVR levels, UVR transmitted through the tissues of cnidarians placed on top of bare skeletons were four times lower compared to their counterparts placed on a UVR reflective white substrate. In accordance with the lower levels of UVR measured in cnidarians on top of coral skeletons, a similar drop in UVR damage to their DNA was detected. The skeletons emitted absorbed UVR as yellow fluorescence, which allows for safe dissipation of the otherwise harmful radiation. Conclusions/Significance: Our study presents a novel defensive role for coral skeletons and reveals that the strong UVR absorbance by the skeleton can contribute to the ability of corals, and potentially other calcifiers, to thrive under UVR levels that are detrimental to most marine life.","[Reef, Ruth] Univ Queensland, Ctr Marine Studies, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; Univ Queensland, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, ARC, St Lucia, Qld, Australia",21,10.1371/journal.pone.0007995,2009

L. argentiventris recruits in mangroves, where juveniles remain until they are approximately 100 mm in length or 300-days-old. Back-calculated settlement dates and underwater surveys indicated a major recruitment peak during September and October, around 8 days before and after the full moon. The majority of mangrove sites in the Gulf of California had a similar L. argentiventris average size at the beginning of the settlement season for the cohort of 2003; although there were significant differences in individual sizes at the end of the nursery stage. When sub-adults leave mangroves, they live in shallow rocky reefs and later become abundant in deeper rocky reefs.

The technique, therefore, provides a new way of addressing questions about demographic population connectivity and larval export from no-take marine protected areas. However, successful field applications must be preceded by larval rearing studies that validate the geochemical marking technique, determine appropriate concentrations and demonstrate that larvae are not adversely affected. Here, we test whether injection of enriched stable barium isotopes ((135)Ba and (137)Ba) at two dose rates produces unequivocal marks on the otoliths of the coral reef grouper Epinephelus fuscoguttatus. We also assess potential negative effects on reproductive performance, egg size, condition and larval growth due to injection of adult female fish. The injection of barium isotopes at both 0.5 and 2.0 mg Ba/kg body weight into the body cavities of gravid female fish was 100% successful in the geochemical tagging of the otoliths of larvae from the first spawning after injection. The low-dose rate produced no negative effects on eggs or larvae. However, the higher dose rate of 2 mg Ba/kg produced small reductions in yolk sac area, oil globule area, standard length and head depth of pre-feeding larvae. Given the success of the 0.5 mg Ba/kg dose rate, it is clearly possible to produce a reliable mark and keep the concentration below any level that could affect larval growth or survival. Hence, enriched Ba isotope injections will provide an effective means of mass-marking grouper larvae.","[Williamson, David H.; Jones, Geoffrey P.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Williamson, David H.; Jones, Geoffrey P.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Thorrold, Simon R.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",23,10.1007/s00227-009-1276-0,2009

Phylogenetically nested within Labridae, the profound ecological impact and high species richness of parrotfishes suggest that their diversification and ecological success may be linked. Here, we ask whether parrotfish evolution is characterized by a significant burst of lineage diversification and whether parrotfish diversity is shaped more strongly by sexual selection or modifications of the feeding mechanism. We first examined scarid diversification within the greater context of labrid diversity. We used a supermatrix approach for 252 species to propose the most extensive phylogenetic hypothesis of Labridae to date, and time-calibrated the phylogeny with fossil and biogeographical data. Using divergence date estimates, we find that several parrotfish clades exhibit the highest diversification rates among all labrid lineages. Furthermore, we pinpoint a rate shift at the shared ancestor of Scarus and Chlorurus, a scarid subclade characterized by territorial behaviour and strong sexual dichromatism, suggesting that sexual selection was a major factor in parrotfish diversification. Modifications of the pharyngeal and oral jaws that happened earlier in parrotfish evolution may have contributed to this diversity by establishing parrotfishes as uniquely capable reef herbivores.","[Kazancioglu, Erem; Near, Thomas J.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Near, Thomas J.] Yale Univ, Peabody Museum Nat Hist, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Hanel, Reinhold] Fed Res Inst Rural Areas Forestry & Fisheries, Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst vTI, Inst Fisheries Ecol, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany; [Wainwright, Peter C.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Davis, CA 95616 USA",51,10.1098/rspb.2009.0876,2009

These microbes help maintain the holobiont homeostasis; thus, sustaining robust mutualistic microbial communities is a fundamental part of long-term coral reef survival. Coastal pollution is one major threat to reefs, and intensive fish farming is a rapidly growing source of this pollution. Methodology & Principal Findings: We investigated the susceptibility and resilience of the bacterial communities associated with a common reef-building coral, Porites cylindrica, to coastal pollution by performing a clonally replicated transplantation experiment in Bolinao, Philippines adjacent to intensive fish farming. Ten fragments from each of four colonies (total of 40 fragments) were followed for 22 days across five sites: a well-flushed reference site (the original fragment source); two sites with low exposure to milkfish (Chanos chanos) aquaculture effluent; and two sites with high exposure. Elevated levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), chlorophyll a, total heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria abundance, virus like particle (VLP) abundances, and culturable Vibrio abundance characterized the high effluent sites. Based on 16S rRNA clone libraries and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis, we observed rapid, dramatic changes in the coral-associated bacterial communities within five days of high effluent exposure. The community composition on fragments at these high effluent sites shifted towards known human and coral pathogens (i.e. Arcobacter, Fusobacterium, and Desulfovibrio) without the host corals showing signs of disease. The communities shifted back towards their original composition by day 22 without reduction in effluent levels. Significance: This study reveals fish farms as a likely source of pathogens with the potential to proliferate on corals and an unexpected short-term resilience of coral-associated bacterial communities to eutrophication pressure. These data highlight a need for improved aquaculture practices that can achieve both sustainable industry goals and long-term coral reef survival.",,51,10.1371/journal.pone.0007319,2009

Diseases are now recognized as a major cause of mortality in reef-forming corals and are complicit in phase shifts of reef ecosystems to algal-dominated states worldwide. Even so, factors contributing to disease occurrence, spread, and impact remain poorly understood. Ecosystem resilience has been linked to the conservation of functional diversity, whereas overfishing reduces functional diversity through cascading, top-down effects. Hence, we tested the hypothesis that reefs with trophically diverse reef fish communities have less coral disease than overfished reefs. We surveyed reefs across the central Philippines, including well-managed marine protected areas (MPAs), and found that disease prevalence was significantly negatively correlated with fish taxonomic diversity. Further, MPAs had significantly higher fish diversity and less disease than unprotected areas. We subsequently investigated potential links between coral disease and the trophic components of fish diversity, finding that only the density of coral-feeding chaetodontid butterflyfishes, seldom targeted by fishers, was positively associated with disease prevalence. These previously uncharacterized results are supported by a second large-scale dataset from the Great Barrier Reef. We hypothesize that members of the charismatic reef-fish family Chaetodontidae are major vectors of coral disease by virtue of their trophic specialization on hard corals and their ecological release in overfished areas, particularly outside MPAs.","[Raymundo, Laurie J.; Halford, Andrew R.; Kerr, Alexander M.] Univ Guam, Marine Lab, Mangilao, GU 96923 USA; [Maypa, Aileen P.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Zool, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",72,10.1073/pnas.0900365106,2009

The results highlighted two patterns: patterns 1, pre- and post-settlement individuals showing a ubiquitous distribution among the four habitats (Acanthuridae) and pattern 2, pre-settlement individuals distributed in all habitats, but post-settlement individuals restricted to coral (most species of Pomacentridae and Chaetodontidae) or seagrass habitats (Lethrinidae).

CO2 acidification had no detectable effect on embryonic duration, egg survival and size at hatching. In contrast, CO2 acidification tended to increase the growth rate of larvae. By the time of settlement (11 days post-hatching), larvae from some parental pairs were 15 to 18 per cent longer and 47 to 52 per cent heavier in acidified water compared with controls. Larvae from other parents were unaffected by CO2 acidification. Elevated CO2 and reduced pH had no effect on the maximum swimming speed of settlement-stage larvae. There was, however, a weak positive relationship between length and swimming speed. Large size is usually considered to be advantageous for larvae and newly settled juveniles.

Fishes often show relatively rapid declines in abundance when corals become stressed and die, but the processes responsible are largely unknown. This study explored the mechanism by which coral bleaching may influence the levels and selective nature of mortality on a juvenile damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis, which associates with hard coral. Recently settled fish had a low propensity to migrate small distances (40 cm) between habitat patches, even when densities were elevated to their natural maximum. Intraspecific interactions and space use differ among three habitats: live hard coral, bleached coral and dead algal-covered coral. Large fish pushed smaller fish further from the shelter of bleached and dead coral thereby exposing smaller fish to higher mortality than experienced on healthy coral. Small recruits suffered higher mortality than large recruits on bleached and dead coral. Mortality was not size selective on live coral. Survival was 3 times as high on live coral as on either bleached or dead coral.

Yet, quality assessments of these methods are typically qualitative or anecdotal. Quality is the correspondence of forecasts with observations and has standard quantitative measures. Here a forecast verification method, commonly used in meteorology, is presented and used to measure the quality of the degree heating weeks (DHW) technique as an exploration of insights that can be gleaned from this methodology. DHW values were calculated from NOAA Optimum Interpolation SST version 2 data and compared to a database of bleaching observations from 1990-2007. Quality is expressed with an objective measure, the Peirce Skill Score (PSS). The quality at varying DHW thresholds above which bleaching was projected to occur is calculated. By selecting the thresholds that maximize quality, the predictive technique is objectively optimized. This results in optimal threshold maps, showing reefs more prone and more resistant to bleaching. Optimization increases the quality of DHW as a predictor of bleaching from PSS = 0.55 to PSS = 0.83, in global average, but the optimal PSS and corresponding DHW values vary significantly from location to location. The coral reef research and management community are urged to adopt the simple, but rigorous tools of forecast verification routinely used in other disciplines so that bleaching forecasts can be quantitatively compared and their quality improved.","[van Hooidonk, R.; Huber, M.] Purdue Univ, Earth & Atmospher Sci & Purdue Climate Change Res, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",21,10.1007/s00338-009-0502-z,2009

A male removal experiment was used to examine changes in female growth and behaviour associated with sex change in the haremic wrasse Halichoeres miniatus and to test whether any changes in growth associated with sex change were recorded in otolith microstructure. Dominant females began displaying male-characteristic behaviour almost immediately after the harem male was removed. The frequency of interactions between females increased following male removal. In contrast, feeding frequency of females decreased. The largest one to three females in each social group changed sex following male removal and exhibited an increase in growth associated with sex change. Sex changers grew more than twice as fast as non-sex changers during the experimental period. This growth acceleration may enable new sex-changed males to rapidly reach a size where they can defend the remaining harem from other males. An optical discontinuity (check mark) was present in the otoliths of sex-changed fish, and otolith accretion rate increased significantly after the check mark, corresponding with the increased growth rate of sex-changing females. Wild caught males, but not females, exhibited an analogous check mark in their otoliths and similar increases in otolith increment widths after the check.

These data were combined with habitat maps and expert judgment on the vulnerability of different habitat types in the Monument to estimate spatial patterns of current cumulative impact at 1 ha (0.01 km(2)) resolution. Cumulative impact was greatest for shallow reef areas and peaked at Maro Reef, where 13 of the 14 threats overlapped in places. Ocean temperature variation associated with disease outbreaks was found to have the highest predicted impact overall, followed closely by other climate-related threats, none of which have easily tractable management solutions at the regional scale. High impact threats most tractable to regional management relate to ship traffic. Sensitivity analyses show that the results are robust to both data availability and quality. Managers can use these maps to (1) inform management and surveillance priorities based on the ranking of threats and their distributions, (2) guide permitting decisions based on cumulative impacts, and (3) choose areas to monitor for climate change effects.

This interpretation, based on geomorphology, depth, and exposure has provided 161 unit types distributed across 4,537 km(2) of reef area and 31,336 km(2) of non-reef area. In addition to shallow reefs (0-30 m) described by optical remote sensing, the bathymetry of deep slopes between -20 to -1,000 m were recently mapped using multibeam acoustic data providing additional data to explain the morphological diversity. With the detailed three-dimensional topographic information acquired, hitherto unrecognized marine terraces and faulting became visible, indicating different episodes of formation of the barrier reef and of sea level variations. Finally, dating and coring corals provided a more accurate understanding of the genesis of the present reef structures. In contrast with the synoptic remote sensing data, cores provided only point data, but allowed the addition of a precise temporal dimension to the description of New Caledonian reefs. Cores provided a significant body of the information necessary for the establishment of models of reef settlement and development during the last interglacial ages in the New Caledonian region. The combined examination of the different sources of data, and the exhaustive description of remotely sensed reef units, allow a qualitative synoptic parallel to be drawn between the morphology of modern reefs and the contrasting patterns of reef growth, subsidence, and uplift rates occurring around New Caledonia.","[Andrefouet, S.; Cabioch, G.; Flamand, B.; Pelletier, B.] Inst Rech Dev, Noumea, New Caledonia",43,10.1007/s00338-009-0503-y,2009

Individuals of the foraminifer Amphisorus hemprichii living in Papua New Guinea contained mixed communities of Symbiodinium dominated by symbiont types in clades C and F. Moreover, the types showed a distinct pattern in their distribution across the radius of the foraminifer, with clade F Symbiodinium more prevalent in the center of the host cell. The mixed community of symbionts and their pattern of distribution within the foraminifer is likely the result of processes happening both inside the foraminifer and in its external environment. Persistent mixed symbiont communities in foraminifera may be stabilized through benefits conferred by maintaining multiple symbiont lineages for symbiont shuffling. Alternatively they may be stabilized through a heterogeneous internal host environment, partitioning of symbiont functional roles or limitation of symbiont reproduction by the host. Six factors generally determine the presence of any particular symbiont type within a foraminifer: mode of transmission, availability from the environment, recognition by the host, regulation by the host, competition between lineages, and fitness of the holobiont.","[Fay, S.

The present study documented the temporal and spatial larval supply patterns of five Caribbean lizardfish species together with environmental variables (solar radiation, rainfall, water temperature, onshore-offshore winds, alongshore winds and wind-induced turbulence) to examine: (1) whether species within the same family respond differently to their developmental environment and (2) if larval supply in year-round warm waters is influenced by climatic changes. To address these questions, late-stage larvae of Synodus foetens, Synodus intermedius, Synodus poeyi, Saurida suspicio and Saurida brasiliensis were collected in replicate light traps in three different reef habitats (back-reef, lagoon and exposed) in the San Blas Archipelago, Panama, over 18 consecutive lunar months. Although replenishment of lizardfish occurred year-round, the temporal and spatial supply patterns were species-specific: S. foetens, S. intermedius and S. poeyi were most abundant during the dry season while S. suspicio and S. brasiliensis were most prevalent during the wet season. When seasons were analysed separately, water temperature explained 39 and 26% of the variance in light trap catches of S. foetens and S. intermedius, respectively, in the dry season while wind-induced turbulence accounted for 25% of the variability in S. suspicio and S. brasiliensis catches during the wet season. These findings stress the importance of analysing larval supply in conjunction with environmental data at a high taxonomic resolution to better understand the mechanisms that drive replenishment in reef systems at low latitudes.","[Lemberget, T.; McCormick, M.

Therefore, recovery of D. antillarum populations is critically important, but densities are still low on many reefs. Among the many potential factors limiting these densities, the focus of this study is on predation pressure by fishes. Marine reserves provide opportunities to examine large-scale manipulations of predator-prey interactions and, therefore, D. antillarum densities were compared inside and outside a reserve in The Bahamas (Exuma Cays Land and Sea Park; ECLSP). Urchins and their fish predators were surveyed at nine sites inside and outside the ECLSP. Because of lower fishing effort, the total biomass of urchin predators, weighted by their dietary preferences for urchins, was significantly higher inside the ECLSP. Furthermore, fish community structure was significantly different inside the Park because of the increased biomass of the majority of species. No urchins were seen inside the ECLSP and this was significantly lower than the density of 0.04 urchin m(-2) outside the Park. Regression analysis indicated that the relationship between the biomass of urchin predators and the proportion of transects containing urchins was non-linear, suggesting that small increases in fish biomass dramatically reduce urchin abundances. The link between lower density of urchins and higher density of their predators inside the ECLSP is strengthened by discounting five alternative primary mechanisms (variations in macroalgal cover, larval supply, environmental setting, density of other urchin species and abundance of predators not surveyed). Caribbean marine reserves have an important conservation role, but increased fish predation appears to reduce densities of D. antillarum. Urchins currently have limited functional significance on Bahamian reefs, but any future recovery of D. antillarum is likely to be limited in reserves, with potentially important ecological consequences.","[Harborne, A.

Recent studies using sea kraits (sea snakes) as bio-indicators suggest that the guild of predators represented by anguilliform fish (Congridae, Muraenidae, Ophichthidae, henceforth ""eels"" for simplicity) were far more abundant and diverse than previously suspected. In the current study, eel diversity (similarity and species richness indices) estimated via sea snake sampling (SSS) was compared among six areas of one of the main oceanic biodiversity hotspot of the Pacific Ocean (southwest lagoon of New Caledonia). Based on the eel diversity in the snakes' diet, the results obtained in six areas, in two snake species, and using different estimates (ANOSIM, Shannon indexaEuro broken vertical bar) were consistent, suggesting that SSS provided robust information. Analyses also suggested subtle, albeit significant, differences in the eel assemblages among islets. Such spatial differences are discussed in light of local management practices. As SSS is easy to use, cost-effective, and provides the best picture of eel assemblages to date, it can be employed to monitor the eel assemblages in addition to the snakes themselves in many areas of the Indo-Pacific Ocean, thereby providing an index of the top predator biodiversity of many coral reefs.","[Brischoux, Francois; Bonnet, Xavier; Legagneux, Pierre] CNRS, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France",9,10.1007/s00227-009-1229-7,2009

To test this hypothesis, we examined whether: (i) there was a relationship between the historical frequency of SST variability and stress experienced during the most recent thermal-stress events (in 1998 and 2005-2006) and (ii) coral reefs that historically experienced frequent thermal anomalies were less likely to experience coral bleaching during these recent thermal-stress events. Examination of nine detrended coral delta O-18 and Sr/Ca anomaly records revealed a high-(5.7-year) and low-frequency (>54-year) mode of SST variability. There was a positive relationship between the historical frequency of SST anomalies and recent thermal stress; sites historically dominated by the high-frequency mode experienced greater thermal stress than other sites during both events, and showed extensive coral bleaching in 1998. Nonetheless, in 2005-2006, corals at sites dominated by high-frequency variability showed reduced bleaching, despite experiencing high thermal stress. This bleaching resistance was most likely a consequence of rapid directional selection that followed the extreme thermal event of 1998. However, the benefits of regional resistance could come at the considerable cost of shifts in coral species composition.","[Thompson, D.

Although species richness in groups like mammals, birds, or teleost fishes is often attributed to accelerated cladogenesis, we lack a quantitative conceptual framework for identifying and comparing the exceptional changes of tempo in vertebrate evolutionary history. We develop MEDUSA, a stepwise approach based upon the Akaike information criterion for detecting multiple shifts in birth and death rates on an incompletely resolved phylogeny. We apply MEDUSA incompletely to a diversity tree summarizing both evolutionary relationships and species richness of 44 major clades of jawed vertebrates. We identify 9 major changes in the tempo of gnathostome diversification; the most significant of these lies at the base of a clade that includes most of the coral-reef associated fishes as well as cichlids and perches. Rate increases also underlie several well recognized tetrapod radiations, including most modern birds, lizards and snakes, ostariophysan fishes, and most eutherian mammals. In addition, we find that large sections of the vertebrate tree exhibit nearly equal rates of origination and extinction, providing some of the first evidence from molecular data for the importance of faunal turnover in shaping biodiversity. Together, these results reveal living vertebrate biodiversity to be the product of volatile turnover punctuated by 6 accelerations responsible for >85% of all species as well as 3 slowdowns that have produced ''living fossils."" In addition, by revealing the timing of the exceptional pulses of vertebrate diversification as well as the clades that experience them, our diversity tree provides a framework for evaluating particular causal hypotheses of vertebrate radiations.","[Alfaro, Michael E.; Santini, Francesco] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Brock, Chad; Alamillo, Hugo] Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Rabosky, Daniel L.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Rabosky, Daniel L.] Cornell Univ, Cornell Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Carnevale, Giorgio] Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Sci Terra, I-56100 Pisa, Italy; [Carnevale, Giorgio] Univ Pisa, Museo Storia Nat & Terr, I-56100 Pisa, Italy; [Harmon, Luke J.] Univ Idaho, Dept Biol, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Dornburg, Alex] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",473,10.1073/pnas.0811087106,2009

Mean maximum abundance of BBD reached 16+/-6 colonies per 100 m(2) (n=3 quadrats, each 100 m(2)) in summer, and decreased to 0-1 colony per 100 m(2) in winter. On average, BBD lesions caused 40 per cent tissue loss and 5 per cent of infections led to whole colony mortality. BBD reappearance on previously infected colonies and continuous tissue loss after the BBD signs had disappeared suggest that the disease impacts are of longer duration than indicated by the presence of characteristic signs. Rates of new infections and linear progression of lesions were both positively correlated with seasonal fluctuations in sea water temperatures and light, suggesting that seasonal increases in these environmental parameters promote virulence of the disease.

A fundamental question in coral reef ecology is whether chronic local stress reduces coral resistance and resilience from episodic stress such as bleaching, or alternatively promotes acclimatization, potentially increasing resistance and resilience. Here we show that following a major bleaching event, Montastraea faveolata coral growth rates at sites with higher local anthropogenic stressors remained suppressed for at least 8 years, while coral growth rates at sites with lower stress recovered in 2-3 years. Instead of promoting acclimatization, our data indicate that background stress reduces coral fitness and resilience to episodic events.

During a spawning event, fish ride large waves onshore to spawn on beach land, where their eggs incubate terrestrially. Here, we employ molecular markers to ascertain how this unusual reproductive behavior impacts genetic parentage. We developed and utilized four highly polymorphic microsatellite markers to assess maternal and paternal contributions in a total of 682 progeny from 17 nests of a natural population of L. tenuis. Alleles deduced to be of paternal origin in progeny were used to determine the minimum number of sires per nest and to estimate the true number of sires per nest via Bayesian analysis. We document the following: (a) no instances of multiple maternity for progeny within a nest; (b) a high frequency of nests (88%) with multiple paternity; and (c) an appreciable fraction of nests (18%) in which the estimated number of genetic sires (as many as nine) proved to be greater than the observed number of male attendants, thus implicating occasional extra-group fertilization events. From these and other observations, we also conclude that spawning behavior in grunions may involve site choice but not explicit mate choice.

The space available for reserves is limited, however, and conservation efforts must increasingly consider how management of protected areas can promote biodiversity beyond reserve borders. Habitat corridors are considered an important feature of reserves because they facilitate movement of organisms between patches, thereby increasing species richness in those patches. Here we demonstrate that by increasing species richness inside target patches, corridors additionally benefit biodiversity in surrounding non-target habitat, a biodiversity ""spillover'' effect. Working in the world's largest corridor experiment, we show that increased richness extends for approximately 30% of the width of the 1-ha connected patches, resulting in 10-18% more vascular plant species around patches of target habitat connected by corridors than around unconnected but otherwise equivalent patches of habitat. Furthermore, corridor-enhanced spillover into non-target habitat can be predicted by a simple plant life-history trait: seed dispersal mode. Species richness of animal-dispersed plants in non-target habitat increased in response to connectivity provided by corridors, whereas species richness of wind-dispersed plants was unaffected by connectivity and increased in response to changes in patch shape-higher edge-to-interior ratio-created by corridors.

Past studies have concluded that anthropogenic climate change may rapidly increase the frequency of these thermal stress events, leading to declines in coral cover, shifts in the composition of corals and other reef-dwelling organisms, and stress on the human populations who depend on coral reef ecosystems for food, income and shoreline protection. The ability of greenhouse gas mitigation to alter the near-term forecast for coral reefs is limited by the time lag between greenhouse gas emissions and the physical climate response. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study uses observed sea surface temperatures and the results of global climate model forced with five different future emissions scenarios to evaluate the ""committed warming'' for coral reefs worldwide. The results show that the physical warming commitment from current accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could cause over half of the world's coral reefs to experience harmfully frequent (p >= 0.2 year(-1)) thermal stress by 2080. An additional ""societal'' warming commitment, caused by the time required to shift from a business-as-usual emissions trajectory to a 550 ppm CO2 stabilization trajectory, may cause over 80% of the world's coral reefs to experience harmfully frequent events by 2030. Thermal adaptation of 1.5 degrees C would delay the thermal stress forecast by 50-80 years. Conclusions/Significance: The results suggest that adaptation - via biological mechanisms, coral community shifts and/or management interventions - could provide time to change the trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions and possibly avoid the recurrence of harmfully frequent events at the majority (97%) of the world's coral reefs this century. Without any thermal adaptation, atmospheric CO2 concentrations may need to be stabilized below current levels to avoid the degradation of coral reef ecosystems from frequent thermal stress events.",,119,10.1371/journal.pone.0005712,2009

This article highlights a recent dramatic increase in research effort and a growing diversity of approaches to the study of larval retention within (self-recruitment) and dispersal among (connectivity) isolated coral reef populations. Historically, researchers were motivated by alternative hypotheses concerning the processes limiting populations and structuring coral reef assemblages, whereas the recent impetus has come largely from the need to incorporate dispersal information into the design of no-take marine protected area (MPA) networks. Although the majority of studies continue to rely on population genetic approaches to make inferences about dispersal, a wide range of techniques are now being employed, from small-scale larval tagging and paternity analyses, to large-scale biophysical circulation models. Multiple approaches are increasingly being applied to cross-validate and provide more realistic estimates of larval dispersal. The vast majority of empirical studies have focused on corals and fishes, where evidence for both extremely local scale patterns of self-recruitment and ecologically significant connectivity among reefs at scales of tens of kilometers (and in some cases hundreds of kilometers) is accumulating. Levels of larval retention and the spatial extent of connectivity in both corals and fishes appear to be largely independent of larval duration or reef size, but may be strongly influenced by geographic setting. It is argued that high levels of both self-recruitment and larval import can contribute to the resilience of reef populations and MPA networks, but these benefits will erode in degrading reef environments.","[Jones, G.

Modeling of MPAs has shown how the persistence of metapopulations in systems of MPAs depends on the size and spacing of MPAs, and levels of fishing outside the MPAs. However, the pattern of demographic connectivity produced by larval dispersal is a key uncertainty in those modeling studies. The information required to assess population persistence is a dispersal matrix containing the fraction of larvae traveling to each location from each location, not just the current number of larvae exchanged among locations. Recent metapopulation modeling research with hypothetical dispersal matrices has shown how the spatial scale of dispersal, degree of advection versus diffusion, total larval output, and temporal and spatial variability in dispersal influence population persistence. Recent empirical studies using population genetics, parentage analysis, and geochemical and artificial marks in calcified structures have improved the understanding of dispersal. However, many such studies report current self-recruitment (locally produced settlement/settlement from elsewhere), which is not as directly useful as local retention (locally produced settlement/total locally released), which is a component of the dispersal matrix. Modeling of biophysical circulation with larval particle tracking can provide the required elements of dispersal matrices and assess their sensitivity to flows and larval behavior, but it requires more assumptions than direct empirical methods. To make rapid progress in understanding the scales and patterns of connectivity, greater communication between empiricists and population modelers will be needed. Empiricists need to focus more on identifying the characteristics of the dispersal matrix, while population modelers need to track and assimilate evolving empirical results.","[Botsford, L.

Ensuring that reserve populations are connected to each other and non-reserve populations by larval dispersal allows for recovery from disturbance and is a key aspect of resilience. In general, connectivity between reserves should increase as the distance between them decreases. However, enhancing connectivity may often tradeoff against a network's ability to representatively sample the system's natural variability. This ""representation"" objective is typically measured in terms of species richness or diversity of habitats, but has other important elements (e.g., minimizing the risk that multiple reserves will be impacted by catastrophic events). Such representation objectives tend to be better achieved as reserves become more widely spaced. Thus, optimizing the location, size and spacing of reserves requires both an understanding of larval dispersal and explicit consideration of how well the network represents the broader system; indeed the lack of an integrated theory for optimizing tradeoffs between connectivity and representation objectives has inhibited the incorporation of connectivity into reserve selection algorithms. This article addresses these issues by (1) updating general recommendations for the location, size and spacing of reserves based on emerging data on larval dispersal in corals and reef fishes, and on considerations for maintaining genetic diversity; (2) using a spatial analysis of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park to examine potential tradeoffs between connectivity and representation of biodiversity and (3) describing a framework for incorporating environmental fluctuations into the conceptualization of the tradeoff between connectivity and representation, and that expresses both in a common, demographically meaningful currency, thus making optimization possible.","[Almany, G.

Protecting ecological connectivity, within and among reefs, and between reefs and other ecosystems is critical to resilience. However, connectivity science is not yet able to clearly identify the specific measures for effective protection of connectivity. This article aims to provide a set of principles or practical guidelines that can be applied currently to protect connectivity. These 'rules of thumb' are based on current knowledge and expert opinion, and on the philosophy that, given the urgency, it is better to act with incomplete knowledge than to wait for detailed understanding that may come too late. The principles, many of which are not unique to connectivity, include: (1) allow margins of error in extent and nature of protection, as insurance against unforeseen or incompletely understood threats or critical processes; (2) spread risks among areas; (3) aim for networks of protected areas which are: (a) comprehensive and spread-protect all biotypes, habitats and processes, etc., to capture as many possible connections, known and unknown; (b) adequate-maximise extent of protection for each habitat type, and for the entire region; (c) representative-maximise likelihood of protecting the full range of processes and spatial requirements; (d) replicated-multiple examples of biotypes or processes enhances risk spreading; (4) protect entire biological units where possible (e.g. whole reefs), including buffers around core areas. Otherwise, choose bigger rather than smaller areas; (5) provide for connectivity at a wide range of dispersal distances (within and between patches), emphasising distances < 20-30 km; and (6) use a portfolio of approaches, including but not limited to MPAs. Three case studies illustrating the application of these principles to coral reef management in the Bohol Sea (Philippines), the Great Barrier Reef (Australia) and Kimbe Bay (Papua New Guinea) are described.","[McCook, L.

It is now clear that the spatial scale of disturbances to coral reef ecosystems is larger and the scale of larval connectivity is smaller than previously thought. This poses a challenge to the current focus of coral reef management, which often centers on the establishment of no-take reserves (NTRs) that in practice are often too small, scattered, or have low stakeholder compliance. Fished species are generally larger and more abundant in protected reserves, where their reproductive potential is often greater, yet documented demographic benefits of these reproductive gains outside reserves are modest at best. Small reproductive populations and limited dispersal of larvae play a role, as does the diminished receptivity to settling larvae of degraded habitats that can limit recruitment by more than 50%. For ""demographic connectivity"" to contribute to the resilience of coral reefs, it must function beyond the box of no-take reserves. Specifically, it must improve nursery habitats on or near reefs and enhance the reproductive output of ecologically important species throughout coral reef ecosystems. Special protection of ecologically important species (e.g., some herbivores in the Caribbean) and size-regulated fisheries that capitalize on the benefits of NTRs and maintain critical ecological functions are examples of measures that coalesce marine reserve effects and improve the resilience of coral reef ecosystems. Important too is the necessity of local involvement in the management process so that social costs and benefits are properly assessed, compliance increased and success stories accrued.","[Steneck, R.

Increased ocean temperatures are expected to accelerate larval development, potentially leading to reduced pelagic durations and earlier reef-seeking behaviour. Depending on the spatial arrangement of reefs, the expectation would be a reduction in dispersal distances and the spatial scale of connectivity. Small increase in temperature might enhance the number of larvae surviving the pelagic phase, but larger increases are likely to reduce reproductive output and increase larval mortality. Changes to ocean currents could alter the dynamics of larval supply and changes to planktonic productivity could affect how many larvae survive the pelagic stage and their condition at settlement; however, these patterns are likely to vary greatly from place-to-place and projections of how oceanographic features will change in the future lack sufficient certainty and resolution to make robust predictions. Connectivity could also be compromised by the increased fragmentation of reef habitat due to the effects of coral bleaching and ocean acidification. Changes to the spatial and temporal scales of connectivity have implications for the management of coral reef ecosystems, especially the design and placement of marine-protected areas. The size and spacing of protected areas may need to be strategically adjusted if reserve networks are to retain their efficacy in the future.","[Munday, P. L.; Lough, J. M.; Kingsford, M.

Connectivity was inferred by tracking surface water features in weekly climatologies and a time series of weekly mean chlorophyll-a concentrations derived from satellite imagery. Frequency of spatial connections between 17 pre-defined, geomorphological domains that include the major reefs in the MBRS and river deltas in Honduras and Nicaragua were recorded and tabulated as percentage of connections. The 9-year time series of 466 weekly mean images portrays clearly the seasonal patterns of connectivity, including river plumes and transitions in the aftermath of perturbations such as hurricanes. River plumes extended offshore from the Honduras coast to the Bay Islands (Utila, Cayo Cochinos, Guanaja, and Roatan) in 70% of the weekly mean images. Belizean reefs, especially those in the southern section of the barrier reef and Glovers Atoll, were also affected by riverine discharges in every one of the 9 years. Glovers Atoll was exposed to river plumes originating in Honduras 104/466 times (22%) during this period. Plumes from eastern Honduras went as far as Banco Chinchorro and Cozumel in Mexico. Chinchorro appeared to be more frequently connected to Turneffe Atoll and Honduran rivers than with Glovers and Lighthouse Atolls, despite their geographic proximity. This new satellite data analysis provides long-term, quantitative assessments of the main pathways of connectivity in the region. The percentage of connections can be used to validate predictions made using other approaches such as numerical modeling, and provides valuable information to ecosystem-based management in coral reef provinces.","[Soto, I.; Hu, C.; Wall, C.

H. musciformis does not sexually reproduce in Hawaii and drifting fragments represent the only pathway by which H. musciformis can disperse and invade new areas. Growth rates decreased with age and approached zero when fragments aged 32 days. Increased nutrient availability did not result in increased relative growth rates during this period. In contrast to growth, photosynthetic performance remained unaffected through time and showed no clear relationship with nutrient availability. Increased nutrient availability increased fragment survival and fragments survived for > 2 months in the high nutrient treatment (3.0 mu molPO(4) + 30.0 mu molNH(4)). This indicates that increased nutrient availability increases the dispersal potential of H. musciformis. Low growth rates of drifting Hypnea fragments increased recruitment success since attachment success of this epiphytic species decreased with increasing fragment size. H. musciformis thus uses resources for survival and maintenance rather than growth, resulting in long competency periods and optimal recruitment, which likely contribute to its success as an invader of Hawaiian reef communities.","[Vermeij, M.

To examine how water flow affects the distribution and feeding performance of two species of planktivorous tube blennies (Chaenopsidae), flow speed and turbulence were measured within the feeding areas of Acanthemblemaria spinosa and A. aspera at three sites within Glover's Reef, Belize. Although co-occurring, A. spinosa occupies topographically high locations (e.g., upright coral skeletons) while A. aspera occupies topographically low shelters in the coral pavement. Boundary layer theory predicts that A. spinosa should experience higher flow (and a higher flux of planktonic food) relative to A. aspera; however, complex topography and oscillatory flow require that this prediction is tested directly in the field. Within each site, the flow experienced by A. spinosa was, indeed, faster and more turbulent than that experienced by A. aspera at site-specific intermediate wave heights. When waves were small, gentle velocity gradients produced similar flows for the two species. When waves were high, flow was uniformly fast through the water column due to thinning of the benthic boundary layer. Plankton availability was similar for the species, with the exception of a greater abundance of harpacticoid copepods at the shelters of A. aspera. Quantitative behavioral observations suggest that the foraging strategies employed by the two fishes exploit the prevailing hydrodynamic conditions. For example, A. spinosa, the stronger swimmer of the two, attacks nearly 100% of the time in the water column where it can exploit the higher flux of plankton associated with faster flows, while A. aspera attacks primarily toward the reef surface where currents are likely to be slower and it can exploit more abundant benthic prey.","[Finelli, C.

Individual fish were subjected to unidirectional (smooth and turbulent) and oscillatory flows while they fed on calanoid copepods, Acartia tonsa, whose vulnerability to predation varies with water flow.

Under all conditions, Acanthemblemaria spinosa exhibited greater foraging effort and attacked at greater distances, greater mean water speeds, and in oscillatory flow, over a greater proportion of the wave cycle than did A. aspera. A. spinosa also exhibited greater foraging success under turbulent flow conditions. These differences in feeding patterns allow A. spinosa, with its higher metabolic rate, to occupy the more energetic higher locations in corals where planktonic food is more abundant. A. aspera occupies the poorer quality habitat in terms of planktonic food availability but its lower metabolic rate allows it to thrive there. Consequently, these species divide the resource in short supply, i.e., shelter holes, based on their differing abilities to capture prey in energetic water conditions in conjunction with their differing food energy requirements.","[Clarke, R.

Settlement at two sites in southwest Puerto Rico was also examined as a comparison of present-day settlement rates at a site where D. antillarum recovery has been moderate. Monthly settlement rates were low (max < 2 m(-2)) and did not differ between the two sites examined in the Florida Keys. Settlement was significantly higher at only one of the Puerto Rico sites (max 16 m(-2)), but still an order of magnitude lower than that reported for historic populations in Cura double dagger ao (1982-83).

Both P. microlepis and P. unifasciata juveniles under 80 mm TL exhibited no aggressive chases towards conspecifics or other species, while above 80 mm TL aggressive chase frequency increased in conjunction with an increase in home range, defended as a territory. Ontogenetic diet shifts, characterised by an increase in herbivory (P. unifasciata: juveniles: 64% plant material, adults: 95% plant material; P. microlepis: juveniles: 43% plant material, adults: 67% plant material) were observed for both species. The ratio of digestive tract length to body length, which often accompanies a switch to herbivory, increased significantly with ontogeny for both species.

Studies in laboratories and artificial setups have shown that the presence of conspecific adults often serves as a positive settlement cue, whose value is explained by the increased survival of juveniles in an already proven fit environment. However, settlement in already inhabited corals may expose the recruits to adult aggression. Daily observations and manipulation experiments were used in the present study, which was conducted in the natural reef. We revealed differential strategies of settlers, which do not necessarily join conspecific adults. Dascyllus aruanus prefer to settle near (not with) their aggressive adults, and to join them only after gaining in size; whereas Dascyllus marginatus settlers in densely populated reefs settle independently of their adult distribution. Our results present different solutions to the challenges faced by fish recruits while selecting their microhabitat, and emphasize the complexity of habitat selection by the naive settlers. Although laboratory experiments are important to the understanding of fish habitat selection, further studies in natural habitats are essential in order to elucidate the actual patterns of settlement and habitat selection, which are crucial for the survival of coral-reef fish populations.",,20,10.1371/journal.pone.0005511,2009

The cues that trigger adaptive colour change are often unclear, and the role of colour vision remains largely untested. Here, we investigated the bluestriped fangblenny (Plagiotremus rhinorhynchos), an aggressive mimic that changes its body coloration to impersonate a variety of coral reef fishes. In this field, we determined the fish species that the fangblenny associated with and measured the spectral reflectance of mimics and their models. We measured the spectral absorbance characteristics of the retinal photoreceptor visual pigments in the bluestriped fangblenny using microspectrophotometry and found it to have rod photoreceptors (lambda(max) 498 nm), single cones (449 nm) and double cones (561 nm principal member; 520 nm accessory member). Using theoretical vision models, fangblennies could discriminate between the colours they adopted and the colours of the fish they associated with. Potential signal receivers (Abudefduf abdominalis and Ctenochaetus strigosus) perceived colours of most mimics to closely resemble fishes they associated with. However, fishes with ultraviolet-sensitive visual pigments were better at discriminating between mimics and models. Therefore, colour vision could be used by fangblennies when initiating colour change enabling them to accurately resemble fishes they associate with and to avoid detection by signal receivers.","[Cheney, Karen L.] Univ Queensland, Sch Integrat Biol, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Skogh, Charlotta; Hart, Nathan S.; Marshall, N.

Specifically, this study analyzed presence and diversity of predatory reef fishes over a gradient of human population density. Across the region, as human population density increases, presence of large-bodied fishes declines, and fish communities become dominated by a few smaller-bodied species. Conclusions/Significance: Complete disappearance of several large-bodied fishes indicates ecological and local extinctions have occurred in some densely populated areas.

But for MPA networks to be successful in protecting marine populations, individual MPAs must be self-sustaining or adequately connected to other MPAs via dispersal. For marine species with a dispersive larval stage, populations within MPAs require either the return of settlement-stage larvae to their natal reserve or connectivity among reserves at the spatial scales at which MPA networks are implemented. To date, larvae have not been tracked when dispersing from one MPA to another, and the relative magnitude of local retention and connectivity among MPAs remains unknown. Here we use DNA parentage analysis to provide the first direct estimates of connectivity of a marine fish, the orange clownfish (Amphiprion percula), in a proposed network of marine reserves in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea. Approximately 40% of A. percula larvae settling into anemones in an island MPA at 2 different times were derived from parents resident in the reserve. We also located juveniles spawned by Kimbe Island residents that had dispersed as far as 35 km to other proposed MPAs, the longest distance that marine larvae have been directly tracked. These dispersers accounted for up to 10% of the recruitment in the adjacent MPAs. Our findings suggest that MPA networks can function to sustain resident populations both by local replenishment and through larval dispersal from other reserves. More generally, DNA parentage analysis provides a direct method for measuring larval dispersal for other marine organisms.","[Planes, Serge] Univ Perpignan, Unite Mixte Rech 5542, CNRS EPHE UPVD, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Planes, Serge] CRIOBE, UMS EPHE CNRS 2978, Moorea, Fr Polynesia; [Jones, Geoffrey P.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Jones, Geoffrey P.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Thorrold, Simon R.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",267,10.1073/pnas.0808007106,2009

This study examined the effects of habitat disturbances on species richness of coral reef fish assemblages using annual surveys of habitat and 210 fish species from 10 reefs on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Over a period of 11 years, major disturbances, including localised outbreaks of crown-of-thorns sea star (Acanthaster planci), severe storms or coral bleaching, resulted in coral decline of 46-96% in all the 10 reefs. Despite declines in coral cover, structural complexity of the reef framework was retained on five and species richness of coral reef fishes maintained on nine of the disturbed reefs. Extensive loss of coral resulted in localised declines of highly specialised coral-dependent species, but this loss of diversity was more than compensated for by increases in the number of species that feed on the epilithic algal matrix (EAM). A unimodal relationship between areal coral cover and species richness indicated species richness was greatest at approximately 20% coral cover declining by 3-4 species (6-8% of average richness) at higher and lower coral cover.

However, coral reefs are now experiencing global declines and many hawksbill populations are critically reduced. For endangered species, tracking movement has been recognized as fundamental to management. Since movements in marine vertebrates encompass three dimensions, evaluation of diving behavior and range is required to characterize marine turtle habitat. In this study, habitat use of hawksbill turtles on a Caribbean coral reef was elucidated by quantifying diel depth utilization and movements in relation to the boundaries of marine protected areas. Time depth recorders (TDRs) and ultrasonic tags were deployed on 21 Cayman Islands hawksbills, ranging in size from 26.4 to 58.4 cm straight carapace length. Study animals displayed pronounced diel patterns of diurnal activity and nocturnal resting, where diurnal dives were significantly shorter, deeper, and more active. Mean diurnal dive depth (+/- SD) was 8 +/- A 5 m, range 2-20 m, mean nocturnal dive depth was 5 +/- A 5 m, range 1-14 m, and maximum diurnal dive depth was 43 +/- A 27 m, range 7-91 m. Larger individuals performed significantly longer dives. Body mass was significantly correlated with mean dive depth for nocturnal but not diurnal dives. However, maximum diurnal dive depth was significantly correlated with body mass, suggesting partitioning of vertical habitat by size. Thus, variable dive capacity may reduce intraspecific competition and provide resistance to degradation in shallow habitats. Larger hawksbills may also represent important predators on deep reefs, creating a broad ecological footprint over a range of depths.","[Blumenthal, J. M.; Austin, T. J.; Bothwell, J.

As part of an extensive adaptive management strategy built around a network of protected areas, an emphasis was placed on understanding this important species' life history. Multiple capture-mark-recapture techniques and a model selection approach to data analysis in Program MARK were used to estimate the effects of individual age and conspecific density on natural per-capita daily survival probabilities of yellow tang recruits (recently settled individuals, 30-50 mm total length) and the effects of body size and site on natural per-capita monthly survival probabilities for juveniles (58-127 mm total length). The models of recruit survival that included additive effects of density and age were best supported by the data and indicated an increase of survival with age and decrease of survival with increased conspecific density. At 1 day post-settlement, the model averaged daily per-capita survival probability ranged from 0.963 (95% CI: 0.932-0.981) at a low density of 0.1 recruits m(-2) to 0.848 (95% CI: 0.752-0.911) at a high density of 1.3 recruits m(-2). The best supported model of juvenile survival had no effect of fish length or site, with a constant monthly per-capita survival of 0.939 (95% CI: 0.925-0.950). Only about 1% of recruits may survive to adulthood when protected from fishing. These results can be used to better analyze and interpret data from protected area monitoring surveys and refine management practices. Continued long-term monitoring, combined with targeted life history studies and demographic modeling, is needed to further investigate the population level effects of fishing yellow tang juveniles.","[Claisse, J.

Using a remote video bioassay approach, this study quantified herbivory in three bays along the leeward margin of Orpheus Island. Despite significant with-in bay variation in herbivory there was no detectable statistical difference in the rates of herbivory among bays. Furthermore, of the 45 herbivore species recorded from the island, only three played a significant role in bioassay removal, Siganus canaliculatus, Siganus javus and Kyphosus vaigiensis, with only one species predominating in each bay.

This work reports a new stress-related skeletal structure we term clypeotheca. Clypeotheca was observed in several live-collected common reef-building coral genera and a two to three kya subfossil specimen from Heron Reef, Great Barrier Reef and consists of an epitheca-like skeletal wall that seals over the surface of parts of the corallum in areas of stress or damage. It appears to form from a coordinated process wherein neighboring polyps and adjoining coenosarc seal themselves off from the surrounding environment as they contract and die. Clypeotheca forms from inward skeletal centripetal growth at the edges of corallites and by the merging of flange-like outgrowths that surround individual spines over the surface of the coenosteum. Microstructurally, the merged flanges are similar to upside-down dissepiments and true epitheca. Clypeotheca is interpreted primarily as a response to stress that may help protect the colony from invasion of unhealthy tissues by parasites or disease by retracting tissues in areas that have become unhealthy for the polyps. Identification of skeletal responses of corals to environmental stress may enable the frequency of certain types of environmental stress to be documented in past environments. Such data may be important for understanding the nature of reef dynamics through intervals of climate change and for monitoring the effects of possible anthropogenic stress in modern coral reef habitats.","[Nothdurft, L.

Population recovery may depend strongly on colonization capabilities of the affected species. The giant barrel sponge Xestospongia muta is a dominant reef constituent in the Caribbean. However, little is known about its population structure and gene flow. The 5'-end fragment of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase subunit I is often used to address these kinds of questions, but it presents very low intraspecific nucleotide variability in sponges. In this study, the usefulness of the I3-M11 partition of COI to determine the genetic structure of X. muta was tested for seven populations from Florida, the Bahamas and Belize. A total of 116 sequences of 544 bp were obtained for the I3-M11 partition corresponding to four haplotypes. In order to make a comparison with the 5'-end partition, 10 sequences per haplotype were analyzed for this fragment. The 40 resulting sequences were of 569 bp and corresponded to two haplotypes. The nucleotide diversity of the I3-M11 partition (pi = 0.00386) was higher than that of the 5'-end partition (pi = 0.00058), indicating better resolution at the intraspecific level. Sponges with the most divergent external morphologies (smooth vs. digitate surface) had different haplotypes, while those with the most common external morphology (rough surface) presented a mixture of haplotypes. Pairwise tests for genetic differentiation among geographic locations based on F (ST) values showed significant genetic divergence between most populations, but this genetic differentiation was not due to isolation by distance. While limited larval dispersal may have led to differentiation among some of the populations, the patterns of genetic structure appear to be most strongly related to patterns of ocean currents. Therefore, hydrological features may play a major role in sponge colonization and need to be considered in future plans for management and conservation of these important components of coral reef ecosystems.","[Lopez-Legentil, S.; Pawlik, J.

Consequently, zooxanthellae (Symbiodinium spp.) must continually photoacclimate to optimise productivity and ensure coral success. In situ coral photobiology is becoming dominated by routine assessments using state-of-the-art non-invasive bio-optical or chlorophyll a fluorescence (bio-physical) techniques. Multiple genetic types of Symbiodinium are now known to exist; however, little focus has been given as to how these types differ in terms of characteristics that are observable using these techniques. Therefore, this investigation aimed to revisit and expand upon a pivotal study by Iglesias-Prieto and Trench (1994) by comparing the photoacclimation characteristics of different Symbiodinium types based on their bio-physical (chlorophyll a fluorescence, reaction centre counts) and bio-optical (optical absorption, pigment concentrations) 'signatures'. Signatures described here are unique to Symbiodinium type and describe phenotypic responses to set conditions, and hence are not suitable to describe taxonomic structure of in hospite Symbiodinium communities. In this study, eight Symbiodinium types from clades and sub-clades (A-B, F) were grown under two PFDs (Photon Flux Density) and examined. The photoacclimation response by Symbiodinium was highly variable between algal types for all bio-physical and for many bio-optical measurements; however, a general preference to modifying reaction centre content over effective antennae-absorption was observed. Certain bio-optically derived patterns, such as light absorption, were independent of algal type and, when considered per photosystem, were matched by reaction centre stoichiometry. Only by better understanding genotypic and phenotypic variability between Symbiodinium types can future studies account for the relative taxonomic and physiological contribution by Symbiodinium to coral acclimation.","[Hennige, S.

Net photosynthesis and calcification rates were measured by in situ incubations at 10 sites that included six of the defined communities, and which occupied most of the area on the reef flat and slope. Net photosynthesis on the reef flat was positive overall, but the reef flat acts as a source for atmospheric CO2, because the measured calcification/photosynthesis ratio of 2.5 is greater than the critical ratio of 1.67. Net photosynthesis on the reef slope was negative. Almost all excess organic production from the reef flat is expected to be effused to the outer reef and consumed by the communities there. Therefore, the total net organic production of the whole reef system is probably almost zero and the whole reef system also acts as a source for atmospheric CO2. Net calcification rates of the reef slope corals were much lower than those of the branching corals. The accumulation rate of the former was approximately 0.5 m kyr(-1) and of the latter was 0.7-5 m kyr(-1). Consequently, reef slope corals could not grow fast enough to keep up with or catch up to rising sea levels during the Holocene. On the other hand, the branching corals grow fast enough to keep up with this rising sea level. Therefore, a transition between early Holocene and present-day reef communities is expected. Branching coral communities would have dominated while reef growth kept pace with sea level rise, and the reef was constructed with a branching coral framework. Then, the outside of this framework was covered and built up by reef slope corals and present-day reefs were constructed.","[Nakamura, T.; Nakamori, T.] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Inst Geol & Paleontol, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan",24,10.1007/s00338-008-0454-8,2009

It was hypothesized that both taxa would show strong preferences to different environments and benthic cover and that patterns would be consistent through time. Plectropomus leopardus were abundant on the reef slope and seaward edge of the lagoon, where live coral cover was high, and recruitment was generally low, in all environments. The population was sustained by a trickle of recruits, and total abundance varied little after 10 to 25 yr of protection in a no-take area, suggesting P. leopardus had reached an environment-related carrying capacity. Protogynous P. leopardus recruited to shallow environments at sites with 20% or more hard live coral and age data indicated the abundance of fish on the reef slope was from redistribution. Most recruits of gonochoristic L. carponotatus (< 150 mm Standard length, SL) were found in the lagoonal environments, and adults were rare on the reef slope. Abundance of recruit L. carponotatus and P. leopardus did not correlate with percent cover of live and soft coral within environments. Recruits of L. carponotatus were usually rare in all lagoonal environments, but in 2003, many recruits (80 to 120 mm SL) were found in lagoonal environments with low and high hard live coral cover. A substantial proportion of the population (age max 18 yr) was from strong recruitment events. In 2003 and 2004, total abundance of L. carponotatus was supported by 1 year class 51.7 and 41% respectively.

In Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea, surveys were used to quantify microhabitat use and selectivity in two live-coral specialist damselfishes (Pomacentridae), Chrysiptera parasema, and Dascyllus melanurus. A patch reef experiment was then conducted to test how intra- and interspecific competition interacts with two types of microhabitat to influence survival of recently settled C. parasema. Surveys demonstrated that C. parasema and D. melanurus recruits utilized similar coral microhabitats; 72% of C. parasema and 85% of D. melanurus used corymbose and bottlebrush growth forms of Acropora. One microhabitat type, Pocillopora sp. coral, was commonly used by D. melanurus but rarely by C. parasema. The patch reef experiment revealed that both microhabitat and interspecific competition influence abundance of recently settled C. parasema. Microhabitat had the strongest influence on survival of C. parasema. In the absence of interspecific competitors, 85% of C. parasema survived for 5 days after transplantation to high-complexity bottlebrush Acropora reefs when compared to only 25% survival of Pocillopora reefs. In both microhabitats, interspecific competition with D. melanurus, but not intraspecific competition, significantly decreased the survival of C. parasema. Taken together, these results suggest that the observed distribution of C. parasema results from specialized microhabitat requirements and competition for space in those microhabitats. This study demonstrates that interspecific competition and microhabitat type can interact to influence early post-settlement survival in coral reef fishes, though, whether and how these factors influence survival will depend on the behavioural attributes and strength of habitat associations among potential competitors.","[Bonin, M.

Juvenile bicolor damselfish (Stegastes partitus) were sampled at 13 sites along the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (MBRS), the barrier reefs on the east coast of Central America extending from the Yucatan, Mexico to Honduras, to evaluate genetic structure among recently settled cohorts. Using genotype data at eight microsatellite loci genetic structure was estimated at large and small spatial scales using exact tests for allele frequency differences and hierarchical analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA). Isolation-by-distance models of divergence were assessed at both spatial scales. Results showed genetic homogeneity of recently settled S. partitus at large geographic scales with subtle, but significant, genetic structure at smaller geographic scales. Genetic temporal stability was tested for using archived juvenile S. partitus collected earlier in the same year (nine sites), and in the previous year (six sites). The temporal analyses indicated that allele frequency differences among sites were not generally conserved over time, nor were pairwise genetic distances correlated through time, indicative of temporal instability. These results indicate that S. partitus larvae undergo high levels of dispersal along the MBRS, and that the structure detected at smaller spatial scales is likely driven by stochastic effects on dispersal coupled with microgeographic effects. Temporal variation in juvenile cohort genetic signature may be a fundamental characteristic of connectivity patterns in coral reef fishes, with various species and populations differing only in the magnitude of that instability. Such a scenario provides a basis for the reconciliation of conflicting views regarding levels of genetic structuring in S. partitus and possibly other coral reef fish species.","[Hepburn, R.

Both these phylogenetic events occurred well after the formation of the two barriers that currently separate those three allopatric populations.

These results are consistent with mtDNA surveys of four additional Hawaiian reef fauna in which a wide-spread Indo-Pacific species exhibited genetic homogeneity across the archipelago, while three endemics had significant population subdivision over the same range.

These species vary in both feeding morphology and behaviour, but the vast majority of species leave distinctive scars on the substratum when feeding. Although the role of parrotfishes in reef resilience is well documented, the basis of this role and the effect of their grazing scars on the benthic community structure remain unclear. This study evaluated the dynamics of grazing scars of large adult Scarus rivulatus and Chlorurus microrhinos on an inshore reef in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). These species represent the most abundant scraping and excavating parrotfish species on inshore reefs. Grazing scars of each species were marked, measured and observed for seven consecutive days. S. rivulatus grazing scars were smaller in area and volume and more rapidly reoccupied by algae than those of C. microrhinos. However, because of the higher abundance and feeding frequency of S. rivulatus at the study site, this species had higher algal removal rates than C. microrhinos. These species appear to play distinctly different functional roles in shaping the benthic community of inshore GBRs. S. rivulatus is primarily responsible for algal dynamics dominated by vegetative regrowth. In contrast, C. microrhinos opens relatively large areas which remain clear for several days. These scars may represent settlement sites which are relatively free from algae and sediment. This study provides new information on the differences between scraping and excavating parrotfishes and, in a system with just one abundant large excavating species, emphasizes the potential for low functional redundancy in high diversity coral reef systems.","[Bonaldo, Roberta Martini; Bellwood, David R.] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Bonaldo, Roberta Martini; Bellwood, David R.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",29,10.1007/s00227-009-1129-x,2009

Larval clownfish reared in control sea-water (pH 8.15) discriminated between a range of cues that could help them locate reef habitat and suitable settlement sites. This discriminatory ability was disrupted when larvae were reared in conditions simulating CO2-induced ocean acidification. Larvae became strongly attracted to olfactory stimuli they normally avoided when reared at levels of ocean pH that could occur ca. 2100 (pH 7.8) and they no longer responded to any olfactory cues when reared at pH levels (pH 7.6) that might be attained later next century on a business-as-usual carbon-dioxide emissions trajectory.

The results highlighted two different patterns of genetic variation, a weak genetic structure in A. minuta and population subdivision in G. niger. These observations may be explained not only in terms of the different dispersal capabilities of these species, but also considering that A. minuta is an abbreviate iteroparous spawner while G. niger is a protracted iteroparous spawner. Because abbreviate iteroparity is a reproductive strategy selected in stable environments with high resource availability, Pliocene and Pleistocene climate oscillations may have represented factors that negatively influenced the reproductive success of A. minuta, producing demographic fluctuations and bottlenecks, as suggested by the mismatch distribution analysis. The weak genetic structure of A. minuta populations seems to be therefore due to a more recent re-colonization of the Mediterranean basin after a severe population decline, rather than to the high vagility of this pelagic goby.","[Giovannotti, Massimo; Caputo, Vincenzo] Univ Politecn Marche, Ist Biol & Genet, I-60131 Ancona, Italy; [La Mesa, Mario] ISMAR CNR, Ist Sci Marine, Sez Ancona, I-60125 Ancona, Italy",8,10.1007/s00227-008-1078-9,2009

We sampled pre-settlement larvae and newly settled recruits from four reefs (two reserves and two non-reserves) in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, USA. Replicate point measures of larval supply over 14 months and 17 monthly measurements of recruitment varied significantly among months and sites. Sites with the same protection level had significantly different patterns of larval supply as well as larval and recruit diversity, but recruitment magnitude differed only by protection level, where densities were greater at reserves. Differences in larval supply among sites included two particularly large peaks in larval abundance at one site, possibly associated with the observed passage of small-scale oceanographic features. To examine whether relationships between larval supply and recruitment varied by protection level, we selected one species that was present in both the light trap samples and the monthly recruitment surveys. Recruitment of the bicolor damselfish Stegastes partitus was significantly and positively related to larval supply at three of the four sites thus, protection level did not influence this linkage.

We examined the trophic ecology of five common, small-bodied coral reef fish from the family Gobiidae. For each species, we determined diet composition, feeding bite rate, foraging substrate, and feeding behaviour, and examined whether diet composition and feeding bite rate changed ontogenetically and seasonally. The five species showed a diverse range of trophic modes: Amblygobius bynoensis and Amblygobius phalaena were herbivores, Valenciennea muralis was a carnivore, Asterropteryx semipunctatus a detritivore, and Istigobius goldmanni an omnivore. Both the herbivores and detritivore supplemented their diet with animal material. The consumption of a wide range of dietary resources by the two smallest species with the most restricted mobility (A. semipunctatus and I. goldmanni) may ensure energy requirements are met within a restricted foraging area. There was a significant difference in mean feeding bite rate among species, with carnivore > herbivore > omnivore > detritivore. None of the species exhibited an ontogenetic shift in diet composition or increase in feeding bite rate, indicating that (1) postmaturation growth is not facilitated by a higher quality diet or increased feeding intensity following maturation, and (2) their small body size does not preclude herbivory.

It was hypothesized that the temperate damselfish Parma microlepis, which produces benthic eggs and has limited post-settlement dispersal, would exhibit spatial genetic structure and a significant pattern of isolation-by-distance (IBD). A fully nested hierarchical sampling design incorporating three spatial scales (sites, location and regions, separated by 1-2, 10-50 and 70-80 km respectively) was used to determine genetic variability at seven microsatellite loci. Broad-scale genetic homogeneity and lack of IBD was well supported by single and multi-locus analyses. The proportion of the total genetic variation attributable to differences among regions, locations or sites was effectively zero (I broken vertical bar/R-statistics a parts per thousand currency sign0.007). The geographic distribution of genetic diversity and levels of polymorphism (H (E) 0.21-0.95) indicate high mutation rates, large effective population sizes, and high rates of gene flow. Significant gene flow may be driven by factors influencing pre-settlement dispersal, including the East Australian Current (EAC) and habitat continuity. Genetic connectivity may not reflect demographically important connectivity, but does imply that P. microlepis populations are well connected from an evolutionary perspective. Total observed genetic diversity was accounted for within 1-2 km of reef and could be represented within small Marine Protected Areas. Reef fishes in NSW which have life histories similar to P. microlepis (e.g. pre-settlement durations a parts per thousand yen2 weeks) are also likely to exhibit genetic homogeneity. Genetic markers are, therefore, most likely to provide information on demographically relevant connectivity for species with lower dispersal capabilities, small population sizes, short life spans, and whose habitats are rare, or patchily distributed along-shore.","[Curley, Belinda G.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Gillings, Michael R.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia",12,10.1007/s00227-008-1090-0,2009

The aims of the present study were to clarify the seasonality and lunar periodicity of the larval settlement, and the microhabitat association of newly settled juveniles for Lutjanus gibbus in an Okinawan coral reef. Fifteen coral patches were chosen and underwater visual surveys were conducted during a 2-year period. The larval settlement of the species mainly occurred between May and October during the 2-year survey period. In terms of lunar periodicity of the settlement, the newly settled juveniles were mainly found between the last quarter moon and new moon during the main settlement season. Back calculations of settlement dates based on otolith microstructure showed that most juveniles settled during the last quarter moon and new moon. Stepwise multiple regression analyses revealed that the newly settled juveniles were mainly found on coral patches with a large number of holes on the top of the coral patch and this tendency was mainly consistent during the study period. The volume of holes at the base of coral patches had also a positive effect on the abundance of newly settled juveniles in some cases. The results of the present study suggest that larval settlement has a strong seasonal and lunar periodicity, and newly settled juveniles select coral patches with available refuge spaces.","[Nanami, Atsushi; Yamada, Hideaki] Seikai Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Ishigaki Trop Stn, Fisheries Res Agcy, Fukai Ota 148 446, Okinawa 9070451, Japan; [Nanami, Atsushi; Yamada, Hideaki] Fisheries Res Agcy, Seikai Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Ishigaki Trop Stn, Okinawa 9070451, Japan",8,10.1007/s00227-008-1093-x,2009

However, the sensory mechanisms used to find settlement sites are poorly understood. One hypothesis is that larvae use olfactory cues to navigate home or find other suitable reef habitats. Here we show a strong association between the clownfish Amphiprion percula and coral reefs surrounding offshore islands in Papua New Guinea. Host anemones and A. percula are particularly abundant in shallow water beneath overhanging rainforest vegetation. A series of experiments were carried out using paired-choice flumes to evaluate the potential role of water-borne olfactory cues in finding islands. Recently settled A. percula exhibited strong preferences for: (i) water from reefs with islands over water from reefs without islands; (ii) water collected near islands over water collected offshore; and (iii) water treated with either anemones or leaves from rainforest vegetation. Laboratory reared-juveniles exhibited the same positive response to anemones and rainforest vegetation, suggesting that olfactory preferences are innate rather than learned. We hypothesize that A. percula use a suite of olfactory stimuli to locate vegetated islands, which may explain the high levels of self-recruitment on island reefs. This previously unrecognized link between coral reefs and island vegetation argues for the integrated management of these pristine tropical habitats.","[Dixson, Danielle L.; Jones, Geoffrey P.; Munday, Philip L.; Srinivasan, Maya; Syms, Craig] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Dixson, Danielle L.; Jones, Geoffrey P.; Munday, Philip L.; Pratchett, Morgan S.; Srinivasan, Maya] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Planes, Serge] Univ Perpignan, CNRS, UPVD, EPHE,Lab Ecosyst Aquat Trop & Mediterraneens,UMR, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Thorrold, Simon R.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Biol Dept MS 50, Woods Hole, MA USA",92,10.1098/rspb.2008.0876,2008

This has been one of the most oft-cited examples of a phase shift occurring on a coral reef. After decades of relatively constant, high abundance of the alga, percent cover declined dramatically throughout the bay between February and June 2006. The sudden decrease in cover of this alga appears to be the result of an unusually protracted cloudy, rainy period in March 2006, which may have reduced irradiance and caused the alga to lose weight. Corals and red macroalgae living at the same depths and in some of the same habitats were apparently not affected by this 42-day period of rain and overcast skies. Competition between corals and D. cavernosa for space on reef slopes has been virtually eliminated by the death of this alga, but the unstable rubble formations, which remain in much of the area formerly covered by D. cavernosa may not be conducive to rapid increase in cover by the remaining corals or to establishment by coral recruits. Two years later, there was still no recovery of D. cavernosa. This represents a rare example of decline in macroalgal dominance on a reef and a partial reversal, possibly only temporary, of a phase shift.","[Stimson, J.; Conklin, E.] Univ Hawaii, Dept Zool, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",12,10.1007/s00338-008-0409-0,2008

Therefore, predictions made with respect to climate change impacts on coral reefs need to be highly defensible to ensure credibility over the timeframes this issue demands. If not, a Cassandra syndrome could be created whereby future more well-supported predictions of the fate of reefs are neither heard nor acted upon. Herein, popularising predictions based on essentially untested assumptions regarding reefs and their capacity to cope with future climate change is questioned. Some of these assumptions include that: all corals live close to their thermal limits, corals cannot adapt/acclimatize to rapid rates of change, physiological trade-offs resulting from ocean acidification will lead to reduced fecundity, and that climate-induced coral loss leads to widespread fisheries collapse. We argue that, while there is a place for popularising worst-case scenarios, the coral reef crisis has been effectively communicated and, though this communication should be sustained, efforts should now focus on addressing critical knowledge gaps.","[Maynard, J.

The Caribbean gorgonian Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae has been harvested in the Bahamas for over a decade. Data on population age structure and growth rates in conjunction with harvest data provide an opportunity to compare fishery practices and outcomes to those suggested by a Beverton-Holt fishery model. The model suggests a minimum colony size limit of 7-9 years of age (21-28 cm height), which would allow each colony 2-4 years of reproduction prior to harvesting. The Beverton-Holt model assumes that colonies at or above the minimum size limit are completely removed. In the P. elisabethae fishery, colonies are partially clipped and can be repeatedly harvested. Linear growth of surviving colonies was up to 3 times that predicted for colonies that were not harvested and biomass increase was up to 9 times greater than that predicted for undisturbed colonies. The survival of harvested colonies and compensatory growth increases yield, and yields at sites that had previously been harvested were generally greater than predicted by the Beverton-Holt model. The model also assumes recruitment is independent of fishing intensity, but lower numbers of young colonies in the fished populations, compared to unfished populations, suggest possible negative effects of the harvest on reproduction. This suggests the need for longer intervals between harvests. Because it can be developed from data that can be collected at a single time, the Beverton-Holt model provides a rational starting point for regulating new fisheries where long-term characterizations of population dynamics are rarely available. However, an adaptive approach to the fishery requires the incorporation of reproductive data.","[Lasker, H.

River-reef connectivity, or source-sink dynamics of terrestrial runoff was further assessed from more than 400 watersheds of the region onto discrete coral reef areas. Using land use for 2003 and 2004 in the MAR, this work builds upon a Regional Ocean Modeling System simulation of the MAR validated by ocean color satellite data, and on the monthly river nutrient and sediment load and discharge provided by the World Resources Institute using the N-SPECT model. Analysis of the variability of simulated runoff transport to the reefs showed that reefs of the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (MBRS) were mostly impacted from June to September, following the peak time of river discharge. At that time, the coastal and oceanic circulations contribute quickly to expel the runoff from the MBRS. High runoff concentration waters leaving the eastern coast of Honduras during the months of October to December return to the southwestern MAR in March as they are entrained in a cyclonic gyre. Coral reefs of the MAR are thus impacted twice, first from the coastal side with runoff of local origin and later from the oceanic side with runoff from mixed origin. High probability of connectivity between rivers and remote reefs is established as this study revealed that river runoff from the north shore of Honduras has a wide-spread impact on most of the coral reefs of southern Belize, while watersheds on the Gulf of Honduras are mostly connected to coral reefs in the northern shore of Honduras. Although the level of remote influence (or runoff concentration reaching the reef) is lower than the local, the cumulative effect of numerous remote river-reef connections remains significant.","[Paris, C.

The environmental conditions at one site were highly variable spatially and temporally, but varied little at the other. In spite of these differences, MRT models revealed that identical forcing factors influenced the structure of larval fish assemblages at both sites, with a similar hierarchy, but a different statistical efficiency. At a large spatial scale, the seasonal variabilities in sun hours and wind (speed and/or direction) explained 14% and 64% of the structure of larval fish assemblages at the sites of high and low variability, respectively. At a small spatial scale, the seasonal variability in mean surface water temperature, followed by the concentration in Chl a, explained 22% and 62% of the structure of assemblages at the sites of high and low variability, respectively. The Dufrane-Legendre index matched characteristic families of larvae to each set of environmental conditions, and illustrated the role of sheltered, Chl a enriched, coastal waters in producing a families-rich assemblage of fish larvae, some species of which are targeted by fishing.

Both temperature and food supply affected the growth of juvenile and adult A. polyacanthus. Individuals grew more on high food rations, but growth declined with increasing temperature. Importantly, at 31 degrees C, the growth of juveniles and adults on the high food ration was nearly identical to growth on the low food ration.

Analyses of species numbers and total cover showed that site-to-site differences were generally very much greater than differences among times within sites. There were no significant differences among different geographical areas within the reef tract (Upper, Middle and Lower Keys). Large-scale changes documented included a reduction in species numbers and total cover on both deep and shallow offshore reefs between 1997 and 1999 followed by no recovery in cover, and only scant evidence of any recovery in species numbers by 2003. These changes coincided with bleaching events in 1997 and 1998, and the passage of Hurricane Georges through the Lower Keys in 1998. The lack of recovery among offshore reefs suggests that they were no longer resilient. Multivariate analyses revealed that some sites showed relatively little temporal variation in community composition, essentially random in direction, while others showed relatively large year-on-year changes. There was little evidence of any major region-wide changes affecting assemblage composition, or of any events that had impacted all of the sampling sites in any single year. Instead, different sites exhibited differing patterns of temporal variation, with certain sites displaying greater variation than others. Changes in community composition at some sites are interpreted in the light of knowledge of events at those sites and the relative sensitivities of species to various stressors, such as changes in cover of Acropora palmata and Millepora complanata at Sand Key following the bleaching events and hurricane in 1998, and declines in Montastraea annularis at Smith Shoal following a harmful algal bloom in 2002.

Increasingly, these fish are being targeted by fishermen, and resultant declines in biomass and abundance may have severe consequences for the dynamics and regeneration of coral reefs. However, the impact of overfishing extends beyond declining fish stocks. It can also lead to demographic changes within species populations where mean body size is reduced. The effect of reduced mean body size on population dynamics is well described in literature but virtually no information exists on how this may influence important ecological functions. The study investigated how one important function, scraping (i.e., the capacity to remove algae and open up bare substratum for coral larval settlement), by three common species of parrotfishes (Scarus niger, Chlorurus sordidus, and Chlorurus strongylocephalus) on coral reefs at Zanzibar (Tanzania) was influenced by the size of individual fishes. There was a non-linear relationship between body size and scraping function for all species examined, and impact through scraping was also found to increase markedly when fish reached a size of 15-20 cm. Thus, coral reefs which have a high abundance and biomass of parrotfish may nonetheless be functionally impaired if dominated by small-sized individuals. Reductions in mean body size within parrotfish populations could, therefore, have functional impacts on coral reefs that previously have been overlooked.","Stockholm Resilience Ctr Stockholm Univ 106 91 St, Stockholm, Sweden; [Lokrantz, J.; Nystrom, M.; Thyresson, M.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Syst Ecol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Lokrantz, J.; Nystrom, M.; Thyresson, M.] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Johansson, C.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia",79,10.1007/s00338-008-0394-3,2008

This property was investigated using high-resolution terrain models built using bathymetric LiDAR soundings of the shallow Puerto Rico insular shelf. A computer-simulation model constructed using simple random processes was adequate to describe many of the intricacies of actual coral reef terrain. This model, based on fractional Brownian motion (fBm), produced surfaces that were visually and statistically indistinguishable from natural seabeds, at spatial scales of 0.001-25 km2. The conformity between model and nature allowed us to ascertain the importance of topography as a driver for the fractal patchiness that has been shown to occur in plan-view maps of reefscapes (e.g. Purkis et al. J Sediment Res 75:861-876, 2005, J Geol 115:493-508, 2007).

Tissue reduction resulted in the formation of small ""reduction bodies"" tightly attached to the sponge skeleton. Although volume loss and gain were substantial, both tissue reduction and regeneration were often remarkably rapid, occurring within few hours. Microscopic analysis of the reduction bodies revealed morphological similarities to previously described sponge primmorphs, with densely packed archaeocytes and spherulous cells enclosed by a thin layer of epithelial-like cells. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) revealed pronounced changes in the sponge-associated microbial community upon tissue reduction during laboratory and field experiments and following changes in ambient conditions after transplantation in the field. Generally, the microbial community associated with this sponge proved less stable, less abundant, and less diverse than those of other, previously investigated Verongid sponges. However, one single phylotype was consistently present in DGGE profiles of Aplysinella sp. This phylotype clustered with gamma-proteobacterial sequences found previously in other sponge species of different taxonomic affiliations and geographic provenances, as well as in sponge larvae. No apparent changes in the total secondary metabolite content (per dry weight) occurred in Aplysinella sp. upon tissue reduction; however, comparative analysis of intact and reduced tissue suggested changes in the concentrations of two minor compounds. Besides being ecologically interesting, the tissue reduction phenomenon in Aplysinella sp. provides an experimentally manipulable system for studies on sponge/microbe symbioses.

In addition, acidification is likely to affect the relationship between corals and their symbiotic dinoflagellates and the productivity of this association. However, little is known about how acidification impacts on the physiology of reef builders and how acidification interacts with warming. Here, we report on an 8-week study that compared bleaching, productivity, and calcification responses of crustose coralline algae (CCA) and branching (Acropora) and massive (Porites) coral species in response to acidification and warming. Using a 30-tank experimental system, we manipulated CO2 levels to simulate doubling and three- to fourfold increases [intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projection categories IV and VI] relative to present-day levels under cool and warm scenarios. Results indicated that high CO2 is a bleaching agent for corals and CCA under high irradiance, acting synergistically with warming to lower thermal bleaching thresholds. We propose that CO2. induces bleaching via its impact on photoprotective mechanisms of the photosystems. Overall, acidification impacted more strongly on bleaching and productivity than on calcification. Interestingly, the intermediate, warm CO2 scenario led to a 30% increase in productivity in Acropora, whereas high CO2 lead to zero productivity in both corals. CCA were most sensitive to acidification, with high CO2 leading to negative productivity and high rates of net dissolution. Our findings suggest that sensitive reef-building species such as CCA may be pushed beyond their thresholds for growth and survival within the next few decades whereas corals will show delayed and mixed responses.","[Anthony, K.

In order to establish the perceived scale of decline, identify perceptions of its causes and potential remedies, and views on past, present and future management strategies, this paper employed a discourse analysis of interview transcripts from primary and key stakeholders. This illustrated that most stakeholders recognised the decline but felt powerless to take the necessary steps to reverse it. The Utilian market-oriented mode of fisheries governance was perceived to have exacerbated the decline, and subsequently, it appeared that two modes of fisheries governance were implicitly endorsed: (1) voluntary authoritarianism and (2) community co-management. This paper concludes that voluntary authoritarianism is more likely to succeed in curbing the unprecedented Utilian commercial fish stock decline in the short-term, in preparation for community co-management, a more permanent and sustainable solution. Based on the above, the paper advises caution with regards to allowing market forces to determine how fisheries are governed, and emphasises the need for enforcing strict regulations on fisheries before contemplating a transition to a more participative mode of fisheries governance.

Bottom-up effects of prey (primary producer) biodiversity are also well known. However, the role of consumer diversity in affecting community structure or ecosystem function is not well understood. Here, we show that herbivore species richness can be critical for maintaining the structure and function of coral reefs. In two experiments over 2 years, we constructed large cages enclosing single herbivore species, equal densities of mixed species of herbivores, or excluding herbivores and assessed effects on both seaweeds and corals. When compared with sing le-herbivore treatments, mixed-herbivore treatments lowered macroalgal abundance by 54-76%, enhanced cover of crustose coralline algae (preferred recruitment sites for corals) by 52-64%, increased coral cover by 22%, and prevented coral mortality. Complementary feeding by herbivorous fishes drove the herbivore richness effects, because macroalgae were unable to effectively deter fishes with different feeding strategies. Maintaining herbivore species richness appears critical for preserving coral reefs, because complementary feeding by diverse herbivores produces positive, but indirect, effects on corals, the foundation species for the ecosystem.","[Burkepile, Deron E.; Hay, Mark E.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",214,10.1073/pnas.0801946105,2008

Reef corals that brood their larvae internally and release mature larvae are believed to show little exchange of larvae over ecological times scales and are therefore expected to recover extremely slowly from large-scale perturbations. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using analysis of ten DNA microsatellite loci, we show that although Great Barrier Reef (GBR) populations of the brooding coral, Seriatopora hystrix, are mostly self-seeded and some populations are highly isolated, a considerable amount of sexual larvae (up to similar to 4%) has been exchanged among several reefs 10 s to 100 s km apart over the past few generations. Our results further indicate that S. hystrix is capable of producing asexual propagules with similar long-distance dispersal abilities (similar to 1.4% of the sampled colonies had a multilocus genotype that also occurred at another sampling location), which may aid in recovery from environmental disturbances. Conclusions/Significance: Patterns of connectivity in this and probably other GBR corals are complex and need to be resolved in greater detail through genetic characterisation of different cohorts and linkage of genetic data with fine-scale hydrodynamic models.","[van Oppen, Madeleine J.

With improving resolution of their phylogenetic relationships, the many cichlid fish species endemic to the African Great Lakes Malawi, Tanganyika, and Victoria provide a significant resource for the comparative study of such evolutionary processes. Here, we show that cichlid lineages colonizing rocky shores and pelagic habitats in the different lakes have independently evolved larger eggs and lower fecundities than benthic lineages, suggesting parallel adaptive life-history evolution. By contrast, other pelagic teleost fishes in both marine and freshwater habitats, including African lakes, typically produce large numbers of very small eggs.

The experiment was conducted in replicate continuous flow coral reef mesocosms flushed with unfiltered sea water from Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii. Mesocosms were located in full sunlight and experienced diurnal and seasonal fluctuations in temperature and sea water chemistry characteristic of the adjacent reef flat. Treatment mesocosms were manipulated to simulate an increase in pCO(2) to levels expected in this century [midday pCO(2) levels exceeding control mesocosms by 365 +/- 130 mu atm (mean +/- sd)]. Acidification had a profound impact on the development and growth of crustose coralline algae (CCA) populations. During the experiment, CCA developed 25% cover in the control mesocosms and only 4% in the acidified mesocosms, representing an 86% relative reduction. Free-living associations of CCA known as rhodoliths living in the control mesocosms grew at a rate of 0.6 g buoyant weight year(-1) while those in the acidified experimental treatment decreased in weight at a rate of 0.9 g buoyant weight year(-1), representing a 250% difference. CCA play an important role in the growth and stabilization of carbonate reefs, so future changes of this magnitude could greatly impact coral reefs throughout the world. Coral calcification decreased between 15% and 20% under acidified conditions. Linear extension decreased by 14% under acidified conditions in one experiment. Larvae of the coral Pocillopora damicornis were able to recruit under the acidified conditions. In addition, there was no significant difference in production of gametes by the coral Montipora capitata after 6 months of exposure to the treatments.","[Jokiel, P. L.; Rodgers, K. S.; Cox, E.

Despite this, few estimates of larval survival are available. For scleractinian corals, few studies of larval survival are long enough to provide accurate estimates of longevity. Moreover, changes in mortality rates during larval life, expected on theoretical grounds, have implications for the degree of connectivity among reefs and have not been quantified for any coral species. This study quantified the survival of larvae from five broadcast-spawning scleractinian corals (Acropora latistella, Favia pallida, Pectinia paeonia, Goniastrea aspera, and Montastraea magnistellata) to estimate larval longevity, and to test for changes in mortality rates as larvae age. Maximum lifespans ranged from 195 to 244 d. These longevities substantially exceed those documented previously for coral larvae that lack zooxanthellae, and they exceed predictions based on metabolic rates prevailing early in larval life. In addition, larval mortality rates exhibited strong patterns of variation throughout the larval stage. Three periods were identified in four species: high initial rates of mortality; followed by a low, approximately constant rate of mortality; and finally, progressively increasing mortality after approximately 100 d. The lifetimes observed in this study suggest that the potential for long-distance dispersal may be substantially greater than previously thought. Indeed, detection of increasing mortality rates late in life suggests that energy reserves do not reach critically low levels until approximately 100 d after spawning. Conversely, increased mortality rates early in life decrease the likelihood that larvae transported away from their natal reef will survive to reach nearby reefs, and thus decrease connectivity at regional scales. These results show how variation in larval survivorship with age may help to explain the seeming paradox of high genetic structure at metapopulation scales, coupled with the maintenance of extensive geographic ranges observed in many coral species.","[Graham, E.

This study compared distribution patterns and habitat associations of juvenile (young of the year) butterflyfishes to those of adult conspecifics. Three species, Chaetodon auriga, Chaetodon melannotus, and Chaetodon vagabundus, all of which have limited reliance on coral for food, exhibited marked differences in habitat association of juvenile versus adult individuals. Juveniles of these species were consistently found in shallow-water habitats, whereas adult conspecifics were widely distributed throughout a range of habitats. Juveniles of seven other species (Chaetodon aureofasciatus, Chaetodon baronessa, Chaetodon citrinellus, Chaetodon lunulatus, Chaetodon plebeius, Chaetodon rainfordi, and Chaetodon trifascialis), all of which feed predominantly on live corals, settled directly into habitat occupied by adult conspecifics. Butterflyfishes with strong reliance on corals appear to be constrained to settle in habitats that provide access to essential prey resources, precluding their use of distinct juvenile habitats. More generalist butterflyfishes, however, appear to utilize distinct juvenile habitats and exhibit marked differences in the distribution of juveniles versus adults.","[Pratchett, M. S.; Marnane, M.

VLPs were present in all coral colonies sampled at Heron Island (southern GBR) and in tagged coral colonies sampled in at least two of the three sampling periods at Lizard Island (northern GBR). VLPs were observed within gastrodermal and epidermal tissues, and on rarer occasions, within the mesoglea. These VLPs had similar morphologies to known prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses in other systems. Icosahedral VLPs were observed most frequently, however, filamentous VLPs (FVLPs) and phage were also noted. There were no clear differences in VLP size, morphology or location within the tissues with respect to sample date, coral health status or site. The most common VLP morphotype exhibited icosahedral symmetry, 120-150 nm in diameter, with an electron-dense core and an electronlucent membrane. Larger VLPs of similar morphology were also common. VLPs occurred as single entities, in groups, or in dense clusters, either as free particles within coral tissues, or within membrane-bound vacuoles. VLPs were commonly observed within the perinuclear region, with mitochondria, golgi apparatus and crescent-shaped particles frequently observed within close proximity. The host(s) of these observed VLPs was not clear; however, the different sizes and morphologies of VLPs observed within A. muricata tissues suggest that viruses are infecting either the coral animal, zooxanthellae, intracellular bacteria and/or other coral-associated microbiota, or that the one host is susceptible to infection from more than one type of virus. These results add to the limited but emerging body of evidence that viruses represent another potentially important component of the coral holobiont.","[Patten, N. L.; Mitchell, J.

Understanding and quantifying the impact of herbivores in ecosystems are fundamental to our ability to manage these systems. The traditional method of quantifying the impact of herbivorous fishes on coral reefs has been to use transplanted pieces of seagrass or algae as ""bioassays"". However, these experiments leave a key question unanswered, namely: Which species are responsible for the impact being quantified? This study revisits the use of bioassays and tested the assumption that the visual abundance of species reflects their role in the removal of assay material. Using remote video cameras to film removal of assay material on an inner-shelf reef of the Great Barrier Reef, the species responsible for assay-based herbivory were identified. The video footage revealed that Siganus canaliculatus, a species not previously recorded at the study site, was primarily responsible for removal of macroalgal biomass. The average percentage decrease in thallus length of whole plants of Sargassum at the reef crest was 54 +/- 8.9% (mean +/- SE), and 50.4 +/- 9.8% for individually presented Sargassum strands (for a 4.5-h deployment). Of the 14,656 bites taken from Sargassum plants and strands across all reef zones, nearly half (6,784 bites or 46%) were taken by S. canaliculatus, with the majority of the remainder attributable to Siganus doliatus. However, multiple regression analysis demonstrated that only the bites of S. canaliculatus were removing macroalgal biomass. The results indicate that, even with detailed observations, the species of herbivore that may be responsible for maintaining benthic community structure can go unnoticed. Some of our fundamental ideas of the relative importance of individual species in ecosystem processes may be in need of re-evaluation.","[Fox, R. J.; Bellwood, D.

The susceptibility to, and effect of reef-based micropredatory gnathiid isopods on larval, recently settled, and juvenile fishes was tested using two damselfishes (Pomacentridae): Neopomacentrus azysron, which has pelagic larvae, and Acanthochromis polyacanthus, which does not. When larval and recently settled stages of N. azysron and very young A. polyacanthus juveniles (smaller than larval N. azysron) were exposed to one or three gnathiids, the proportion of infections did not vary significantly among the three host types or between the number of gnathiids to which the fish were exposed. The overall infection was 35%. Mortality, however, differed among the three gnathiid-exposed host types with most deaths occurring in larval N. azysron; no mortalities occurred for recently settled N. azysron exposed to one or three gnathiids, and A. polyacanthus exposed to one gnathiid. Mortality did not differ significantly between larval N. azysron and A. polyacanthus juveniles, failing to provide support for the hypothesis that reef-based A. polyacanthus juveniles are better adapted to gnathiid attack than fish with a pelagic phase.

Little, however, is known about these early interactions. The cymothoid isopod, Anilocra apogonae, infests the definitive host, Cheilodipterus quinquelineatus. This study examined their host preference among potential optional intermediate hosts. Their effect on the growth and mortality of the young of three apogonid fishes, including the definitive host, was investigated. The number of mancae produced per brood was positively correlated with female length. When given a choice of intermediate hosts, significantly more mancae attached to Apogon trimaculatus (Apogonidae) than to Apogon nigrofasciatus. When presented with Ap. trimaculatus and Pomacentrus amboinensis (Pomacentridae), mancae only attached to Ap. trimaculatus suggesting that mancae may show a taxonomic affiliation with preferred hosts. Mancae fed on all three apogonid species, with C. quinquelineatus being fed on earlier than Ap. trimaculatus and Ap. nigrofasciatus. Mancae feeding frequency, adjusted for fish survival, was lowest on C. quinquelineatus and highest on Ap. trimaculatus. Infested apogonids had reduced growth and increased mortality compared with uninfested fish. A. apogonae mancae can use several species of young apogonid fishes as optional intermediate hosts. Via reduced growth and increased mortality, mancae have the potential to negatively influence definitive host populations and also other young species of apogonid fishes.","[Fogelman, R.

While the contribution of a warming climate to the loss of live coral cover has been well documented across large spatial and temporal scales, the associated effects on fish have not. Here, we respond to recent and repeated calls to assess the importance of local management in conserving coral reefs in the context of global climate change. Such information is important, as coral reef fish assemblages are the most species dense vertebrate communities on earth, contributing critical ecosystem functions and providing crucial ecosystem services to human societies in tropical countries. Our assessment of the impacts of the 1998 mass bleaching event on coral cover, reef structural complexity, and reef associated fishes spans 7 countries, 66 sites and 26 degrees of latitude in the Indian Ocean. Using Bayesian meta-analysis we show that changes in the size structure, diversity and trophic composition of the reef fish community have followed coral declines. Although the ocean scale integrity of these coral reef ecosystems has been lost, it is positive to see the effects are spatially variable at multiple scales, with impacts and vulnerability affected by geography but not management regime. Existing no-take marine protected areas still support high biomass of fish, however they had no positive affect on the ecosystem response to large-scale disturbance. This suggests a need for future conservation and management efforts to identify and protect regional refugia, which should be integrated into existing management frameworks and combined with policies to improve system-wide resilience to climate variation and change.","[Graham, Nicholas A.

1426,"Work, Thierry M.; Aeby, Greta S.; Maragos, James E.",Phase Shift from a Coral to a Corallimorph-Dominated Reef Associated with a Shipwreck on Palmyra Atoll,PLOS ONE,,"Coral reefs can undergo relatively rapid changes in the dominant biota, a phenomenon referred to as phase shift. Various reasons have been proposed to explain this phenomenon including increased human disturbance, pollution, or changes in coral reef biota that serve a major ecological function such as depletion of grazers. However, pinpointing the actual factors potentially responsible can be problematic. Here we show a phase shift from coral to the corallimorpharian Rhodactis howesii associated with a long line vessel that wrecked in 1991 on an isolated atoll (Palmyra) in the central Pacific Ocean. We documented high densities of R. howesii near the ship that progressively decreased with distance from the ship whereas R. howesii were rare to absent in other parts of the atoll. We also confirmed high densities of R. howesii around several buoys recently installed on the atoll in 2001. This is the first time that a phase shift on a coral reef has been unambiguously associated with man-made structures. This association was made, in part, because of the remoteness of Palmyra and its recent history of minimal human habitation or impact. Phase shifts can have long-term negative ramification for coral reefs, and eradication of organisms responsible for phase shifts in marine ecosystems can be difficult, particularly if such organisms cover a large area. The extensive R. howesii invasion and subsequent loss of coral reef habitat at Palmyra also highlights the importance of rapid removal of shipwrecks on corals reefs to mitigate the potential of reef overgrowth by invasives.","[Work, Thierry M.] US Geol Survey, Natl Wildlife Hlth Ctr, Honolulu Field Stn, Honolulu, HI USA; [Aeby, Greta S.] Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Maragos, James E.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Pacific Isl Refuges, Honolulu, HI USA",40,10.1371/journal.pone.0002989,2008

The giant barrel sponge Xestospongia muta dominates Caribbean coral reef communities, where it is an important spatial competitor, increases habitat complexity, and filters seawater. It has been called the 'redwood of the reef' because of its size (often > 1 m height and diameter) and presumed long life, but very little is known about its demography. Since 1997, we have established and monitored 12 permanent 16 m diameter circular transects on the reef slope off Key Largo, Florida, to study this important species. Over a 4.5-year interval, we measured the volume of 104 tagged sponges using digital images to determine growth rates of X. muta. Five models were fit to the cubed root of initial and final volume estimates to determine which best described growth. Additional measurements of 33 sponges were taken over 6-month intervals to examine the relationship between the spongocoel, or inner-osculum space, and sponge size, and to examine short-term growth dynamics. Sponge volumes ranged from 24.05 to 80,281.67 cm(3). Growth was variable, and specific growth rates decreased with increasing sponge size. The mean specific growth rate was 0.52 +/- 0.65 year(-1), but sponges grew as fast or slow as 404 or 2% year(-1). Negative growth rates occurred over short temporal scales and growth varied seasonally, significantly faster during the summer. No differences in specific growth rate were found between transects at three different depths (15, 20, 30 m) or at two different reef sites. Spongocoel volume was positively allometric with increasing sponge size and scaling between the vertical and horizontal dimensions of the sponge indicated that morphology changes from a frustum of a cone to cylindrical as volume increases. Growth of X. muta was best described by the general von Bertalanffy and Tanaka growth curves. The largest sponge within our transects (1.23 x 0.98 m height x diameter) was estimated to be 127 years old. Although age extrapolations for very large sponges are subject to more error, the largest sponges on Caribbean reefs may be in excess of 2,300 years, placing X. muta among the longest-lived animals on earth.","[McMurray, S.

A key determinant of the fate of reef corals in a warming climate is their capacity to tolerate increasing thermal stress. Here, an increase in thermal tolerance is demonstrated for three major coral genera (Acropora, Pocillopora and Porites) following the extensive mass bleaching event that occurred on the Great Barrier Reef (Australia) in 1998. During the subsequent and more severe thermal stress event in 2002, bleaching severity was 30-100% lower than predicted from the relationship between severity and thermal stress in 1998, despite higher solar irradiances during the 2002 thermal event. Coral genera most susceptible to thermal stress (Pocillopora and Acropora) showed the greatest increase in tolerance. Although bleaching was severe in 1998, whole-colony mortality was low at most study sites. Therefore, observed increases in thermal tolerance cannot be explained by selective mortality alone, suggesting a capacity for acclimatization or adaptation. Although the vulnerability of coral reefs remains largely dependent on the rate and extent of climate change, such increase in thermal tolerance may delay the onset of mass coral mortalities in time for the implementation of low-emission scenarios and effective management.","[Maynard, J.

By using Stylophora pistillata as a model, we monitored individual tagged colonies in situ over a two-year period and show that fine level genetic variability within clade C is correlated to differences in bleaching susceptibility. Based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of the internal transcribed spacer region 2, visual bleaching assessments, symbiont densities, host protein, and pulse amplitude modulated fluorometry, we show that subcladal types C78 and C8/a are more thermally tolerant than C79 and C35/a, which suffered significant bleaching and postbleaching mortality. Although additional symbiont types were detected during bleaching in colonies harboring types C79 and C35/a, all colonies reverted back to their original symbionts postbleaching. Most importantly, the data propose that the differential mortality of hosts harboring thermally sensitive versus resistant symbionts rather than symbiont shuffling/switching within a single host is responsible for the observed symbiont composition changes of coral communities after bleaching. This study therefore highlights that the use of broad cladal designations may not be suitable to describe differences in bleaching susceptibility, and that differential mortality results in a loss of both symbiont and host genetic diversity and therefore represents an important mechanism in explaining how coral reef communities may respond to changing conditions.","[Sampayo, E.

Acidification is expected to reduce coral reef calcification and increase reef dissolution. Inorganic cementation in reefs describes the precipitation of CaCO3 that acts to bind framework components and occlude porosity. Little is known about the effects of ocean acidification on reef cementation and whether changes in cementation rates will affect reef resistance to erosion. Coral reefs of the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) are poorly developed and subject to rapid bioerosion. Upwelling processes mix cool, subthermocline waters with elevated pCO(2) (the partial pressure of CO2) and nutrients into the surface layers throughout the ETP. Concerns about ocean acidification have led to the suggestion that this region of naturally low pH waters may serve as a model of coral reef development in a high-CO2 world. We analyzed seawater chemistry and reef framework samples from multiple reef sites in the ETP and found that a low carbonate saturation state (Omega) and trace abundances of cement are characteristic of these reefs. These low cement abundances may be a factor in the high bioerosion rates previously reported for ETP reefs, although elevated nutrients in upwelled waters may also be limiting cementation and/or stimulating bioerosion. ETP reefs represent a real-world example of coral reef growth in low-Omega waters that provide insights into how the biological-geological interface of coral reef ecosystems will change in a high-CO2 world.","[Manzello, Derek P.] Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Manzello, Derek P.; Glynn, Peter W.; Langdon, Chris] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine Biol & Fisheries, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Kleypas, Joan A.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Inst Study Soc & Environm, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Budd, David A.] Univ Colorado, Dept Geol Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Eakin, C.

Specifically, the potentially irreparable damage to fisheries because of mangrove loss has been belittled and is greatly underestimated. Here, we show that, in the Gulf of California, fisheries landings are positively related to the local abundance of mangroves and, in particular, to the productive area in the mangrove-water fringe that is used as nursery and/or feeding grounds by many commercial species. Mangrove-related fish and crab species account for 32% of the small-scale fisheries landings in the region. The annual economic median value of these fisheries is US $37,500 per hectare of mangrove fringe, failing within the higher end of values previously calculated worldwide for all mangrove services together. The ten-year discounted value of one hectare of fringe is >300 times the official cost set by the Mexican government. The destruction of mangroves has a strong economic impact on local fishing communities and on food production in the region.

Coral-dinoflagellate symbioses are defined as mutualistic because both partners receive benefit from the association via the exchange of nutrients. This successful interaction underpins the growth and formation of coral reefs. The symbiotic dinoflagellate genus Symbiodinium is genetically diverse containing eight divergent lineages (clades A-H). Corals predominantly associate with clade C Symbiodinium and to a lesser extent with clades A, B, D, F, and G. Variation in the function and interactive physiology of different coral-dinoflagellate assemblages is virtually unexplored but is an important consideration when developing the contextual framework of factors that contribute to coral reef resilience. In this study, we present evidence that clade A Symbiodinium are functionally less beneficial to corals than the dominant clade C Symbiodinium and may represent parasitic rather than mutualistic symbionts. Our hypothesis is supported by (i) a significant correlation between the presence of Symbiodinium clade A and health-compromised coral; (it) a phylogeny and genetic diversity within Symbiodinium that suggests a different evolutionary trajectory for clade A compared with the other dominant Symbiodinium lineages; and (iii) a significantly lower amount of carbon fixed and released by clade A in the presence of a coral synthetic host factor as compared with the dominant coral symbiont lineage, clade C.

The lack of other Symbiodinium clades besides clade A in this study may be due to other clades not being readily culturable under culture conditions used here. The new isolates could be phylogenetically divided into four groups, though no sequences were identical to previously reported Symbiodinium. Two of the four groups were closely related to symbiotic Symbiodinium clade A isolated from a variety of host species. One isolate group formed a highly supported monophyly with Symbiodinium types that have previously been characterized as ""free-living"".

Infected colonies produced similar signs to those observed in the field following exposure to bacterial concentrations of 1x10(6) cells ml(-1). Phylogenetic 16S rRNA gene analysis demonstrated that all six pathogens identified in this study were members of the gamma-Proteobacteria family Vibrionacae, each with greater than 98% sequence identity with the previously characterized coral bleaching pathogen Vibrio coralliilyticus. Screening for proteolytic activity of more than 150 coral derived bacterial isolates by a biochemical assay and specific primers for a Vibrio family zinc-metalloprotease demonstrated a significant association between the presence of isolates capable of proteolytic activity and observed disease signs. Conclusion/Significance: This is the first study to provide evidence for the involvement of a unique taxonomic group of bacterial pathogens in the aetiology of Indo-Pacific coral diseases affecting multiple coral species at multiple locations.

Each potential benefit has a different set of predictors (relationships between aggregation and conspecific or predator densities), but conflicting results could suggest the simultaneous operation of more than one benefit. These predictions were tested for coexisting Panulirus guttatus (a reef-obligate) and Panulirus argus (a temporary reef-dweller) using data collected during 11 surveys on fixed sites over a coral reef in Mexico. P. guttatus greatly outnumbered P. argus, but P. argus showed a greater tendency to aggregate. All three benefits of den sharing operated for the more social P. argus, with ""group defense"" being of the most benefit for larger individuals, and the ""guide"" and ""dilution"" effects for smaller individuals recently immigrating into the reef habitat and sharing dens with larger conspecifics. P. guttatus did not display ""group defense"" and its aggregations appeared to be modulated by the interplay between attraction and aggressive behaviors. This species relied more on solitary crypticity, especially at larger sizes, but appeared to benefit from a ""guide effect"" at high conspecific densities. In experimental tanks, each species tended to aggregate when tested separately, but when tested jointly, aggregation among P. guttatus was significantly reduced. The experimental results reflect the differential patterns of aggregation between the fore-reef, where P. guttatus dominated, and the back-reef, where coexistence of both species was greater.","[Briones-Fourzan, P.; Lozano-Alvarez, E.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Unidad Acad Puerto Morelos, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Cancun 77500, QR, Mexico",17,10.1007/s00338-007-0322-y,2008

This study measured grazing activities of the pan Indo-Pacific parrotfish Scarus ghobban over short-term changes in temperature in upwelling and non-upwelling environments on the Pacific coast of Panama. Individual juvenile fish were followed over naturally varying temperatures to determine their bite rates (bites min(-1)), the foray frequency (forays min(-1)) and bites per foray. In the upwelling environment, there was a significant positive correlation between temperature and bite rate (R-Partial = 0.63, P < 0.0001) and there was a marked fourfold change in bite rates over the range of temperatures encountered in the study (21.2-29.4 degrees C).

Acanthurids contributed the greatest to catch volume, with bluespine unicornfish, Naso unicornis, and orangespine unicornfish, Naso lituratus, among the most frequently observed herbivores. Nighttime spearfishing was the dominant fishing method and inner lagoon areas were primarily targeted. A seasonal sales ban (March-April), intended to reduce pressure on reproductively active serranids, significantly increased the capture volume of other families. Catch was significantly greater during periods of low lunar illumination, suggesting higher fishing success or greater effort, or both. The marketed catch was dominated by juveniles and small adults, based on fishes of known size at sexual maturity. Artificially depressed market prices appear to be catalyzing (potential or realized) overfishing by increasing the volume of fish needed to offset rising fuel prices. These results support the need for comprehensive fisheries management that produces sustainable fishing and marketing practices and promotes shared management and enforced responsibilities between communities and the state. To be effective, management should prohibit nighttime spearfishing.","[Rhodes, K. L.] Univ Hawaii, Coll Agr Forestry & Nat Resource Management, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [Tupper, M.

In total, 170 individuals were sampled from 8 localities distributed between Taiwan and Japan, and 71 haplotypes were obtained through sequence alignment. High haplotype diversity (h = 0.956 +/- 0.008) with low nucleotide diversity (pi = 0.010 +/- 0.006) was observed, and the results of the mismatch distribution test suggested that a historical population expansion after a period of population bottleneck might have occurred among P. coelestis populations. Based on the results of the UPGMA tree and AMOVA (Phi ct = 0.193, P < 0.05) analyses, fish populations from eight localities could be divided into two groups: one includes populations from localities around mainland Japan, and the other includes those from Okinawa and southern Taiwan. A genetic break was found between populations from mainland Japan and Okinawa, and this break was congruent with the pattern of phenotypic variations documented in previous studies. This evidence supports the latitudinal variation of reproductive traits among P. coelestis populations likely being genetically based. It is suggested that the changes in sea level and sea surface temperatures during past glaciations might have resulted in population bottlenecks in P. coelestis and the modern populations in the northern West Pacific are likely the results of recolonization after such events. The Kuroshio Current acts not only as a vehicle for larval transport along its pathway (between populations in southern Taiwan and Okinawa) but also as a barrier for larval dispersal across the Kuroshio axis (between populations in mainland Japan and Okinawa).","[Liu, Shang-Yin V.; Dai, Chang-Feng] Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 10764, Taiwan; [Kokita, Tomoyuki] Fukui Prefectural Univ, Dept Marine Biosci, Fukui, Japan",20,10.1007/s00227-008-0967-2,2008

This transport from ocean spawning to freshwater, estuarine and coastal nursery areas is a combination of physical and biological processes (including swimming behavior). In New Jersey, USA, the American eel (Anguilla rostrata) enters estuaries as glass eels (48.7-68.1 mm TL) in contrast to the Conger eel (Conger oceanicus) that enters as larger (metamorphosing) leptocephali (68.3-117.8 mm TL). To begin to understand the mechanisms of cross-shelf transport for these species, we measured the potential swimming capability (critical swimming speed, U(crit)) under ambient conditions throughout the ingress season. A. rostrata glass eels were collected over many months (January-June) at a range of temperatures (4-21 degrees C), with relative condition declining over the course of the ingress period as temperatures warmed. C. oceanicus occurred later in the season (April-June) and at warmer temperatures (14-24.5 degrees C). Mean U(crit) values for A. rostrata (11.7-13.3 cm s(-1)) and C. oceanicus (14.7-18.6 cm s(-1)) were comparable, but variable, with portions of the variability explained by water temperature, relative condition, ontogenetic stage, and fish length. Travel times to Little Egg Inlet, New Jersey, estimated using 50% U(crit) values, indicate it would take A. rostrata similar to 30 and similar to 60 days to swim from the shelf edge and Gulf Stream, respectively. Travel times for C. oceanicus were shorter, similar to 20 days from the shelf edge, and similar to 45 days from the Gulf Stream. Despite differences in life stage, our results indicate both species are competent swimmers, and suggest they are capable of swimming from the Gulf Stream and/or edge of the continental shelf to estuarine inlets.","[Wuenschel, M.

Larvae were reared from broadcast spawned gametes of sexually reproductive male and female anemones collected from the Solitary Islands Marine Park, NSW, Australia. Prior to the start of the experiments, H. crispa larvae were reared for 3 days after spawning in March 2004 and E. quadricolor larvae were reared for 4 days after spawning in February 2005. Larval settlement onto biologically conditioned terracotta tiles in outdoor flow-through seawater aquaria was first recorded 4 days after spawning for H. crispa and 5 days after spawning for E. quadricolor. Peak settlement occurred 10 days after spawning, with a mean of 33.4 and 50.3% of the original groups of 350 larvae in replicate tanks settling for H. crispa and E. quadricolor, respectively. Tentacles arose as outpocketings of the oral region, at first appearing as small rounded buds. These buds elongated to form long, thin, tapering tentacles in H. crispa, whereas E. quadricolor tentacles had slight bulbs below the tips. Juvenile anemones, especially H. crispa, were found to have very different colouration and markings when compared with adult anemones, and therefore the descriptions and images provided here will enable correct identification of juvenile recruits.","[Scott, Anna; Harrison, Peter L.] So Cross Univ, Coral Reef Res Ctr, Sch Environm Sci & Management, Lismore, NSW 2480, Australia; [Scott, Anna] Natl Marine Sci Ctr, Coffs Harbour, NSW 2450, Australia",9,10.1007/s00227-008-0976-1,2008

We used a 5-year dataset (1996-2000) of macroalgal and sponge cover and water quality measurements as predictor variables of hard coral community structure in the FKNMS. The 16 water quality variables were summarized into 4 groups by principal component analysis (PCA). Hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis of the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the principal component scores of water quality variables separated the reef sites into two main groups (and five sub-groups), referred to as reefs of similar influence (RSI). The main groups corresponded with their geographical locations within the Florida Keys: the reefs in the Upper and Middle Keys being homogeneous and collectively, having lower water quality scores relative to reefs in the Lower Keys. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) between hard coral cover and key predictor variables (i.e., water quality, macroalgal cover and sponge cover) also separated the reefs in the Lower Keys from reefs in the Upper-Middle Keys, consistent with results of the cluster analysis, which categorized reefs based on RSI. These results suggest that the prevailing gradient of predictor variables may have influenced the structuring of coral reef communities at a spatial scale larger than the individual reef. Furthermore, it is conceivable that these predictor variables exerted influence for a long time rather than being a recent event. Results also revealed a pattern showing reduction in hard coral cover and species richness, and subsequent proliferation of macroalgae and sponges during the study period. Our analyses of the Florida Keys present a pattern that is consistent with the characteristics of a reef that has undergone a ""phase-shift,"" a phenomenon that is widely reported in the Caribbean region.","[Maliao, Ronald J.; Turingan, Ralph G.; Lin, Junda] Florida Inst Technol, Dept Biol Sci, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA",49,10.1007/s00227-008-0977-0,2008

We used the anemonefish symbiosis as a model system to create a balance sheet for nitrogen production and transfer within a three-way symbiotic system. We quantified diel patterns in excretion of ammonia by anemonefish and subsequent absorption by host sea anemones and zooxanthellae under laboratory conditions. Rates of ammonia excretion by the anemonefish Amphiprion bicinctus varied from a high of 1.84 mu mole g(-1) h(-1) at 2 h after feeding, to a basal rate of 0.50 mu mole g(-1) h(-1) at 24-36 h since the last meal. Conversely, host sea anemones Entacmaea quadricolor absorbed ammonia at a rate of 0.10 mu mole g(-1) h(-1) during the daytime in ammonia-enriched seawater, but during the night reduced their absorption rate to near zero, indicating that ammonia uptake was driven by zooxanthella photosynthesis. When incubated together, net ammonia excretion was virturally zero, indicating that host anemones absorbed most of the ammonia produced by resident fish. Adult anemonefish weighed about 11 g under laboratory conditions, but on the coral reef may reach up to 64 g, resulting in a maximal potential ammonia load of > 200 mu mole h(-1) produced by two adult fish during daylight hours. In contrast, host sea anemones weighed about 47 g in the laboratory, but under field conditions, large individuals may reach 680 g, so their maximal ammonia clearance rates may reach about 70 mu mole h(-1) during the daytime. As such, the ammonia load produced by adult anemonefish far exceeds the clearance rate of host anemones and zooxanthellae. Ammonia transfer likely occurs mainly during the daytime, when anemonefish consume zooplankton and excrete rapidly, and in turn the zooxanthellae are photosynthetically active and drive rapid ammonia uptake. We conclude that zooplanktivorous fishes that form mutualisms with coral reef cnidarians may serve as an important link between open water and benthic ecosystems, through the transfer of large quantities of nutrients to zooxanthellate hosts, thus enhancing coral reef productivity.","[Roopin, Modi; Henry, Raymond P.; Chadwick, Nanette E.] Auburn Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",24,10.1007/s00227-008-0948-5,2008

Yet, for subordinates, who typically invest less in reproduction, social status can change and opportunities to ascend to dominant social positions are presented suddenly, requiring abrupt changes in behaviour and physiology. In this study, we examined male reproductive anatomy, physiology and behaviour following experimental manipulations of social status in the cooperatively breeding cichlid fish, Neolamprologus pulcher. This unusual fish species lives in permanent social groups composed of a dominant breeding pair and 1-20 subordinates that form a linear social dominance hierarchy. By removing male breeders, we created 18 breeding vacancies and thus provided an opportunity for subordinate males to ascend in status. Dominant females play an important role in regulating status change, as males successfully ascended to breeder status only when they were slightly larger than the female breeder in their social group. Ascending males rapidly assumed behavioural dominance, demonstrated elevated gonadal investment and androgen concentrations compared with males remaining socially subordinate. Interestingly, to increase gonadal investment ascending males appeared to temporarily restrain somatic growth. These results highlight the complex interactions between social status, reproductive physiology and group dynamics, and underscore a convergent pattern of reproductive investment among highly social, cooperative species.","[Fitzpatrick, J.

While the effective implementation of marine protected areas (MPAs) increased the biomass of fish populations, coral reef builders and macroalgae followed patterns of change independent of MPAs.

Ages in days after hatching and days post-settlement were determined from the otoliths. Morphology of the nares and the olfactory epithelium are described for these species by stage. The separation of the anterior and posterior nares occurred before settlement in the labrids but in some specimens of scarids this separation was not complete by the time of settlement. Densities of ciliated and microvillous receptor cells and non-sensory ciliated epithelial cells were calculated.

The first technique employed was a method traditionally used to quantify herbivory on coral reefs via the (indirect) inference of herbivore impact from biomass estimates and reported feeding rates. The second method (one of a range of direct approaches) used remote underwater video cameras to film the daily feeding activity of roving herbivores in the absence of divers. Both techniques recorded similar patterns and relative levels of herbivore biomass across five reef zones at the study site. Indirect estimates of the grazing impact across the reef depth gradient of the three predominant species of herbivore broadly coincided with levels quantified directly by remote underwater video, indicating that, to a large extent, presence does correspond to function. However, the video data suggested that, for individual species in particular reef zones, the absolute level of impact may be less than that inferred from presence. In the case of the parrotfish Scarus rivulatus, the video recordings suggested that, at the reef crest, an average of 52% (+/- 18 SE) of each m(2) area of reef would be grazed each month, compared with an area of 109% (+/- 41 SE) suggested by inferring grazing activity from presence alone. Potential biases associated with remote video recorders may explain some of the discrepancy between values. Overall, the results suggest that, for some fish groups, the indirect method of inferring function from presence can provide a good indication of relative levels of herbivore impact across a coral reef.","[Bellwood, David R.] James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Fox, Rebecca J.; Bellwood, David R.] James Cook Univ N Queensland, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",22,10.1007/s00227-008-0927-x,2008

Both E (d) and A are derivable from various remote sensing data sources, thus the approach is feasible. This paper presents a demonstration of the application for Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, HI based on Quickbird satellite imagery and SHOALS LIDAR data. E (d) is modeled at every point in the image, and the image itself is inverted to provide A. Organismal-scale epsilon reported in the literature is taken as a surrogate for community-scale epsilon. The resulting GPP image compares well with the range of GPP values for reef-flats in general, as well as the distribution and range of GPP for Kaneohe Bay in particular.

After 6 months, settlement tile communities from inshore reefs were dominated by high biomass algal turfs (filamentous algae and cyanobacteria) whereas tiles located on offshore reefs were characterised by a mixed low biomass community of calcareous crustose algae, fleshy crustose algae and bare tile. The exclusion of macrograzers, via caging of tiles, on the outer reef sites resulted in the development of an algal turf community similar to that observed on inshore reefs. Caging on the inshore reef tiles had a limited impact on community composition or biomass. Water quality and herbivorous fish biomass were quantified at each site to elucidate factors that might influence algal community structure across the lagoon. Herbivore biomass was the dominant driver of algal community structure. Algal biomass on the other hand was controlled by both herbivory and water quality (particularly dissolved nutrients). This study demonstrates that algal communities on settlement tiles are an indicator capable of integrating the impacts of water quality and herbivory over a small spatial scale (kilometres) and short temporal scale (months), where other environmental drivers (current, light, regional variability) are constant.","[Albert, S.; Tibbetts, I.

It was found that (1) the catch composition of both groups of fishers overlapped considerably, (2) the numbers of target fish caught by spearfishers (156) and linefishers (168) were not significantly different, (3) the mean size of target fish caught by spearfishers (1.95 +/- 0.1 kg, +/- SE) was significantly larger than the mean size of target fish caught by linefishers (1.27 +/- 0.06 kg), and (4) spearfishers retained 43% more biomass of target species than did linefishers (304 versus 213 kg, respectively).

It is concluded that the overall impacts of recreational spearfishing and linefishing on fishery resources of the Great Barrier Reef are broadly equivalent (per unit of fishing effort), and that management regulations should be applied equitably across both fishing sectors. A management strategy of this type will simplify enforcement of fisheries regulations and avoid discrimination of particular fishers in local communities where both fishing methods are socially or culturally important.","[Frisch, A.

The second experiment compared the movement of adult and juvenile fishes to reefs broadcasting high (> 570 Hz), or low (< 570 Hz) frequency reef noise, or to silent reefs. Of the 122 adults collected, the highest diversity was seen at the low frequency reefs; and adults from two families (Gobiidae and Blenniidae) preferred these reefs. A similar trend was observed in the 372 juveniles collected, with higher diversity at the reefs with low frequency noises. This preference was seen in the juvenile apogonids; however, juvenile gobiids were attracted to both high and low sound treatments equally, and juvenile stage Acanthuridae preferred the high frequency noises. This evidence that juvenile and adult reef fishes orientate with respect to the soundscape raises important issues for management, conservation and the protection of sound cues used in natural behaviour.","[Simpson, S.

Primary cues for the assessment include visual and olfactory stimuli, but the relative importance of these sources of information for risk assessment has seldom been assessed for marine fishes. This study examined the importance of visual and chemical cues in assessing risk for the star goby, Asterropteryx semipunctatus. Visual and chemical cue intensities were used that were indicative of a high threat situation. The behavioural response elicited by both the visual cues of a predator (the rock cod, Cephalopholis boenak) and the chemical alarm cues from conspecifics were similar in magnitude, with responses including a decrease in feeding strikes and moves. A bobbing behaviour was exhibited when the predator was visible and not when only exposed to the chemical alarm cue. When visual and chemical cues were presented together they yielded a stronger antipredator response than when gobies were exposed solely to conspecific alarm cues. This suggests additivity of risk assessment information at the levels of threat used, however, the goby's response is also likely to depend on the environmental and social context of the predator-prey encounter. This study highlights the importance of chemical cues in the assessment of predation risk for a coral reef fish.","[McCormick, M.

The local scales comprised transects 10(0-2) m apart, sites 10(3-4) m apart and islands 10(4-6) m apart. The LSR-RSR relationship was never significantly different from linear at any scale. When the Chao1 estimator was used to predict true RSR and LSR, all relationships were also strongly linear.

However, the field effort required to evaluate these aspects of the benthos in situ, at the scale of entire reefscapes, is greatly constrained by logistical and resource limitations. With moderate ground truthing, both substratum type and seabed topography are amenable to monitoring using satellite data. Here, remote sensing imagery was used to resolve the bathymetry and benthic character of a reef system in Diego Garcia (British Indian Ocean Territory). Replicate fish counts were made at seven measurement stations across the study area using visual census. Monte Carlo simulation revealed that species richness and abundance of several guilds and size groupings of reef fish appraised in situ were correlated with the satellite-derived seabed parameters over areas of seafloor as large as 5,030 m(2). The study suggests that satellite remote sensing is capable of predicting habitat complexity at a scale relevant to fish.

In the present study, the size and spatial arrangement of the home range of the reef-associated checkered snapper Lutjanus decussatus (Lutjanidae) were investigated by use of a portable GPS receiver. In a 120 m x 120 m quadrat established on a section of the fringing reef of Ishigaki Island, 29 individuals of the species were identified by their color pattern and individuals were divided into five arbitrary size classes (class 1 < 10 cm TL <= class 2 < 15 cm TL <= class 3 < 20 cm TL <= class 4 < 25 cm TL <= class 5). Fish tracking by snorkeling was conducted with the portable GPS receiver. Site fidelity of this species was high. Home range size ranged from 93.0 to 3638.4 m(2), and there was a significant positive correlation between the home range size and fish total length. Home ranges of the same-sized individuals abutted each other (8.8% area overlap), whereas those of different-sized individuals overlapped (44.0% area overlap). Agonistic behavior (attack and agonistic display) was more frequently found among same-sized individuals (times of agonistic behavior/times of all encounters x 100 = 71.3%), whereas such agonistic behavior was rarely found among different-sized individuals (times of agonistic behavior/times of all encounters x 100 = 6.9%). These results suggest that home ranges of Lutjanus decussatus can be regarded as territories against same-sized individuals, but not different-sized individuals. The usefulness of the fish tracking by snorkeling using a portable GPS receiver for home range size estimation and the function of the overlapping territory of the species are discussed.","[Nanami, Atsushi; Yamada, Hideaki] Fisheries Res Agcy, Seikai Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Ishigaki Trop Stn, Okinawa 9070451, Japan",20,10.1007/s00227-007-0882-y,2008

In the present study, the population structures of two damselfishes, Stegastes fasciolatus and Dascyllus albisella, were examined using mitochondrial control region sequences. The two species have similar PLDs (similar to 25 and 27 days respectively), but consistently differ in their settlement preferences, habitat, and densities in populations throughout the Hawaiian Archipelago, from Hawaii north to Kure Atoll, and south to Johnston Atoll. Information on habitat preferences and population densities were collected between September 2000 and October 2002, and tissue samples for the genetic studies were collected between January and April 2004. Based on the differences in habitat and abundance of the two species, the expectation was that S. fasciolatus would have high genetic variability but little population structure compared to D. albisella, and this was largely confirmed. Stegastes fasciolatus had little population structure in most of the Hawaiian Islands, and D. albisella showed evidence of strong population structure throughout its range. An exception to this pattern was the large difference between the Kure Atoll population of S. fasciolatus and all others. These results suggest that the interaction of several biological factors (e.g. species-specific spawning habitat and season) with environmental factors (e.g. seasonal wind and current patterns) may have more influence on population structure than single life history characteristics, such as the PLD.","[Ramon, Marina L.; Nelson, Peter A.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Nelson, Peter A.] HT Harvey & Associates, Los Gatos, CA 95032 USA; [De Martini, Edward] SW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Ntal Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Walsh, William J.] Div Aquat Resources, Kailua, HI 96740 USA",21,10.1007/s00227-007-0894-7,2008

A combination of metagenomics, microscopy, culturing, and water chemistry were used to characterize microbial communities on four coral atolls in the Northern Line Islands, central Pacific. Kingman, a small uninhabited atoll which lies most northerly in the chain, had microbial and water chemistry characteristic of an open ocean ecosystem. On this atoll the microbial community was equally divided between autotrophs (mostly Prochlorococcus spp.) and heterotrophs. In contrast, Kiritimati, a large and populated (similar to 5500 people) atoll, which is most southerly in the chain, had microbial and water chemistry characteristic of a near-shore environment. On Kiritimati, there were 10 times more microbial cells and virus-like particles in the water column and these microbes were dominated by heterotrophs, including a large percentage of potential pathogens. Culturable Vibrios were common only on Kiritimati. The benthic community on Kiritimati had the highest prevalence of coral disease and lowest coral cover. The middle atolls, Palmyra and Tabuaeran, had intermediate densities of microbes and viruses and higher percentages of autotrophic microbes than either Kingman or Kiritimati. The differences in microbial communities across atolls could reflect variation in 1) oceaonographic and/or hydrographic conditions or 2) human impacts associated with land-use and fishing. The fact that historically Kingman and Kiritimati did not differ strongly in their fish or benthic communities (both had large numbers of sharks and high coral cover) suggest an anthropogenic component in the differences in the microbial communities. Kingman is one of the world's most pristine coral reefs, and this dataset should serve as a baseline for future studies of coral reef microbes. Obtaining the microbial data set, from atolls is particularly important given the association of microbes in the ongoing degradation of coral reef ecosystems worldwide.","[Dinsdale, Elizabeth A.; Pantos, Olga; Angly, Florent; Wegley, Linda; Hatay, Mark; Hall, Dana; Brown, Elysa; Haynes, Matthew; Thurber, Rebecca Vega; Rohwer, Forest] San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Dinsdale, Elizabeth A.] Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Smriga, Steven; Sala, Enric; Sandin, Stuart A.; Azam, Farooq; Knowlton, Nancy] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanography, Ctr Marine Biodiv & Conservat, La Jolla, CA USA; [Edwards, Robert A.; Rohwer, Forest] San Diego State Univ, Ctr Microbial Sci, San Diego, CA USA; [Edwards, Robert A.] Fellowship Interpretation Genomes, Burr Ridge, IL USA; [Krause, Lutz] Bielefeld Univ, CeBiTec, Bielefeld, Germany; [Willis, Bette L.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Stud, ARC, Townsville, Qld, Australia",227,10.1371/journal.pone.0001584,2008

For marine organisms with complex life cycles, experiences during larval life may influence phenotypic traits, performance, and the probability of postsettlement survival. For a Caribbean reef fish (Thalassoma bifasciatum) on an oceanic island, we used otolith (ear stone) elemental profiles of lead (Pb) to assign. recent settlers to a group that developed in waters elevated in Pb concentrations throughout larval life (i.e., nearshore signature) and a group that developed in waters depleted in Pb (i.e., offshore signature), potentially dispersing from upstream sources across oceanic waters. Larval history influenced early life history traits: offshore developers initially grew slowly but compensated with fast growth upon entering nearshore waters and metamorphosed in better condition with higher energy reserves. As shown in previous studies, local production contributed. heavily to settlement: at least 45% of settlers developed nearshore. However, only 23% of survivors after the first month displayed a nearshore otolith profile. Therefore, settlers with different larval histories suffered differential mortality. Importantly, selective mortality was mediated by larval history, in that the postsettlement intensity of selection was much greater for fish that developed nearshore, potentially because they had developed in a less selectively intense larval environment. Given the potential for asymmetrical postsettlement source-based survival, successful spatial management of marine populations may require knowledge of ""realized connectivity"" on ecological scales, which takes into account the postsettlement fitness of individuals from different sources.","[Hamilton, Scott L.; Warner, Robert R.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Regetz, James] Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA",92,10.1073/pnas.0707676105,2008

The protogynous wrasse Pseudolabrus sieboldi is a good model for understanding the physiological mechanisms of gonadal and body color change during sex change in hermaphrodite fish. To obtain information on the relationship between sex steroids and body color change during the process of gonadal sex change, we analyzed body color, gonadal histology, and serum levels of sex steroids. Body color was analyzed using a quantitative analytical method based on the hue value. Compared to other body parts of the fish, the anal fin changed color the most, becoming increasingly redder in association with gonadal changes that converted ovaries to testes. Levels of serum 11-ketotestosterone (11KT) increased as the gonadal sex change proceeded, whereas no significant change was observed in estradiol-17 beta (E2) levels. Moreover, we found a significant correlation between the hue value of the anal fin and serum 11KT levels, but not E2 levels. These results suggest that androgen, but not estrogen, plays a principle role in the changes in both gonadal morphology and body color in the transformation from female to male in this species.

Here we demonstrate for the first time that fangblennies adopted mimic colours in the presence of juvenile cleaner fish; however, this only occurred in smaller individuals. Field data indicated that when juvenile cleaner fish were abundant, the proportion of mimic to non-mimic fangblennies was greater, suggesting that fangblennies adopt their mimic disguise depending on the availability of cleaner fish. Finally, measurements of spectral reflectance suggest that not only do mimic fangblennies accurately resemble the colour of their cleaner fish models but also mimic other species of fish that they associate with.

Both AMOVA and pairwise F (ST) analyses showed that, in concordance with previous mitochondrial results, most genetic variance occurs within individual populations, as population differentiation is evident only over the largest distances (> 3,700 km). This result is contrasted with previous studies demonstrating that despite their relatively long larval periods, some gobiid fishes exhibit population differentiation on small (< 100 km) geographic scales. Coalescence analysis showed that current Pacific populations of these species originated in the Pleistocene, presumably related to sea level fluctuations associated with episodes of glaciation.

A geochemical model is here proposed for reef formation, taking into account diffusion-limited and light-enhanced calcification. First, to obtain data on net photosynthesis and calcification rates in the field, a typical coral community was cultured in situ on a reef flat. Using these data, equations including parameters for calcification were then developed and applied in computer simulations to model the development over time of reef profiles and the diffusion of carbon species. The reef topography simulated by the model was in general agreement with reef topography observed in nature. The process of reef growth as shown by the modeling was as follows. Increases in the shore-to-offshore gradients of the concentrations of carbonate species result from calcification by reef biota, giving a lower rate of growth on near-shore parts of the reef than on those further offshore. As a result, original topography is diversified into moat and reef crest for the first time. Reef growth on the reef crest is more rapid than in the inshore moat area, because more light is available at the crest. Reef growth on the nearshore side of the reef is further inhibited by damming of carbon-rich seawater on the seaward side of the reef by the reef crest. Over time, the topographic expression of the reef crest and moat becomes progressively more clearly defined by these geochemical processes.","[Nakamura, T.; Nakamori, T.] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan",15,10.1007/s00338-007-0262-6,2007

They can contribute calcium carbonate to the reef framework, stabilise the substrate, and promote larval recruitment of other framework-building species (e.g. coral recruits). The percentage cover of encrusting organisms and their rates of carbonate production (g m(-2) year(-1)) were assessed at four sites within a coastal embayment, along a gradient of riverine influence (high-low). As the orientation and type of substrate is thought to influence recruitment of encrusting organisms, organisms recruiting to both natural (the underside of platy corals) and experimental substrates were assessed. The effect of substrate exposure under different levels of riverine influence was assessed by orientating experimental substrates to mimic cryptic and exposed reef habitats (downwards-facing vs upwards-facing tiles) at each site. Cryptic experimental tiles supported similar encruster assemblages to those recruiting to the underneath (cryptic side) of platy corals, suggesting that tiles can be used as an experimental substrate to assess encruster recruitment in reef systems. Encruster cover, in particular CCA, and carbonate production was significantly higher at low-impact (clear water), high wave energy sites when compared to highly riverine impacted (turbid water), low wave energy sites. Cryptically orientated substrates supported a greater diversity of encrusting organisms, in particular serpulid worms and bryozoans.

In unconstrained retrievals the retrieved bathymetry was on average within 5% of that measured acoustically, and 92% of pixels had retrieved depths within 25% of the acoustic depth. Retrieved absorption coefficients had less than 20% errors observed at blue wavelengths. The reef scale benthic classification derived by analysis of the imagery was consistent with the percent cover of specific coral reef habitat classes obtained by conventional line transects over the reef, and the inversions were robust as the results were similar when the benthic classification retrieval was constrained by measurements of bathymetry or water column optical properties. These results support the use of calibrated hyperspectral imagery for the rapid determination of bathymetry, water optical propel-ties, and the classification of important habitat classes common to coral reefs.","[Lesser, M.

Despite a growing body of research demonstrating their abundance, and their effects on algae, corals and other grazers, there has been little research on the effects of the territorial damselfish community as a whole. This study investigated the space occupation, territory composition, and diet of ten damselfish species at three locations: Magnetic and Orpheus Islands (Great Barrier Reef), and Kimbe Bay (Papua New Guinea). Territories were measured, and the composition of benthic communities inside and outside territories was assessed both in situ and from algal collections. The stomach contents of territorial damselfishes were also quantified. Although the larger, previously well-studied species had the most visible effect on the benthic community in their territories, all the smaller species also significantly affected the algal composition, normally with an increase of palatable algae. However, the composition of algal assemblages inside the territories of different species varied considerably. Damselfish territories were highly individual, not just among species, but also among locations. Diets were diverse and indicated a greater degree of omnivory and detritivory than previously thought. At all locations, territories occupied a substantial proportion of the substratum: > 25% on Magnetic Island, > 50% at Orpheus Island, and similar to 50% in Kimbe Bay. Within individual zones, this figure was as high as 70%. The contribution of territorial damselfishes to a range of benthic patterns and processes is considerable, and future benthic studies may need to distinguish more closely between territory and non-territory areas.","[Ceccarelli, D.

The goal of this study was to provide methods for mapping juvenile fish species richness and abundance into spatial domains suitable for micro and meso-scale analysis and management decisions. Generalized Linear Models predicting juvenile fish species richness and abundance were developed according to spatial and temporal environmental variables measured from 10 m up to 10 kin in the southwest lagoon of New Caledonia. The statistical model was further spatially generalized using a 1.5-m resolution, independently created, remotely sensed, habitat map. This procedure revealed that : (1) spatial factors at 10 to 100-m scale explained up to 71% of variability in juvenile species richness, (2) a small improvement (75%) was gained when a combination of environmental variables at different spatial and temporal scales was used and (3) the coupling of remotely sensed data, geographical information system tools and point-based ecological data showed that the highest species richness and abundance were predicted along a narrow margin overlapping the coral reef flat and adjacent seagrass beds.

New evidence is emerging that during the past few thousand years there has been increasing exploitation of coral reef resources, particularly finfish and mollusks, leading to a decline in taxa numbers, richness, and diversity in various locales. This paper examines the historical interactions between human populations and coral reef ecologies in Palau by combining known archaeological data and results from modern biological data of different reef fauna. The integration of these data sources provides a framework for attempting to explain variations in taxa composition between islands in the archipelago and how this may relate to human exploitation or other phenomena through time. By using this perspective to link past events with present-day conditions, we can gain a better sense of the extent to which anthropogenic changes may have affected island environments in western Micronesia during the Late Holocene. The study also illustrates the many difficulties researchers face in attempting to synthesize and explain past and present human predation behavior when using disparate sources of data.","[Fitzpatrick, S.

Using faunal data to assess subsistence patterns of vertebrate exploitation during late site occupation, we can begin to better understand Grand Bay procurement strategies and coral reef exploitation. Preliminary zooarchaeological results imply that Grand Bay vertebrate exploitation emphasized marine resources over terrestrial resources, with particular emphasis on coral reef habitats and fish. The faunal data are discussed in relation to common patterns of prehistoric vertebrate exploitation in the Caribbean and fishing strategies.

R.",Mollusk collecting and environmental change during the Prehistoric Period in the Mariana Islands,CORAL REEFS,SEA-LEVELS; PACIFIC,"Archaeological research in the Mariana Islands has revealed changes in mollusk collecting during the Prehistoric Period (approximately 1500 BC to AD 1521). The earliest people at Tumon Bay, Guam and Chalan Piao, Saipan collected mostly bivalves, especially the arc clam Anadara antiquata. After several hundred years, they no longer collected A. antiquata, but collected smaller bivalves instead. By AD 1000, they collected mostly gastropods, primarily the coral reef species Strombus gibberulus gibbosus. One possible explanation is that the people preferred the large arc clam but overharvested it until they were forced to eat the smaller bivalves and then the snails. However, recent evidence in the form of mangrove wood and mangrove pollen supports another explanation, one of non-anthropogenic environmental change. In this case, the relative sea-level decline, which took place in the Marianas within the last 4,000 years, caused the demise of mangrove habitats and of the arc clam at Tumon Bay, Guam and Chalan Piao, Saipan. As mangrove habitats were diminished by sea-level decline, collecting effort shifted to coral reefs, and S. gibberulus gibbosus was harvested throughout the remainder of the Prehistoric Period and into the Historic Period. Southern Guam is the only area in the Marianas in which A. antiquata increased in abundance during the Prehistoric Period. The same types of evidence, mangrove wood and mangrove pollen, indicate that, in contrast to the situation at Tumon Bay and Chalan Piao, mangroves increased in abundance in southern Guam.","[Amesbury, J.

Their functional roles, however, over ecological and evolutionary times scales are not well known, in part because their numbers have been so drastically reduced. Ethnographic and archaeological data is analysed to assess long-term patterns of human-sea turtle interactions (mainly green and hawksbill) prior to western contact and the magnitude of turtle losses in this region. From the ethnographic data two large-scale patterns emerge, societies where turtle capture and consumption was controlled by chiefs and priests versus those where control over turtle was more flexible and consumption more egalitarian. Broadly the distinction is between societies on high (volcanic and raised coral) islands versus atolls, but the critical variables are the ratio of land to shallow marine environments, combined with the availability of refugia. Archaeological evidence further highlights differences in the rate and magnitude of turtle losses across these two island types, with high islands suffering both large and rapid declines while those on atolls are less marked. These long-term historical patterns help explain the ethnographic endpoints, with areas that experienced greater losses apparently developing more restrictive social controls over time. Finally, if current turtle migration patterns held in the past, with annual movements between western foraging grounds and eastern nesting beaches, then intensive harvesting from 2,800 Before Present in West Polynesia probably affected turtle abundance and coral reef ecology in East Polynesia well before the actual arrival of human settlers, the latter a process that most likely began 1,400 years later.","[Allen, M.

The growth of tourism in Belize has resulted in the fact that many coastal communities are in varying stages of a socio-economic shift from dependence on fishing to dependence on tourism. In a nation becoming increasingly dependent on the health of its coral reef ecosystems for economic prosperity, a shift from extractive uses to their preservation is both necessary and logical. Through examining local perception data in five coastal communities in Belize, each attracting different levels of coral reef related tourism, this analysis is intended to explore the relationship between tourism development and local coral reef conservation awareness and support. The results of the analysis show a positive correlation between tourism development and coral reef conservation awareness and support in the study communities. The results also show a positive correlation between tourism development and local perceptions of quality of life, a trend that is most likely the source of the observed relationship between tourism and conservation. The study concludes that, because the observed relationship may be dependent on continued benefits from tourism as opposed to a perceived crisis in coral reef health, Belize must pay close attention to tourism impacts in the future. Failure to do this could result in a destructive feedback loop that would contribute to the degradation of the reef and, ultimately, Belize's diminished competitiveness in the ecotourism market.","[Diedrich, A.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Marine Affairs, Kingston, RI 02881 USA",27,10.1007/s00338-007-0224-z,2007

This study investigates socio-economic changes, specifically in fresh fish consumption and fishing activities, associated with environmental degradation at five fishing grounds (qoliqoli) in the Lau Islands (Fiji). Semi-structured interviews with fishers and senior household members revealed that the importance of fishing was low relative to other occupations, and consumption of fresh fish has declined over the last decade. Reduced fishing and choice of fresh fish is lamely attributable to an increased need to derive income as well as new income-generating opportunities. A possible consequence of reduced reliance on marine resources was limited awareness of recent environmental degradation caused by climate-induced coral bleaching and outbreaks of coral-feeding crown-of-thorns starfish. Limited use and reduced awareness of the local marine environment in the short term may erode social memory and local ecological knowledge, reducing opportunities to fall back on marine resources. This may also compromise long-term economic and social stability. Conversely, low reliance on marine resources may confer greater flexibility to adapt to future ecological change in the marine environment. Importantly, changes in fish consumption and exploitation of marine resources were linked to socio-economic factors rather than a consequence of recent degradation of marine environments. Greater knowledge of the dynamics driving change in marine resource use is necessary to understand how societies respond to ecological and socio-economic change, and to identify opportunities for adaptive sustainable ecosystem management.","[Turner, R.

Some researchers attribute part of these shortcomings to inadequate attention to the social context of conserving marine resources. To gain insights into applying Western conservation theory more successfully in the socioeconomic context of developing countries, this study examines how long-enduring, customary reef closures appear to reflect local socioeconomic conditions in two Papua New Guinean communities. Attributes of the customary management (including size, shape, permanence, and gear restrictions) are examined in relation to prevailing socioeconomic conditions (including resource users' ability to switch gears, fishing grounds, and occupations). Customary closures in the two communities appear to reflect local socioeconomic circumstances in three ways. First, in situations where people can readily switch between occupations, full closures are acceptable with periodic harvests to benefit from the closure. In comparison, communities with high dependence on the marine resources are more conducive to employing strategies that restrict certain gear types while still allowing others. Second, where there is multiple clan and family spatial ownership of resources, the communities have one closure per clan/family; one large no-take area would have disproportionate affect on those compared to the rest of the community. In contrast, communities that have joint ownership can establish one large closure as long as there are other areas available to harvest. Third, historical and trade relationships with neighboring communities can influence regulations by creating the need for occasional harvests to provide fish for feasts. This study further demonstrates the importance of understanding the socioeconomic context of factors such as community governance and levels of dependence for the conservation of marine resources.","[Cinner, J.

The impact this has on coral reef fish is receiving increasing attention, with one focal area assessing impacts on fish that feed directly on live coral. It appears that the more specialised a species of corallivore, the more susceptible it is to coral declines. However data are sparse for the Indian Ocean, and little is known about why some corals are preferentially fed upon over others. Here I assess feeding specialisation in three species of coral feeding butterflyfish in the Chagos Archipelago, central Indian Ocean, assess the food quality of the coral genera they target and document patterns of decline in the Seychelles following a severe coral mortality event. Cheatodon trifascialis was the most specialised coral feeder, preferentially selecting for Acropora corals, however, when Acropora was scarce, individuals showed considerable feeding plasticity, particularly for the dominant Pocillopora corals. C. trifasciatus also preferentially fed on Acropora corals, but fed on a much more diverse suite of corals and also displayed some selectivity for Porites. C. auriga is a facultative corallivore and consumed similar to 55% live coral, which lies within the wide range of coral dependence reported for this species. C:N ratio analysis indicated Lobophyllia and Acropora have the highest food quality, with Pocillopora having the lowest, which conforms with diet selection of corallivores and helps explain preferential feeding. Obligate specialist feeders displayed the greatest declines through coral mortality in the Seychelles with obligate generalists also declining substantially, but facultative feeders showing little change. Clearly a greater understanding of the species most vulnerable to disturbance, their habitat requirements and the functional roles they play will greatly assist biodiversity conservation in a changing climate.","Univ Newcastle Upon Tyne, Sch Marine Sci & Technol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",41,10.1007/s00227-007-0786-x,2007

One mechanism that may afford habitat generalists greater persistence is their ability to successfully emigrate from degrading environments. This study compared the response of habitat specialist and generalist reef fish species to live coral disturbance. In replicate coral colonies, live coral was experimentally degraded (low, medium and high coral loss). Species continued residence within the colonies was then surveyed over time. In addition, the ability of habitat generalist and specialist species to migrate between degraded (100% loss) and live coral colonies was compared. Habitat specialists exhibited a higher propensity to remain in colonies with low levels of coral loss. However, there was no significant difference between specialist and generalist species in continued residence in habitats with either medium or high levels of coral loss; both functional groups showed low levels of residence. In terms of migration success, generalists moved further than specialists and showed higher levels of successful migration over the majority of distances examined. The influence of habitat specialization on the behavioral response to coral loss may be a useful predictor of changes to coral reef fish communities in response to coral disturbance.","James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Tropical Biol, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",33,10.1007/s00227-007-0791-0,2007

Water collected from foamy intertidal pools and tide channels showed a high concentration of P. praeputialis early developing stages and tadpole larvae in the foam. Because gametes are synchronically spawned for external fertilization and larvae settle near adults, our results suggest that this bio-foam increases fertilization success and effective settlement of their short-lived larvae in the vicinity of the adults spawning the gametes. This mechanism reinforces published evidence suggesting that local retention of intertidal and inshore marine invertebrate larvae may be more common than previously thought, offering, for instance, new perspectives for the design and networking of marine protected and management areas.","Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Adv Studies Ecol & Biodivers, Fac Ciencias Biol, Santiago, Chile; Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Quim Fis, Fac Quim, Santiago, Chile; Univ Austral Chile, Lab Recursos Acuat Calfuco, Inst Biol Marina Dr Jurgen Winter, Valdivia, Chile",23,10.1073/pnas.0708233104,2007

Here, we demonstrate that bluestriped fangblennies (Plagiotremus rhinorhynchos), which are aggressive mimics of juvenile bluestreak cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus), derive significant protection benefits from their resemblance to cleaner fish. Field observations revealed that mimetic fangblennies were chased by potential victims less often than individuals of a closely related, ecologically and behaviourally similar but non- mimetic species (Plagiotremus tapeinosoma). After attacks, proximity to models protected mimics from retaliation by victims, but the effect of colour similarity was less clear. Both colour resemblance and physical proximity to models thus appear to protect cleaner- fish mimics from aggression by potential and actual victims of their attacks.

Video images were collected from shallow (8-12 m) and deep (22-26 m) reef sites inside a Marine Protected Area (MPA) at each of three island groups and from three replicate fished locations at each of these groups that span a temperate-tropical transition area.

Mimicry systems are frequently tripartite interactions involving a mimic, model and 'signal receiver'. Changes in the strength of the relationship between model and signal receiver, owing to shifting environmental conditions, for example, can affect the success of mimics in protective mimicry systems. Here, we show that an experimentally induced shift in the strength of the relationship between a model (bluestreak cleaner fish, Labroides dimidiatus) and a signal receiver (staghorn damselfish, Amblyglyphidodon curacao) resulted in increased foraging success for an aggressive mimic (bluestriped fangblenny, Plagiotremus rhinorhynchos). When the parasite loads of staghorn damselfish clients were experimentally increased, the attack success of bluestriped fangblenny on damselfish also increased. Enhanced mimic success appeared to be due to relaxation of vigilance by parasitized clients, which sought cleaners more eagerly and had lower overall aggression levels. Signal receivers may therefore be more tolerant of and/or more vulnerable to attacks from aggressive mimics when the net benefit of interacting with their models is high. Changes in environmental conditions that cause shifts in the net benefits accrued by models and signal receivers may have important implications for the persistence of aggressive mimicry systems.","Univ Queensland, Sch Integrat Biol, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",6,10.1098/rspb.2007.0543,2007

Skeletal growth and calcification rates were also influenced by source population, even though zooxanthella genotype of source colonies did not vary between sites, and there was a transplant site x source population interaction for upward linear extension. Genetic differentiation may explain the source population effects, or the experiment may have been too brief for phenotypic plasticity of all skeletal characteristics to be fully expressed.

Gobies did not exhibit an alarm response when challenged with extracts from damaged fish from a different taxonomic family. The behavioural response in the field was similar to that observed in laboratory experiments.

This study examined the swimming ability and refuging behaviour of a labrid (Halichoeres margaritaceus) and a pomacentrid (Pomacentrus chrysurus) that inhabit high flow, wave-swept coral reef flats. Field observations of refuging patterns were combined with experimental evaluations in a flow tank using a replica of a substratum hole frequently used by these species. Under a range of flow speeds commonly found on the reef flat (0-60 cm s(-1)), flow within the substratum refuge was reduced to speeds of 0-12 cm s(-1), representing a 75-100% flow reduction. Swimming ability of each species was then tested at 60 cm s(-1) with and without access to this flow refuge. Both species were able to maintain activity within the 60 cm s(-1) flow for considerably longer when provided with a refuge, with increases from approximately 39 min to 36 h for H. margaritaceus and 8 min to 88 h for P. chrysurus. Despite H. margaritaceus having the strongest swimming ability without access to a refuge, P. chrysurus was able to maintain swimming activity more than twice as long as H. margaritaceus when provided with a refuge. These increases in activity are probably due to energetic savings, with this type of refuge providing an estimated 95% energy saving over swimming directly into a unidirectional flow of 60 cm s(-1). These results highlight the major advantages provided by refuging behaviour and emphasise the importance of habitat refuges in shaping patterns of habitat use in reef fishes.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; Australian Natl Univ, Sch Bot & Zool, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",28,10.1007/s00338-007-0217-y,2007

Polygyny is predicted where males can economically defend multiple females or essential resources used by females. In contrast, monogamy is predicted where neither sex can monopolise multiple partners, either directly or through resource control, but where one mate is economically defendable. The mating system and reproductive behaviour of five species of coral reef goby were investigated and contrasted with population density and individual mobility. The two most abundant species (Asterropteryx semipunctatus and Istigobius goldmanni) were polygynous. In contrast, the less populous and more widely dispersed epibenthic species (Amblygobius bynoensis, Amblygobius phalaena and Valenciennea muralis) were pair forming and monogamous. All five species had low mobility, mostly remaining within metres (3 epibenthic species) or centimetres (2 cryptobenthic species) of a permanent shelter site. Interspecific differences in the mating system may have been shaped by differences in population density and the ability of reproductive individuals to economically defend breeding partners/sites. However, in a test of mating system plasticity, males of the three monogamous species did not mate polygynously when given the opportunity to do so in experimental manipulations of density and sex ratio. Mate guarding and complex spawning characteristics, which have likely co-evolved with the monogamous mating system, could contribute to mating system inflexibility by making polygynous mating unprofitable for individuals of the pair forming species, even when presented with current-day ecological conditions that usually favour polygyny.","Univ Otago, Dept Marine Sci, Dunedin, New Zealand; James Cook Univ N Queensland, Ctr Coral Reef Biodivers, Sch Marine Biol & Aqualculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",21,10.1007/s00338-007-0222-1,2007

C. rollandi consistently selected rubble habitats at each depth, however abundance patterns did not reflect the availability of the preferred microhabitat suggesting a preference for depth as well as microhabitat. Reproductive investment (gonado-somatic index), energy stores (liver cell density and hepatocyte vacuolation), and overall body condition (hepato-somatic index and Fulton's K) of female fish varied significantly among depths and among the three reefs sampled. Male conspecifics displayed no variation between depth or reef. Depth influenced growth dynamics, with faster initial growth rates and smaller mean asymptotic lengths with decreasing depth. In female fish, relative gonad weight and overall body condition (Fulton's K and hepato-somatic index) were generally higher in shallower depths (<= 10 m). Hepatic lipid storage was highest at the deepest sites sampled on each reef, whereas hepatic glycogen stores tended to decrease with depth. Depth was found to influence energy allocation dynamics in C. rollandi. While it is unclear what processes directly influenced the depth-related patterns in energy allocation, this study shows that individuals across a broad depth gradient are not all in the same physiological state and may contribute differentially to the population reproductive output.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",19,10.1007/s00338-007-0246-6,2007

In 1998 Cousin Island reefs suffered extensive coral mortality following a coral bleaching event, and a phase shift from coral to algal dominance ensued. By 2005 mean coral cover was < 1%, structural complexity had fallen and there had been a substantial increase in macroalgal cover, up to 40% in some areas. No clear trends were apparent in the overall numerical abundance and biomass of herbivorous fishes between 1994 and 2005, although smaller individuals became relatively scarce, most likely due to the loss of reef structure. Analysis of the feeding habits of six abundant and representative herbivorous fish species around Cousin Island in 2006 demonstrated that epilithic algae were the preferred food resource of all species and that macroalgae were avoided. Given the current dominance of macroalgae and the apparent absence of macroalgal consumers, it is suggested that the increasing abundance of macroalgae is reducing the probability of the system reverting to a coral dominated state.","Univ Newcastle, Sch Marine Sci & Technol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; Univ Newcastle, Sch Biol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Lowestoft Lab, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England; Ctr Environm & Educ, Roche Caiman, Mahe, Seychelles",109,10.1007/s00338-007-0230-1,2007

In the Au'au Channel, the depth distribution of megabenthic taxa exhibited a pattern of vertical zonation with relatively few taxa dominating each zone. Macroalgae particularly Halimeda spp. and to a lesser extent scleractinian corals Leptoseris spp. were dominant between 50 and 80 m; Leptoseris spp. were dominant between 80 and 90 m as macroalgae decreased in abundance; the invasive octocoral Carijoa riisei was dominant between 90 and 100 m primarily on rugose features; Antipathes spp. and Leptoseris spp. were dominant between 100 and 120 m on exposed fossil reef; and small wire corals were dominant between 120 and 140 m. In general, the percentage of live benthic cover decreased with depth, particularly below 90 m where a large majority of the area was uncolonized, soft substrata. The gradient of downwelling light intensity appears to play a major role in regulating the depth distribution of photosynthetic organisms, skilophilous organisms, and other benthic fauna, which compete for space with dominant photosynthetic species. The depth of the seasonal thermocline also appears to play an important role in limiting the distribution of tropical benthic species.","Univ Hawaii, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Undersea Res Lab, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",62,10.1007/s00338-007-0253-7,2007

This work was carried out to investigate whether ""small"" NTAs could be effective management strategies over a time scale that is relevant to local fishery communities and their perception of management success. Our research also documents the ecology of these species, information essential if we are to understand how management practises are to affect coral reef fish species. Designation of this ""small NTA"" increased the density of groupers by 30% over a 5-year period of protected status. After 5 years of protection, grouper populations within this NTA were more mature and double the density of those within the adjacent lightly fished sites and nearly five times those of a heavily fished site. During this time all other nearby fished sites underwent large declines in grouper density. The nearby lightly fished Kaledupa site decreased by up to 50% year(1). Such drastic declines are considered the impact of the exponential development of ever efficient and unsustainable methods of fishing within the study region. This NTA was not of benefit to all grouper species; the reasons for which are not clear. Such questions require further detailed research about the life history, population and behavioural ecology of Indo-Pacific grouper species. Such information is critical for urgently needed fisheries management. The present study found that a small scale NTA of 500 m length was large enough to increase the population of top predatory fish. In conjunction with other socially acceptable small scale NTAs it could help maintain and increase important fish stocks over a larger area.

Using samples collected in June 2002 from Three Sisters Reef and Conch Reef in the Key Largo, Florida area, transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis were performed on tissues of the sponges Ircinia felix and Aplysina cauliformis, which are in the low delta N-15 group, and on tissue of the sponge Niphates erecta, which is in the high delta N-15 group. Results showed that I. felix and A. cauliformis have large and diverse microbial communities, while N. erecta has a low biomass of one bacterial strain. As the low delta N-15 ratios indicated a microbial input of nitrogen, these results suggested that I. felix and A. cauliformis were receiving nitrogen from their associated microbial community, while N. erecta was obtaining nitrogen solely from external sources. Sequence analysis of the microbial communities showed a diversity of metabolic capabilities among the microbes of the low delta N-15 group, which are lacking in the high delta N-15 group, further supporting metabolic differences between the two groups.

To identify which individual attributes are the most influential in determining patterns of survival in a cohort of reef fish, we compared the characteristics of Pomacentrus amboinensis surviving early juvenile stages on the reef with those of the cohort from which they originated. Individuals were collected at hatching, the end of the planktonic phase, and two, three, four, six and eight weeks post-settlement. Information stored in the otoliths of individual fish revealed strong carry-over effects of larval condition at hatching on juvenile survival, weeks after settlement (i.e. smaller-is-better). Among the traits examined, planktonic growth history was, by far, the most influential and long-lasting trait associated with juvenile persistence in reef habitats. However, otolith increments suggested that larval growth rate may not be maintained during early juvenile life, when selective mortality swiftly reverses its direction. These changes in selective pressure may mediate growth-mortality trade-offs between predation and starvation risks during early juvenile life.

Acoustic telemetry was used to quantify the movements of a large coral reef top predator (Aprion virescens, Lutjanidae; Hawaiian name 'uku') at five atolls in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument (NWHIMNM) from May 2005 to September 2006. The study atolls were located between 23.8 degrees N, 166.2 degrees W and 28.5 degrees N, 178.3 degrees W, and were separated from their nearest receiver-equipped neighbor by distances ranging from 100 to 478 km. No inter-atoll movements by uku were detected but individuals were seasonally site-attached to core activity areas of up to 12 km in length, and ranged up to 19 km across atolls. Within their core areas, tagged uku exhibited diel and tidal habitat shifts, with the latter resulting in round trips of up to 24 km in 24 h. Seasonal uku migrations resulted in extended winter (October-April) absences from summer (May-September) core activity areas and may be linked to summer spawning. Large MPAs (i.e., entire islands, atolls or banks) would probably be required for full protection of resident populations of adult uku, but such 'island-scale' MPAs will not benefit fisheries unless there is significant larval supply from MPAs to neighboring fished areas, or adult emigration over time scales exceeding the 16-month monitoring period of this study. A mixed management strategy of combining smaller MPAs with conventional measures (e.g., minimum size limits, catch, and effort restrictions) may be the best approach for sustaining uku fisheries. However, this would still require relatively large MPAs (12 km in length) to contain uku short-term (diel and tidal) movements, and seasonal migrations would still take uku beyond the boundaries of MPAs of this size. These fluxes across MPA boundaries could supply fish to fisheries but, if high exploitation rates exist, fishing could eliminate key MPA benefits such as increased numbers of large, highly fecund individuals.","Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Zool, Edmonson Hall, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",50,10.1007/s00227-007-0647-7,2007

A total of 1,665 molluscan individuals from 51 taxa was counted on 44 transects, which covered 220 m(2) at eight diving sites. The most important molluscs in the assemblage were the parasitic gastropod Coralliophila neritoidea, the encrusting gastropod Dendropoma maxima and the coral-associated bivalve Pedum spondyloideum. The dead assemblage, in contrast, was dominated by encrusting bivalves (Ostreoidea, Chamoidea, Spondylidae) and the coral-predating gastropod Drupella cornus. Distinct molluscan assemblages inhabit each of the three fringing reef-habitats and most of the important depth-related community changes occurred within the uppermost 5 m. In contrast, the three deeper fore-reef habitats are characterized by a more uniform molluscan composition. Molluscan assemblages were more dependent on substrata and their coral associations than on water depth. Comparisons with other published studies indicate that reefoidal hard substrata in the northern Red Sea are largely characterized by similar species-abundance patterns. The minor differences to other Red Sea studies probably reflect the northern, isolated position of the Gulf of Aqaba, the lack of certain molluscan habitats, and the differential impact of anthropogenic influences. Strong differences between living and dead assemblages in Aqaba are similar to those observed in other regions and are due to distinct biases in the dead assemblage. Molluscs closely associated with living corals (mostly bivalves and Dendropoma) can easily be overgrown after death and are thus undetectable in visual censuses. Some gastropod taxa are preferentially transported into surrounding soft-substrata postmortem or redistributed by hermit crabs. Such complex relationships between ecology and taphonomy are crucial in evaluating the quality of the molluscan fossil record in coral reef environments. The comparison of our results with literature data documents an increase in coral predators during the last two decades in the northern Red Sea. Due to the greater mollusc biodiversity in the shallower Aqaba reef habitats, damage to this coral reef zone would have the greatest impact on the overall mollusc community.","Univ Vienna, Dept Paleontol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; Univ Vienna, Dept Marine Biol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",22,10.1007/s00227-007-0656-6,2007

Employing a unique combination of laboratory performance trials and field observations of swimming speed, this study investigated the comparative performance of pectoral and body-caudal fin swimming within an entire assemblage of coral reef fishes (117 species 10 families). Field observations of swimming behaviour identified three primary modes: labriform (pectoral 70 spp.), subcarangiform (body-caudal 29 spp.) and chaetodontiform (augmented body-caudal 18 spp.). While representative taxa from all three modes were capable of speeds exceeding 50 cm s(-1) during laboratory trials, only pectoral-swimmers maintained such high speeds under field conditions. Direct comparisons revealed that pectoral-swimming species maintained field speeds at a remarkable 70% of their maximum (lab-tested) recorded speed; species using body-caudal fin propulsion maintained field speeds at around 50% of maximum. These findings highlight a profound influence of swimming mode on performance, with the relative mechanical and energetic efficiency of each swimming mode being of major importance. Combining attributes of efficiency, maneuverability and speed in one mode of propulsion, pectoral swimming appears to be a particularly versatile form of locomotion, well suited to a demersal lifestyle on coral reefs.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",49,10.1007/s00338-007-0195-0,2007

Here it is shown for the first time that coral reef fishes from the genera Gobiodon, Paragobiodon and Caracanthus, which all have an obligate association with living coral, also exhibit hypoxia tolerance and a well-developed air-breathing capacity. All nine species maintained adequate respiration in water at oxygen concentrations down to 15-25% air saturation. This hypoxia tolerance is probably needed when the oxygen levels in the coral habitat drops sharply at night. Air-breathing abilities of the species correlated with habitat association, being greatest (equaling oxygen uptake in water) in species that occupy corals extending into shallow water, where they may become air exposed during extreme low tides. Air-breathing was less well-developed or absent in species inhabiting corals from deeper waters. Loss of scales and a network of subcutaneous capillaries appear to be key adaptations allowing cutaneous respiration in air. While hypoxia tolerance may be an ancestral trait in these fishes, air-breathing is likely to be a more recent adaptation exemplifying convergent evolution in the unrelated genera Gobiodon and Caracanthus in response to coral-dwelling lifestyles.","Univ Oslo, Dept Mol Biosci, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine Biol & Aquaculture, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; Natl Lib Norway, N-0203 Oslo, Norway",17,10.1007/s00338-006-0167-9,2007

However, movement data obtained with mark-capture techniques are often influenced by artefacts (e.g., displacement, tag-loss, tag-induced injury). To avoid these problems, a novel approach was employed to investigate the movements of an important coral reef palinurid, the painted lobster (Panulirus versicolor). Eighty adult individuals were captured by hand near Northwest Island, Australia. Each lobster was tagged internally (with elastomer) and externally (with plastic zip-ties) to enable both short- (1-10 days) and long-term (6-24 months) observations. Shortly thereafter, all lobsters were manually returned to their shelters (dens). After 6-24 months, 44 lobsters were recaptured, giving an overall recapture rate of 55%. All of these individuals were recaptured within 500 m of their original den, thus indicating a high level of site-fidelity for this species. Short-term observations revealed that individuals moved frequently to and from nearby dens, and that male lobsters typically moved further than female lobsters. It is hypothesized that male lobsters move about their home range more actively, perhaps to seek mating opportunities or to defend resources. The significance of these observations is discussed with respect to the management of this important fishery resource.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Australia Res Council, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",18,10.1007/s00338-006-0194-6,2007

In Pohnpei (Micronesia), a recent coral reef fish market survey revealed a reliance on night-time spearfishing and a serranid catch composed primarily of juveniles and small adults of practically all epinepheline species. Fishing effort was concentrated in one of five municipalities and was disproportionate to the population distribution. Lagoon areas were fished preferentially to outer reef areas, with both catch size distribution and species composition similar between the two areas. Some species were unique to a particular gear type, but catch composition did not vary substantially between spear and line fishing. Existing seasonal sales bans, meant to protect reproductively active serranids, appeared to place additional pressure on other families during ban periods. The study identified the need for a comprehensive management plan that merges traditional measures, including size limits and gear restrictions, with precautionary management tools. Specifically, the scale and scope of marine protected areas should be increased to protect juveniles and other life history stages over wider areas than currently employed.","Univ Hawaii, Coll Agr Forestry & Nat Resource Management, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; WorldFish Ctr, George Town 10670, Malaysia; Univ Guam, Marine Lab, UOG Stn, Mangilao, GU 96923 USA",42,10.1007/s00338-007-0202-5,2007

About 209 taxa were observed in the GBR sediments studied, with an average abundance of 2.55 x 10(6) cells ml(-1) in the upper 1 cm of sediment.

The only distinct correlates were inorganic carbon and the distance to the mainland associated with OS communities. Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) of diatom community composition revealed significant differences between all three regions. Indicator values showed that most highly abundant taxa occurred in all regions. However, several taxa were clearly identified as characteristic of particular regions.

Multiple regressions with data collected on 11 occasions on fixed back-reef and fore-reef sites suggested that the densities of the congener, other crevice-dwellers, and predators did not significantly affect the density of P. argus in either reef zone, or of P. guttatus on the back-reef, where coexistence of both lobster species was greatest. In contrast, there was a significant negative relationship between predators and the density of P. guttatus on the fore-reef, where this species was dominant. Congeneric cohabitation in dens was less than expected by chance, but this pattern may reflect a differential use of shelter resources rather than interspecific competition. P. guttatus was more prevalent in dens over the middle and upper third of the reef profile, and P. argus over the lower and middle third of the reef profile. Whether individuals cohabited with conspecifics, congeners, or resided solitarily, P. guttatus was more prevalent at the walls and/or ceiling and P. argus on the floor of dens.

Those experimental communities, however, had relatively few sponges and ascidians. In contrast, turbulent transport of particles into the momentum boundary layers can limit particle removal by layered, dense bivalve populations. In this study, the role of water velocity in controlling particulate nutrient-uptake by rubble communities was evaluated, in which the rubble was more completely covered by sponges and ascidians. Picoplankton uptake was proportional to concentration over a range of cell concentrations from 3.0 x 10(5) to 9.5 x 10(5) heterotrophic bacteria ml(-1,) 4.1 x 10(4) to 1.2 x 10(5) Synechococcus sp. ml(-1) and 6.3 x 10(3) to 1.8 x 10(4) picoeukaryotes ml(-1).

Picoplankton uptake increased 1.6-fold over a 7-fold change in water velocity, 0.05-0.35 m s(-1). This increase has been interpreted as a result of higher turbulent transport within the rough coral community (canopy), as indicated by a 1.6-fold increase in the bottom friction with increasing water velocity.","CSIC, CMIMA, Inst Ciencias Mar, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA",15,10.1007/s00338-007-0211-4,2007

Several laboratory choice-chamber experiments were conducted to explore sensory capabilities and behavioral responses to ecological stimuli to better understand habitat selection by ""pre-metamorphic"" (larval) and ""post-metamorphic"" (juvenile) stages of a coral reef fish (Thalassoma hardwicke). T. hardwicke larvae were attracted to benthic macroalgae (Turbinaria ornata and Sargassum mangarevasae), while slightly older post-metamorphosed juveniles chose to occupy live coral colonies (Pocillopora damicornis). Habitat choices of larvae were primarily based upon visual cues and were not influenced by the presence of older conspecifics. In contrast, juveniles selected live coral colonies and preferred those occupied by older conspecifics; choices made by juveniles were based upon both visual and olfactory cues from conspecifics. Overall, the laboratory experiments suggest that early life-history stages of T. hardwicke use a range of sensory modalities that vary through ontogeny, to effectively detect and possibly discriminate among different microhabitats for settlement and later occupation. Habitat selection, based upon cues provided by environmental features and/or by conspecifics, might have important consequences for subsequent competitive interactions.","Univ Perpignan, UR 128 CoReUs, Inst Rech Developpement, F-66860 Perpignan, France; Univ Ryukyus, Lab Ecol & Syst, Okinawa, Japan; Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington, New Zealand; Univ Perpignan, CNRS, UMR 5244, EPHE UPVD, F-66025 Perpignan, France",43,10.1007/s00338-007-0212-3,2007

This study assessed the potential grazing impact of individual species within an inshore herbivorous reef fish assemblage on the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR), by determining which fish species were able to remove particular macroalgal species. Transplanted multiple-choice algal assays and remote stationary underwater digital video cameras were used to quantify the impact of local herbivorous reef fish species on 12 species of macroalgae. Macroalgal removal by the fishes was rapid. Within 3 h of exposure to herbivorous reef fishes there was significant evidence of intense grazing. After 12 h of exposure, 10 of the 12 macroalgal species had decreased to less than 15% of their original mass. Chlorodesmis fastigiata (Chlorophyta) and Galaxaura sp. (Rhodophyta) showed significantly less susceptibility to herbivorous reef fish grazing than all other macroalgae, even after 24 h exposure. Six herbivorous and/or nominally herbivorous reef fish species were identified as the dominant grazers of macroalgae: Siganus doliatus, Siganus canaliculatus, Chlorurus microrhinos, Hipposcarus longiceps, Scarus rivulatus and Pomacanthus sexstriatus. The siganid S. doliatus fed heavily on Hypnea sp., while S. canaliculatus fed intensively on Sargassum sp. Variation in macroalgal susceptibility was not clearly correlated with morphological and/or chemical defenses that have been previously suggested as deterrents against herbivory. Nevertheless, the results stress the potential importance of individual herbivorous reef fish species in removing macroalgae from coral reefs.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",59,10.1007/s00338-007-0214-1,2007

On coral reefs, spring low tides are recurrent disturbances, but are rarely reported to cause mass mortality. However, in years when extremely low tides coincide with high noon irradiances, they have the potential to cause widespread damage. Here, we report on such an event on a fringing coral reef in the central Great Barrier Reef (Australia) in September 2005. Visual surveys of colony mortality and bleaching status of more than 13,000 corals at 14 reef sites indicated that most coral taxa at wave-protected sites were severely affected by the event. Between 40 and 75% of colonies in the major coral taxa (Acropora, Porites, Faviidae, Mussidae and Pocilloporidae) were either bleached or suffered partial mortality. In contrast, corals at wave-exposed sites were largely unaffected (< 1% of the corals were bleached), as periodic washing by waves prevented desiccation. Surveys along a 1-9 m depth gradient indicated that high coral mortality was confined to the tidal zone. However, 20-30% of faviid colonies were bleached throughout the depth range, suggesting that the increase in benthic irradiances during extreme low tides caused light stress in deeper water. Analyses of an 8-year dataset of tidal records for the area indicated that the combination of extended periods of aerial exposure and high irradiances occurs during May-September in most years, but that the event in September 2005 was the most severe. We argue that extreme low-tide, high-irradiance events are important structuring forces of intertidal coral reef communities, and can be as damaging as thermal stress events. Importantly, they occur at a time of year when risks from thermal stress, cyclones and monsoon-associated river run-off are minimal.","Univ Queensland, Ctr Marine Studies, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine Biol Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",42,10.1007/s00227-006-0573-0,2007

There were distinct differences between the two levels of exposure, which were consistent between locations. Habitat characteristics, measured on scales of tens of centimetres, explained 50% of the variability in assemblage structure between exposures, whereas 'exposure' alone (implying direct effects of wave energy on the fish) explained < 5% of the variation. The most important explanatory variables were the presence of macroalgae, sandy habitat and oyster shell, the last of which increased the degree of small-scale complexity and provided nesting sites for blennies. We found little evidence to suggest that wave action had large direct effects on the fish assemblages, although this may be in part due to the relatively small degree of difference between 'exposed' and 'sheltered' samples under the calm conditions of a sea with a relatively short fetch. These results suggest that wave action acts mainly indirectly as a structuring force on cryptic reef fish communities, by altering the composition and/or the relative density of epibiota that influence the distribution of fish. Thus, relative wave energy may provide a useful means of predicting fish assemblage structure only at large spatial scales. Microhabitat, composed of a combination of physical complexity and biological elements, always explained the greater part of variability at small (< 1 m) spatial scales.","Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Nelson, New Zealand; Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Biol Evoluz & Sperimentale, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; Univ Bologna, Ctr Interdipartimentale Ricerca Sci Ambientali Ra, I-48100 Ravenna, Italy",20,10.1007/s00227-006-0586-8,2007

Adults formed spawning aggregations of 150 to > 700 individuals at specific sites, and spawning occurred daily at these sites from late April through early June. Courtship occurred throughout the day, but spawning was restricted to the evening hours. Adults spawned in groups of 6-40 fish, and pair-spawning was not observed. The group-spawning behavior of adults and the gonosomatic indices of mature males (maximum = 7.2%) suggest that sperm competition was present. The site-specificity of leopard grouper spawning aggregations and diel spawning period were typical of most aggregating groupers, and the size and structure of these aggregations was similar to other species in the genus Mycteroperca. Leopard grouper behavior patterns were unusual in that spawning aggregations persisted for extended periods, spawning was not synchronized with the lunar cycle, and adults aggregated during non-spawning periods. The extensive duration and site-specificity of spawning aggregations and the propensity of M. rosacea to form aggregations year-round increases the vulnerability of the species to overfishing.

We provide data demonstrating that sympatric Hypoplectrus colour morphs mate assortatively and are genetically distinct. Furthermore, we identify ecological conditions conducive to disruptive selection on colour pattern by presenting behavioural evidence of aggressive mimicry, whereby predatory Hypoplectrus colour morphs mimic the colour patterns of non-predatory reef fish species to increase their success approaching and attacking prey.

Increased fish grazing, primarily driven by reduced fishing, was strongly negatively correlated with macroalgal cover and resulted in a 2-fold increase in the density of coral recruits within a Bahamian reef system. Our conclusions are robust because four alternative hypotheses that may generate a spurious correlation between grazing and coral recruitment were tested and rejected. Grazing appears to influence the density and community structure of coral recruits, but no detectable influence was found on the overall size-frequency distribution, community structure, or cover of corals. We interpret this absence of pattern in the adult coral community as symptomatic of the impact of a recent disturbance event that masks the recovery trajectories of individual reefs.

It is unclear whether the types of temporal patterns and the explanatory power of the adaptive hypotheses are applicable to damselfishes of temperate rocky reefs. This study tested hypotheses about the existence of lunar spawning cycles, the diel timing of hatching, and the synchronization of temporal patterns in hatching and tides in the schooling planktivorous damselfish Chromis hypsilepis on a rocky reef in New South Wales, Australia. Reproductive behaviour was observed daily for 223 days between August 2004 and March 2005. C. hypsilepis formed large spawning aggregations of 3,575-33,075 individuals. Spawning occurred at a uniform rate throughout the day on a semi-lunar cycle. The greatest number of spawnings occurred 1 day after the new moon and 1 day before the full moon. The cost to males from brood care was an 85% reduction in their feeding rate. The semi-lunar spawning cycle may be an outcome of the use of the lunar cue to synchronize the aggregation for spawning of widely dispersed individuals and the need for males to recuperate after brooding. Eggs hatched 3-7 h after sunset following a 4.5-day incubation period. This study provides no support for hypotheses that link temporal patterns in hatching with particular tidal regimes believed to facilitate early survival of larvae and their dispersal. The result that hatching occurred over the tidal cycle was due to the rapid off-reef dispersal of larvae from the spawning ground at all stages of the tide. C. hypsilepis is similar to other planktivorous damselfishes in its semi-lunar spawning cycle, cost of brood care, and protracted diel spawning regime. It differs in its lengthy period of hatching and its breeding in spawning aggregations, believed to be rare among demersally spawning fishes.","Univ Newcastle, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Ourimbah, NSW 2258, Australia",19,10.1007/s00227-006-0555-2,2007

Larvae present at the surface were significantly smaller than at the bottom. For some of the most abundant species found at the bottom, only small larvae occurred at the surface while the whole range of sizes was present at the bottom, indicating that larvae may be completing the entire pelagic phase near the adults' habitat.

However, little is known about the mechanisms stabilizing social queues given the inevitable conflict over rank between group members. Here, we report the role of punishment and cooperation in promoting the stability of size-based queues in a coral-dwelling goby, Paragobiodon xanthosomus (Gobiidae). Quantitative analysis of the size-structure of queues revealed that individuals of adjacent rank differ in size by a specific size ratio, and comparisons of individual growth rates within queues demonstrated that specific size ratios are maintained over time via the regulation of subordinate growth rates. Furthermore, contest experiments demonstrated that the specific size ratio represents a threshold above which the subordinates become a threat to their immediate dominant, and as a result, dominants evict subordinates that exceed this size ratio from the group. We propose that threshold size ratios are maintained by subordinates as a form of peaceful cooperation whereby they avoid inflicting costs on dominants, and that such cooperation arises in response to the threat of punishment in the form of eviction by dominants. Societal stability is therefore achieved through the effects of punishment and cooperation acting in concert to promote the resolution of conflict over rank between group members.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ N Queensland, ARC, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; CSIC, Integrat Ecol Grp, Estac Biol Donana, Seville 41013, Spain",87,10.1098/rspb.2006.0284,2007

For the first time we quantify the localized impact of the LRFT. We collected data from three LRFT traders in northern Borneo, which yielded information on daily fishing effort and the species and mass of all fishes sold every day by individual fishers or vessels over 2, 3 and 8 years. Total monthly catch and relative abundance ( catch-per-unit-effort) declined significantly in several species, including the most valuable species the Napoleon wrasse ( Cheilinus undulatus, estimated changes of -98 and -78% over 8 years in catch and relative abundance, respectively) and lower-value bluelined groupers ( Plectropomus oligocanthus: -99 and -81%) and Epinephelus groupers ( -89 and -32%). These severe declines were rapid, species-specific and occurred in the first 2 - 4 years of the dataset and are, we believe, directly attributable to the LRFT. This has crucial implications for future data collection and monitoring if population collapses in other parts of the LRFT and similar wildlife trades are to be successfully detected.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England",22,10.1098/rspb.2006.0280,2007

Rates of metabolism of algal turfs are related positively to water motion, consistent with limitation by the diffusion of a substance through a boundary layer. Based on engineering mass transfer theory, we hypothesized that photosynthesis of algal turfs is controlled by rates of mass transfer and responses of photosynthesis to increasing flow speed should be predicted by engineering correlations. This hypothesis was tested in ten experiments where photosynthesis was estimated in a flume/respirometer from changes in dissolved oxygen at eight flow speeds between 0.08 and 0.52 m/s. Flow in the flume and over the reef at Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii was estimated using hot-film thermistor and electromagnetic current meters. Rates of photosynthesis were related positively to flow in all experiments and plots of the log of the average Sherwood number (Sh (meas)) versus log Reynolds number (Re (D)) for each experiment are lower than predicted for mass transfer through a turbulent boundary layer. Algal turf-covered plates are characterized as hydrodynamically transitional to fully rough surfaces and the lower than predicted slopes suggest that roughness reduces rates of mass transfer. A negative correlation between algal turf biomass and slopes of the log Sh (meas)-log Re (D) plots suggests that mass transfer to algal turfs is affected significantly by the physical structure of the algal community. Patterns of photosynthesis based on changes in dissolved oxygen and dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations (DIC) indicate that the flow speed effect is not the result of increased flux of oxygen from the algal turfs, and combined with the short response time to flow speed, suggest that DIC may limit rates of photosynthesis. Although there are differences between flow in the flume and flow over algal turfs on the reef, these results suggest that photosynthesis is controlled, at least in part, by mass transfer. The chemical engineering approach provides a framework to pose further testable hypotheses about how algal canopy height, flow oscillation, turbulence, and substratum roughness may modulate rates of metabolism of coral reef algal turfs.","Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA",39,10.1007/s00227-006-0465-3,2007

Larvae and juveniles of three coral reef fish species (Pomacentrus amboinensis, Premnas biaculeatus and Apogon compressus) are able to feed successfully using UV-A radiation alone during the later half of the pelagic larval phase. The minimum UV radiation intensities required for larval feeding occur in the field down to depths of 90-130 m in oceanic waters and 15-20 m in turbid inshore waters. There was no abrupt change in UV sensitivity after settlement, indicating that UV photosensitivity may continue to play a significant role in benthic juveniles on coral reefs. Tests of UV sensitivity in the field using light traps indicate that larval and juvenile stages of 16 coral reef fish families are able to detect and respond photopositively to UV wavelengths. These include representatives from families that are unlikely to possess UV sensitivity as adults due to the UV transmission characteristics of the ocular media. Functional UV sensitivity may be more widespread in young coral reef fishes than in the adults, and may play a significant role in detecting zooplanktonic prey.","TAFEWA Kimberley Coll, Broome Aquaculture Ctr, Broome, WA 6725, Australia; James Cook Univ N Queensland, Dept Marine Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",12,10.1007/s00227-006-0482-2,2007

An alternative method revealed that in New Caledonia, eels are far more abundant and diverse than previously suspected. We analysed the stomach contents of two species of sea snakes that feed on eels (Laticauda laticaudata and L. saintgironsi). This technique is feasible because the snakes return to land to digest their prey, and (since they swallow their prey whole) undigested food items are identifiable. The snakes' diet consisted almost entirely (99.6%) of eels and included 14 species previously unrecorded from the area. Very large populations of snakes occur in the study area (e.g. at least 1,500 individuals on a small coral islet).

For the same study period, numerical simulations of the current were also performed using a shallow water turbulent flow model with high accuracy reef bathymetry data, which were estimated from high-resolution imagery obtained from satellite remote sensing. The numerical simulation results showed good agreement with the observed data and revealed that the currents have an appreciable magnitude of tide-averaged velocities, even during neap tides, which are governed mostly by wave set-up effects. The results also indicated that temporal variations in velocity and water surface elevation during a tide cycle in the reef exhibit highly asymmetrical patterns; in spring tides especially, the velocities around channels indicate rapid transitions over a short period from peak ebb flow to peak flood flow. The simulations also indicated that a big channel penetrating deeply into the reef attracts the tide-averaged mean flow, even from distant areas of the reef.","Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Climate Variat Res Program, Frontier Res Ctr Global Change, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; Tokyo Inst Technol, Grad Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Dept Mech & Environm Informat, Tokyo 1528552, Japan; Univ Philippines diliman, Coll Engn, Dept Geodet Engn, Quezon City 1101, Philippines",24,10.1007/s00338-006-0164-z,2007

The log-log-transformed SPAR of coral reef fishes on small patch-reefs revealed a steep slope of 0.55. However, this slope was dependent on the cumulative area of the reef examined and was therefore affected by random placement. After statistically removing the contribution of random placement from the SPAR, the slope was estimated to be 0.21. This is consistent with estimates from other, mostly terrestrial, systems. Furthermore, a randomization procedure, where the probability of fishes to reach a patch was proportional to reef area, showed that the field measured SPAR did not differ from random placement. In addition, fish assemblages on species poor reefs did not form subsets of species rich reefs (i.e., no nestedness) beyond that expected from random placement. Steep log-log-transformed SPARs can be formed by random placement alone, indicating that caution should be used when assigning an ecological meaning to SPARs generated from small spatial scales.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; Interuniv Inst Marine Sci, H Steinitz Marine Biol Lab, IL-88103 Elat, Israel; Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Evolut Syst & Ecol, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel",15,10.1007/s00338-006-0162-1,2007

Gross carbonate production (GCP) was dominated by scleractinians (97%), particularly by sediment-resistant species, e.g. Diploria strigosa on the reef flat (< 2 m). Calcareous encrusters contributed very little carbonate. Total bioerosion removed 265 g CaCO3 m(-2) year(-1) and was dominated by microborers.

The study demonstrates that: (1) carbonate production and net reef accretion can occur where environmental conditions approach or exceed perceived threshold levels for coral survival; and (2) although live coral cover (and carbonate production rates) were reduced on reef-front sites along the North Jamaican coast, low population densities of grazing fish and echinoids to some extent offset this, thus maintaining positive carbonate budgets.","Univ W Indies, Dept Life Sci, St Augustine, Trinid & Tobago; Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, Manchester M1 5GD, Lancs, England",52,10.1007/s00338-006-0169-7,2007

Female fish were found to be regressed from mid-summer to early spring, after which rapid and cyclical increases in gonado-somatic index (I (G)), maximum oocyte diameter (MOD) and plasma concentrations of estradiol-17 beta and testosterone were detected. Male fish, in contrast, commenced recrudescence slightly earlier in winter and responded with less dramatic increases in both I (G) and plasma concentrations of testosterone and 11-ketotestosterone. The mode of oocyte development was multiple group-synchronous, and cyclical fluctuations in reproductive parameters (I (G), MOD and gonadal steroid concentrations) were synchronized with new-moon lunar phases. It is likely, therefore, that individual P. leopardus have the capacity to spawn on multiple occasions, with lunar periodicity. However, evidence suggests that early bouts of reproduction may be more important in terms of reproductive investment than subsequent bouts later in the same season. It is concluded that patterns of gametogenesis and steroidogenesis in P. leopardus are similar to the patterns displayed by other tropical groupers, suggesting that management regimes and propagation protocols developed for these fishes may also be appropriate for use with P. leopardus.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ N Queensland, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ N Queensland, Fac Sci Engn & Informat Technol, Fish Endocrinol Lab, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",15,10.1007/s00338-006-0183-9,2007

Specific relationships were functionally consistent with the ecology of the fishes of interest. For example, reefs with large amounts of seagrass nearby harbored the greatest numerical abundance of fishes, particularly mobile invertebrate feeders and the exploited fish families of Haemulidae (grunts) and Lutjanidae (snappers). Species richness for the entire fish community and within these fish groups was also strongly associated with reef context. Furthermore, reef fish mobility influenced how fishes related to reef context. Fish-habitat relationships were detected as far as 1 km from study reefs, suggesting that fish movements result in habitat encounter rates that may influence their patterns of distribution.

Cytochrome-c oxidase I sequences from tissue samples were used to characterize population structure and infer patterns of gene flow from California to Alaska. No significant genetic structure was found when estimates of Wright's F-ST (i.e., Phi(ST)) were generated among all populations sampled. Nesting populations within regions, however, indicated that the inner coast of Washington State is distinct, a result corroborating previous allozyme work. Coalescent-based estimates of gene flow indicate that although migration can be high from an evolutionary perspective, nearly half of all comparisons among populations showed no gene flow in at least one direction. From an ecological perspective, moderate migration rates (Nm < 10) among most populations provide surprisingly limited connectivity at large (similar to 1,000 km) and small (similar to 100 km) spatial scales. Coalescent-based estimates also show that gene flow between the inner and the outer coasts is asymmetric, a result consistent with prevailing surface currents. Because the expected inter-locus variances for coalescent-based estimates of gene flow are likely large, future work will benefit from analyses of nuclear DNA markers. However, limited demographic connectivity on large spatial scales may help explain why stock recovery has been uneven, with greater recovery in the northern (87% rebuilt) than in the southern (24% rebuilt) fishery region, supporting a regional management strategy. These results suggest that despite a 3-month pelagic larval stage, some areas may be effectively closed with respect to both population dynamics and fishery management issues.","Univ Calif Davis, Bodega Marine Lab, Calif Dept Fish & Game, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA; Univ N Carolina, Dept Marine Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",19,10.1007/s00227-006-0395-0,2007

This supports the hypothesis that the configuration of mutualistic interactions will tend towards nestedness. In this case, the structure of the interaction is at a much larger scale than previously hypothesized, across more than 180 degrees of longitude and some 60 degrees of latitude, probably owing to the pelagic dispersal capabilities of these species in a marine environment. Additionally, we found weak support for the hypothesis that geographically widespread species should be more generalized in their interactions than species with small ranges. This study extends understanding of the structure of mutualistic relationships into previously unexplored taxonomic and physical realms, and suggests how nestedness analysis can be applied to the conservation of obligate species interactions.","Univ Northampton, Landscape & Biodivers Res Grp, Sch Appl Sci, Northampton NN2 7AL, England; Univ Kansas, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol & Nat Hist Museum, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; Univ Kansas, Biodivers Res Ctr, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; Western Australian Museum, Dept Aquat Zool, Perth, WA 6986, Australia",70,10.1098/rspb.2006.3758,2007

They, and other isopods, have been shown to significantly affect the health and behaviour of many reef fish. Whether isopod emergence differs among habitats on coral reefs is not known. In this study, we measured emergence rates of parasitic isopods (Gnathiidea and Flabellifera) in six habitats at two sites at Lizard Island during new moon periods in March and December 2004. Isopods were collected from the periphery and centres of micro-reefs, patch reefs, continuous reefs, and from inter-reefal habitats (sand or rubble) with 1 m(2) emergence traps. Sites (Casuarina and Coconut Beach) were located on opposite sides of Lizard Island. Live gnathiids were collected with light traps in November 2005 to investigate species differences between sites. At both sites, the most abundant gnathiid species was exclusive to that site. More gnathiid larvae emerged at night, and emergence of fed gnathiids (pranizae) and flabelliferan isopods was almost exclusively nocturnal. Diurnal emergence was greater at Coconut Beach than Casuarina Beach. Although emergence counts were not consistently affected by parameters such as habitat, site, or sampling period, gnathiid size and feeding state were. Where significant differences existed, gnathiids were larger and more often fed over reef borders than centrally. We suggest first stage larvae (Z1) have the largest influence on total abundance and are patchily distributed in accordance with adults from which they have recently hatched. As later stage larvae depend on fish, more successful (fed) and older larvae are found on the edges of reefs where appropriate hosts may be more abundant, or predation is lower. Gnathiids were over-dispersed in all habitats investigated, including apparently homogeneous beds of coral rubble and sand. This indicates that their distributions may be better predicted by very fine scale differences in substrate or that aggregations are the result of gregariousness and may be difficult to predict on the basis of substrate. Emergence traps collected comparatively few parasitic flabelliferan isopods. This community differed greatly from the previously described community of scavenging isopods at Lizard Island. These differences are probably the result of differences in trapping methodology.","Univ Queensland, Sch Integrat Biol, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",25,10.1007/s00227-006-0416-z,2007

At low tide when fish cannot occupy mangroves they might utilise adjacent habitats, including seagrass. We first sampled small fish from seagrass beds close to and far from mangroves in the Pittwater estuary, NSW, Australia. Seagrass beds close to mangroves had a greater density of fish species than beds far from mangroves (close: mean 16.0 species net(-1), SE 1.0; far: 13.2, 1.3; P < 0.05). In particular, juvenile fish were in greater densities near to than far from mangroves (close: 5.3, 0.4; far: 3.1, 0.4; P < 0.05). We then sampled the mangrove forests during the high tide and seagrass beds during the low tide, in beds along a continuum of distances from mangroves. Multivariate analysis showed that fish assemblages differed with distance from mangroves, and the differences were attributed to the composition of the fish assemblage (i.e. presence/absence of fish species), not the abundances of individual species. In particular, fish that utilise mangrove forests at high tide were found in greater species densities and species richness in seagrass nearer to mangroves. A negative relationship was found between the density of mangrove-utilising fish species and the distance of the bed from mangroves (R-2 = 0.37, P < 0.05). This confirms the important connectivity between mangroves and seagrass for fish in temperate Australian waters.","NSW Dept Environm & Conservat, Sydney S, NSW 1232, Australia; Univ Western Sydney, Sch Nat Sci, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia; Griffith Univ, Ctr Aquat Proc & Pollut, Brisbane, Qld 9726, Australia; Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Appl Sci, Gold Coast Mail Ctr, Brisbane, Qld 9726, Australia",55,10.1007/s00227-006-0419-9,2007

The planktonic nature of the early larval stages suggests a passive dispersal model where ocean currents would quickly cause panmixis over large spatial scales and prevent isolation of populations, a prerequisite for speciation. However, high biodiversity and species abundance in coral reefs contradict this panmixis hypothesis. Although ocean currents are a major force in larval dispersal, recent studies show far greater retention than predicted by advection models. We investigated the role of animal behavior in retention and homing of coral reef fish larvae resulting in two important discoveries: (i) Settling larvae are capable of olfactory discrimination and prefer the odor of their home reef, thereby demonstrating to us that nearby reefs smell different. (ii) Whereas one species showed panmixis as predicted from our advection model, another species showed significant genetic population substructure suggestive of strong homing. Thus, the smell of reefs could allow larvae to choose currents that return them to reefs in general and natal reefs in particular. As a consequence, reef populations can develop genetic differences that might lead to reproductive isolation.","Marine Biol Lab, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; Boston Univ, Marine Program, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; Artificial Surf Reef Ltd, Raglan, New Zealand",270,10.1073/pnas.0606777104,2007

By testing two damselfishes, Chromis atripectoralis and Pomacentrus amboinensis, we show that the high swimming speeds of the pre-settlement larvae are accompanied by the highest rates of oxygen uptake ever recorded in ectothermic vertebrates. As expected, these high rates of oxygen uptake occur at the cost of poor hypoxia tolerance. However, hypoxia tolerance is needed when coral reef fishes seek nocturnal shelter from predators within coral colonies, which can become severely hypoxic microhabitats at night. When the larvae settle on the reef, we found that they go through a striking respiratory transformation, i.e. the capacity for rapid oxygen uptake falls, while the ability for high-affinity oxygen uptake at low oxygen levels is increased. This transition to hypoxia tolerance is needed when they settle on the reef; this was strengthened by our finding that small resident larvae of Acanthochromis polyacanthus, a damselfish lacking a planktonic larval stage, do not display such a transition, being well adapted to hypoxia and showing relatively low maximum rates of oxygen uptake that change little with age.","Univ Oslo, Dept Mol Biosci, Phys Programme, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; Univ Queensland, Sch Integrat Biol, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia",45,10.1098/rspb.2006.3706,2007

During the summers of 2000, 2001 and 2004, two small calanoid species, Temora turbinata Dana, 1849 and Paracalanus parvus Claus, 1863 were exposed to a visual predatory fish, the blenny Acanthemblemaria spinosa Metzelaar, 1919, and their predator-prey interactions were recorded using both high-speed and standard videographic techniques. Copepod escape reaction components, including swimming pattern, reactive distance, turning rate, and jump kinetics, were quantified from individual predation events using motion analysis techniques. Among the observed escape reaction components, differences were noted between the species' swimming patterns prior to attack and their response latencies. Temora turbinata was a continuous cruiser and P. parvus exhibited a hop-and-sink swimming pattern. During periods of sinking, P. parvus stopped beating its appendages, which presumably reduced any self-generated hydrodynamic signals and increased perceptual abilities to detect an approaching predator. Response latency was determined for each copepod species using a hydrodynamic stimulus produced by a 1 ms acoustic signal. Response latencies of T. turbinata were significantly longer than those of P. parvus. Despite some apparent perceptual advantages of P. parvus, the blenny successfully captured both species by modifying its attack behavior for the targeted prey.","Univ Texas, Inst Marine Sci, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USA",31,10.1007/s00227-006-0384-3,2007

We examined 113 individuals from eight locations across the Indo-Pacific Ocean. Our aims were to determine the spatial scale at which population partitioning occurred and then to evaluate the extent to which either vicariance and/or dispersal events have shaped the population structure of N. vlamingii. The analysis produced several unexpected findings. Firstly, the genetic structure of this species was temporal rather than spatial. Secondly, there was no evidence of a barrier to dispersal throughout the vast distribution range. Apparently larvae of this species traverse vicariance barriers that inhibit inter-oceanic migration of other widespread reef fish taxa. Thirdly, an unusual life history and long evolutionary history was associated with a population structure that was unique amongst coral reef fishes in terms of the magnitude and pattern of genetic diversity (haplotype diversity, h = 1.0 and nucleotide diversity pi = 13.6%). In addition to these unique characteristics, there was no evidence of isolation by distance (r = 0.458, R-2 = 0.210, P = 0.078) as has also been shown for some other widespread reef species. However, some reductions in gene flow were observed among and within Ocean basins [Indian-Pacific analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), Phi(st) = 0.0766, P < 0.05; West Indian-East Indian-Pacific AMOVA Phi(st) = 0.079, P < 0.05]. These findings are contrasted with recent studies of coral reef fishes that imply a greater degree of spatial structuring in coral reef fish populations than would be expected from the dispersive nature of their life cycles.

A total of 97 taxa belonging to 7 orders and 26 familis were captured in three bays near Noumea by light trapping every month between January 2002 and June 2003. The assemblages were dominated by Clupeiform larvae and juveniles (96.4% of total abundance) and followed by Perciform larvae (3%). The number of taxa per sample varied from less than five in July-August to more than ten in October-November and abundances followed the same seasonal pattern. Analyses of similarity showed significant differences in the assemblages caught in the three bays and analyses of contribution to the dissimilarity revealed that these differences were due to the most abundant families. The constant part of the relationship between environmental variables and the composition of assemblages was assessed by the partial triadic analysis STATICO, a statistical approach that takes into account the strong seasonality of the data. Rainfall, wind direction and thermal stratification of the water column were found to play a major role in the structure of the assemblages, although tidal amplitude and wind speed became important when Clupeidae and Engraulididae were excluded from the analyses. The richness, relative abundances and seasonal variations of the assemblages caught in three bays under study are close to what has been observed elsewhere in the tropics. This study shows the efficiency of the STATICO analysis for identifying the environmental factors that have a permanent effect on assemblages and sorting them out from those which act temporally or on specific locations. The high abundances and diversity of coral-reef fish larvae observed in coastal zones of New Caledonia suggest that further studies are needed to fully explore the role of the coastal zones of New Caledonia as nurseries.","IRD, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia",23,10.1007/s00227-006-0389-y,2007

When aerosol levels are low, bleaching is largely determined by El Nino strength, but high aerosol levels mitigate the effects of a severe El Nino. High aerosol levels, resulting principally from recent volcanic activity, have thus protected Caribbean reefs from more frequent widespread bleaching events but cannot be relied on to provide similar protection in the future.","Univ E Anglia, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Conservat, Sch Biol Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; Univ E Anglia, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",10,10.1073/pnas.0608470103,2006

In some sex-changing fishes, the testes of primary males appear anatomically similar to those of non-sex-changing species, whereas the testes of secondary males have anatomical evidence of their former ovarian function. Here, we provide evidence that in the bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum, these strikingly different male phenotypes arise from differences in the ontogenetic timing of environmental sex determination, timing that can be experimentally altered through changes in the social circumstances. Juveniles differentiated almost exclusively as females when reared in isolation, regardless of whether they were collected from a reef with a high proportion of primary males or from a reef with a low proportion of primary males. In contrast, one individual usually differentiated as a primary male when reared in groups of three.

This study demonstrates the importance of an association with trapeziid crabs in reducing adverse effects of sediments deposited on corals. In a field experiment, mortality rates of two species of branching corals were significantly lowered by the presence of crabs. All outplanted corals with crabs survived whereas 45-80% of corals without crabs died within a month. For surviving corals that lacked crabs, growth was slower and tissue bleaching and sediment load were higher. Laboratory experiments revealed that corals with crabs shed substantially more of the sediments deposited on coral surfaces, but also that crabs were most effective at removing grain sizes that were most damaging to coral tissues. The mechanism underlying this symbiotic relationship has not been recognized previously, and its role in maintaining coral health is likely to become even more critical as reefs worldwide experience increasing sedimentation.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Coastal Res Ctr, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",57,10.1007/s00338-006-0132-7,2006

Preferences for different cyanobacteria varied. Field surveys of cyanobacteria-associated species yielded 34 different invertebrate taxa and suggested different degrees of specificity in these associations.

Using an historic record of hourly wind conditions, a depth profile and two rigorously tested oceanographic models, 37-years of hourly wave driven water motion were hindcast spatially on a typical subtidal coral reef platform (maximum horizontal displacement, velocity and acceleration per wave cycle). For larger waves, those likely to constitute ecological disturbances, around 95% of the wave's height that is lost over the whole reef occurs within the first 50 m of the crest. The field-validated model of spatiotemporal variation in water motion provided a framework for quantitatively predicting several physiological and ecological effects of wave motion, such as nutrient and gas fluxes and mortality rates from hydrodynamic disturbances. It also suggested a sharp ecological transition between a crest habitat in which disturbance-mediated coexistence mechanisms are important, and a flat habitat in which they are much less important.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA; ASR Ltd, Raglan 2051, New Zealand",39,10.1007/s00338-006-0137-2,2006

This paper documents fish recruitment over a 2.5-year period in Kimbe Bay (PNG) and shows that it is much less seasonal than is typically described for higher latitude coral reefs. Two families, wrasses (Labridae) and damselfishes (Pomacentridae), which accounted for 90% of all non-cryptic reef fish settlers, exhibited contrasting patterns. Most wrasse species had year-round recruitment with irregular peaks in abundance between November and May. Damselfish species showed a wider range of recruitment patterns, but most had negligible recruitment during the wet season (December-February), followed by one or two recruitment peaks between May and November. Species with longer seasonal recruitment periods exhibited higher cumulative levels of recruitment. For three focal damselfish species, reproductive output was reduced during the wet season, but this alone did not account for the low recruitment at this time. The lack of damselfish recruitment during the wet season is hypothesised to be due to a combination of reduced reproductive output and increased larval mortality associated with monsoonal conditions.

To evaluate the concept of population connectivity in corals, we tested whether broadcast spawning reproduction per se confers the same degree of dispersal to two sister species, Montastraea annularis (Anthozoa: Scleractinia; Ellis and Solander 1786) and M. faveolata (Ellis and Solander 1786), both dominant taxa in reefs of the northern Caribbean. Genetic analyses of ten nuclear DNA loci (seven microsatellite and three single-copy RFLP) reveal strikingly different patterns of population genetic subdivision for these closely related, sympatric species, in spite of likely identical dispersal abilities. Strong population genetic structure typified the architecture of M. annularis, whereas M. faveolata populations were principally genetically well mixed. A higher level of clonality was observed in M. annularis potentially because of a susceptibility to physical fragmentation. Clonality did not, however, significantly contribute to population genetic structure or low-level Hardy-Weinberg and linkage disequilibria observed in some populations. The lack of consistent association between reproductive mode and dispersal reinforces the perspective that population connectivity is not so much a function of predictable marine population source and sink relationships as is due to a more complex interface of oceanic currents interacting with and amplifying stochastic fluctuations in larval supply and settlement success. Our results support others promoting an overall ecosystem approach in marine protected area design.","Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; Univ S Florida, Dept Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA",59,10.1007/s00227-006-0332-2,2006

We studied the effect of habitat type, fish size, social mode and time of day on resting and feeding behaviour of large juvenile (5-10 cm) and sub-adult (10-15 cm) Haemulon flavolineatum in mangroves and seagrass beds during daytime. Sub-adults occurred in mangroves only, spent most time on resting, and showed rare opportunistic feeding events (concordant with strategy 1), regardless of their social mode (solitary or schooling). In contrast, large juveniles were present in both habitat types and solitary fishes mainly foraged, while schooling fishes mainly rested. Exceptions were small juveniles (+/- 5 cm) in seagrass beds which foraged intensively while schooling. Large juveniles showed more feeding activity in seagrass beds than in mangroves. In both habitat types, they showed benthic feeding, whereas pelagic feeding was observed almost exclusively in the seagrass beds. In both habitat types, their feeding activity was highest during 8:00-10:30 hours (concordant with strategy 3), and for seagrass fishes, it was also high during 17:30-18:30 hours (concordant with strategy 2).

However, the magnitude of this challenge, particularly in marine environments, is not well known. In this study, we apply DNA barcoding to explore the biodiversity of gonodactylid stomatopods (mantis shrimp) in both the Coral Triangle and the Red Sea. Comparison of sequences from 189 unknown stomatopod larvae to 327 known adults representing 67 taxa in the superfamily Gonodactyloidea revealed 22 distinct larval operational taxonomic units (OTUs). In the Western Pacific, 10 larval OTUs were members of the Gonodactylidae and Protosquillidae where success of positive identification was expected to be 96.5%. However, only five OTUs could be identified to species and at least three OTUs represent new species unknown in their adult form. In the Red Sea where the identification rate was expected to be 75% in the Gonoclactylidae, none of four larval OTUs could be identified to species; at least two represent new species unknown in their adult forms.

Although it is common in many algae, reports of DMSP in animals, particularly tropical invertebrates, are limited. This study examined the distribution of DMSP in a diverse group of coral reef invertebrates. DMSP was present in all 22 species of cnidarians and ranged from 9 to 723 mu mol g(-1) of dry mass (DM) with a mean (+/- 1SD) of 110 +/- 180 mu mol g(-1) DM. It was not detected in a flatworm and an ascidian or in two of five sponges. Concentrations in sponges ranged from undetectable to 16 mu mol g(-1) DM with a mean of 4 +/- 7 mu mol g(-1) DM. Within the cnidarians, DMSP concentrations did not differ among orders. Among cnidarian species, DMSP concentrations were correlated with symbiotic zooxanthellae densities. Within cnidarian species, DMSP concentrations of individuals were positively correlated with zooxanthellae densities in three of the four species examined. We speculate that DMSP is dietarily derived in sponges and derived from zooxanthellae in the cnidarians. The functions of DMSP in coral reef invertebrates are not known.","Western Washington Univ, Shannon Point Marine Ctr, Anacortes, WA 98221 USA; Univ Guam, Marine Lab, UOG Stn, Mangilao, GU 96913 USA; Univ Mississippi, Dept Pharmacognosy, Oxford, MS 38677 USA",45,10.1007/s00338-006-0114-9,2006

On the reef flat, canopy and foliose algae dominated in winter, retaining low biomass in summer. On the fore reef, crustose corallines accounted for most of the macroalgal biomass throughout the year. Turf algae contributed least to the total biomass in all reef zones; biomass peaks shifted from midsummer on the inner reef flat to winter in the deeper zones.

Recovery from infectious disease may increase if an individual can mount a defense before infection spreads throughout its body. If pathogens spread within an organism from an initial infection point, growth form-in conjunction with size-can influence the amount of time before all the tissue is diseased, and recovery precluded. A simple model of pathogen progression within individual sponges predicts that species with massive growth forms will be most susceptible to being overwhelmed by pathogen infection, and branching species will be most likely to recover. These predictions may help to explain the seemingly contradictory observations that branching species had the greatest prevalence of disease, and massive species the greatest rate of loss, in a monitored coral reef community. Disease may be observed disproportionately frequently in the organisms that are most likely to recover, resulting in underestimation, by standard monitoring procedures, of the effect of disease on losses from the community.","Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",11,10.1007/s00338-006-0110-0,2006

This study tracked changes to coral and other benthic elements in three atolls in the Lakshadweep from 2000 to 2003. The recovery of coral was highly site-specific, and appeared to be driven by differences in post-settlement survival of coral recruits, that were in turn, influenced by the local hydrodynamics of the atolls. Post bleaching recovery was highest on west-facing reefs, while recovery on east-facing reefs was very limited. However, no 'phase-shift' to macroalgal dominated reefs was evident. High herbivore pressures were perhaps the most important control of macroalgae. Five years after the mass mortality, the genera that showed the maximum gains represented a mix of different susceptibilities to bleaching, while some genera that were not particularly susceptible to bleaching showed significant declines. These results suggest that decline or recovery of coral is likely dependent on individual life history strategies, post-recruitment survival, and contingency.","Nat Conservat Fdn, Mysore 570002, Karnataka, India; James Cook Univ N Queensland, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; CRC Reef Res, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia",34,10.1007/s00338-006-0127-4,2006

Algal production rates, determined in situ with caged and uncaged experimental plates, were low (mean 1.05 g C m(-2) day(-1)) and similar among reef types. Algal consumption rates were estimated using two different models, a detailed model incorporating fish bite rates and algal yield-per-bite for one species extrapolated to a guild-wide value, and a general regression relating fish biomass to algal consumption. Algal consumption differed among reef types: a majority of algal production was consumed on offshore reefs (55-100%), whereas consumption on inshore patch reefs was 31-51 %. Spatial variation in algal consumption was driven by differences in herbivorous fish species composition, density, and size-structure among reef types. Algal consumption rates also varied temporally due to seasonal declines in bite rates and intermittent presence of large-bodied, vagile, schooling species. Spatial coherence of benthic community structure and temporal stability of algal turf over 3 years suggests that grazing intensity is currently sufficient to limit further spread of macroalgal cover on these low coral-cover reefs, but not to exclude it from the system.","Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Biol & Fisheries, Miami, FL 33149 USA",70,10.1007/s00338-006-0112-y,2006

However, because the otolith's edge and core represent different life stages, the deposition of elements may differ, thus complicating direct comparisons of edge and core chemistry to investigate connectivity. Here we present data from a field experiment in which otoliths from embryos (3 days post-fertilization) and juveniles of Stegastes partitus were collected at the same site and time, and chemically analyzed to assess whether elemental concentrations of otoliths vary ontogenetically. Separate multivariate analyses, each investigating the spatial/temporal variability in the chemistry of either embryo otoliths or the edges of juvenile otoliths, revealed significant differences, suggesting an environmental influence to the chemical signals of otoliths. A nested multivariate analysis assessing whether otolith chemistry varied with life history stage (i.e., ontogenetic variability) indicated that elemental concentrations of embryo otoliths were significantly greater than that of juvenile otolith edges. Specifically, embryo elemental concentrations of Mn, Zn, Sn, Ba, Ce, and Pb were between 2 and 163 times greater than those of the corresponding juvenile otoliths, and thus the environment was not the primary determinant of embryo otolith chemistry. Consequently, caution is warranted when interpreting environmental patterns of otolith cores, particularly when using them as a proxy for natal signatures.","Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natori, Miyagi 98112, Japan; Univ Windsor, Dept Biol Sci, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada; Univ Windsor, Great Lakes Inst Environm Res, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada",31,10.1007/s00227-006-0280-x,2006

Here we examine the relationship between PLD, genetic structure and genetic variability in geographically widespread and ecological generalist species from one coral reef fish family (Pomacentridae) that differs in mean larval duration by more than a month. The genetic structure was estimated in eight species using a mitochondrial molecular marker (D-loop) and in a sub-set of five species using nuclear molecular markers (ISSRs). Estimates of genetic differentiation were similar among species with pelagic larvae, but differed between molecular markers. The mtDNA indicated no structure in all species except one, while the ISSR indicated some structure between the sampling locations in all species. We detected a relationship between PLD and genetic structure using both markers. These relationships, however, were caused by a single species, Acanthochromis polyacanthus, which differs from all the other species examined here in lacking a larval phase. With this species excluded, there was no relationship between PLD and genetic structure using either marker despite a range of PLDs of more than 20 days. Genetic diversities were generally high in all species and did not differ significantly among species and locations. Nucleotide diversity and total heterozygosity were negatively related to maximum PLD but again these relationships were caused by A. polyacanthus and disappeared when this species was excluded. These genetic patterns are consistent with moderate gene flow among well-connected locations and indicate that at this phylogenetic level (i.e., within family) the duration of the pelagic larval phase is unrelated to the patterns of genetic differentiation.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia",82,10.1007/s00227-006-0276-6,2006

Genetic clustering analysis implemented without reference to geographic structure strongly suggested that a number of distinct genetic clusters existed among the 245 plants sampled in August in the years 1997-2001. Subsequent analysis showed that clustering was associated with geographically defined populations both among (km scale) and within (m scale) sampling sites. F (st) analysis of geographically defined populations revealed significant genetic differentiation among populations of plants as little as 5 m apart, evidence of genetic structuring at even smaller scales, and a sharp increase in F (st) across populations separated by up to 23 m. F (st) values were also high and approximately unchanging (F (st)=0.470) for populations separated by greater distances (up to 11 km), consistent with a scenario of rare dispersal by detached, floating plants carried by variable currents. The results corroborate natural history observations suggesting that P. palmaeformis has extremely short (1-3 m) spore dispersal distances, and indicate that the dynamics of sea palm populations are more affected by local processes than recruitment from distant populations.","Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",15,10.1007/s00227-006-0254-z,2006

Analysis of microsatellite DNA markers indicated that French grunt population structure may be characterized by overlapping populations throughout the Caribbean, influenced by independent population dynamics but with no fixed geographical boundaries. In addition, different spatial genetic patterns were found in different oceanographic regions. A second species, the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum), has a much longer pelagic larval duration than French grunts and showed no explicit spatial pattern of genetic variation. This finding is concordant with the hypothesis of a positive relationship between larval dispersal and duration in the plankton.

Transects at 9, 18, and 25-m depths were surveyed at two reef sites before and after heavy wave action driven by westerly monsoon winds. Communities differed significantly between sites and depths, but major changes in benthic community structure were associated with wave action driven by monsoon winds. A shift from cyanobacteria to crustose coralline algae (CCA) accounted for 44% of this change. Coral recruitment on Guam may be limited by substrate availability if cyanobacteria cover large areas of the reef at the time of settlement, and consequently recruitment may in part depend upon wave action from annual monsoon winds and tropical storms which remove cyanobacteria, thereby exposing underlying CCA and other substrate suitable for coral settlement.","CSIC, Ctr Adv Studies, CEAB, Blanes 17300, Girona, Spain; Smithsonian Marine Stn, Ft Pierce, FL 34949 USA; Florida Museum Nat Hist, Dept Malacol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",16,10.1007/s00338-005-0080-7,2006

This work examined algal swimming behaviour, host location and navigation capabilities under four conditions: (1) still water, (2) in still water with waterborne host attractants, (3) in flowing water, and (4) in flow with host attractants. Algae were capable of actively and effectively locating their host in still water as well as in flow. When in water containing host attractants, swimming became slower, motion patterns straighter and the direction of motion was mainly towards the host-even if this meant advancing upstream against flow velocities of up to 0.5 mm s(-1)supercript stop. Coral-algae encounter probability decreased the further downstream of the host algae were located, probably due to diffusion of the chemical signal.

With the first wave of the flooding tide, dense aggregations of these ophiuroids (up to 320 m(-2)) engage in a 1-2 min burst of surface-film feeding, vigorously sweeping the air-water interface and associated sea foam with the ventral surface of 2-4 arms. Suspension feeding (with arms extended in the water column) is the primary feeding mode throughout the rest of the tidal cycle (involving 25-65% of the population at a time), while bottom feeding (with arms extended along the substratum) is infrequent (< 10%). Field experiments showed that surface-film feeding is regulated by water depth and can be triggered by suspended particles. This feeding mode appears to be an adaptation to the intertidal habitat, enabling the ophiuroids to exploit a nutrient-rich surface film during a temporal refuge (low tide) from fish predation.

An allozyme analysis, involving 12 loci systems of 52 sponge individuals from a total of 13 Montastraea heads, found that no two sponges possessed identical multi-locus genotypes. Contrary to the pattern expected for fragmenting species, the incidence of clonality and asexual propagation at the population level was minimal.

The first task of this study, conducted along the shallow rocky reefs of Ustica, was to determine the species composition, diversity and relative density of the resident cryptobenthic fishes. Furthermore, we aimed to assess the effects of some macro- and microscale habitat characteristics on the distribution pattern of fishes. In particular, the effect of predator density was indirectly evaluated by comparing density data collected within and outside the integral reserve zone. Overall, 20 species belonging to Blenniidae, Gobiidae, Tripterygiidae, Scorpaenidae and Gobiesocidae were recorded. Gobius bucchichi, Scorpaena maderensis, Tripterygion delaisi, T. melanurus and T. tripteronotus were the numerically dominant and most common species. The effects of zone (i.e. of predator density), bottom type and depth on species richness, diversity and evenness were not significant. A greater total fish density was observed on stones compared with rocky cliff and plateau, but only in the shallowest depth range. At level of single species, G. bucchichi was more abundant inside than outside the integral reserve, but only on stones and at 0-2 m depth range. Density of G. bucchichi was generally higher on stones than on rocky cliffs or plateau and between 0 and 5 m depth, although these differences were not always significant. T. delaisi was conversely more abundant in the deepest stratum (7-10 m). Canonical analyses demonstrated that bottom type and depth influenced significantly the fish assemblage structure. The observed differences in the assemblage structure relied mainly upon the dominant species. T. tripteronotus was mainly associated with rocky plateau and the intermediate depth range (3-5 m), whereas S. maderensis, T. melanurus and Lipophrys trigloides inhabited preferentially the rocky cliffs. At microscale level, the habitat choice of the investigated species was almost entirely based on whether the substrate was either vegetated or composed of bare rock. T. delaisi and T. tripteronotus were associated with substrata covered by algae, whilst G. bucchichi, S. maderensis and T. melanurus preferred bare rock bottoms. In some species, the electivity indices for the less abundant type of cover, measured at different spatial scale, changed accordingly. For instance, the smaller the size of the sampled area, the higher was the intensity of the association between G. bucchichi and Anemonia viridis.","ICRAM, Ist Cent Ric Applicata Mare, I-00166 Rome, Italy",27,10.1007/s00227-005-0194-z,2006

Despite their phylogenetic closeness, both species have many different life-history traits that may partially explain their coexistence. However, even though both species may face the same predators, their defense mechanisms and antipredator strategies had not been compared. We compared the performance between species in 18 morphological and behavioral defense mechanisms commonly expressed by most spiny lobsters, including predator-avoidance mechanisms (activity schedule, sheltering behavior, delay to disturbance, and effect of conspecific damage-released scents on shelter choice) as well as antipredator mechanisms (body size, several parameters of the escape response and limb autospasy, clinging strength, antennal strength, and cooperative defense). As hypothesized, both species expressed all these defense mechanisms (except cooperative defense, shown only by P. argus), reflecting their phylogenetic closeness, but performed significantly differently in most, in accordance with their particular ontogenetic traits. Their comparative performance in individual defense mechanisms as well as the antipredator strategies displayed by groups of lobsters of each species in the presence of a common predator (the triggerfish Balistes vetula) showed that, in general, the defensive behavioral type of P. argus is more bold and that of P. guttatus more shy. Therefore, their distinct defensive behaviors contribute to their niche differentiation.","Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Unidad Acad Puerto Morelos, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Cancun 77500, QR, Mexico",30,10.1007/s00227-005-0191-2,2006

Pachygrapsus crassipes, Portunus xantusii, Cancer spp., Hemigrapsus spp., and Majid crab megalopae dominated the catch. Yearly, seasonal, and daily variations in the magnitude of the catch were observed. Yearly and seasonal variations were probably due to a strong El Nino event that occurred during the study and to the timing of spawning and duration of the larval phase, respectively. Daily variation was correlated with oceanographic processes that can transport larvae to shore. Catch of some taxon during some seasons correlated with wind stress suggesting that transport was wind driven. The correlations were, however, weak and the sign of the correlation varied between years. The maximum daily tidal range was significantly correlated (cross-correlations and cross Fourier analysis) to both daily seawater temperature anomalies (surface and bottom) and daily catch of crab megalopae in all taxa enumerated. Significant correlations between tidal range and temperature anomalies suggest that temperature anomalies were primarily due to the shoreward transport of warm and cold water by the internal tides. The consistent and relatively strong relationship between tidal range and catch of megalopae (the cross-Fourier analysis suggests that from 20 to > 90% of the variation in catch can be attributed to variation in the tidal range) suggest that much of the shoreward transport of megalopae was via the internal tides. Shoreward transport of larvae by internal tides may be due to internal cold bores or convergences over large tidally generated internal waves (solitons). Peak catches of megalopae, however, were often not associated with cold anomalies suggesting that transport was due to moving convergences over internal waves.","Univ Oregon, Oregon Inst Marine Biol, Charleston, OR 97420 USA",34,10.1007/s00227-005-0162-7,2006

The bacterioplankton removal rate in cavities increased with increasing water exchange rates up to a threshold of 0.0045 s(-1), reaching values of 50-100 mg C m(-2) total interior cavity surface area (CSA) per day. Beyond the threshold, bacterioplankton removal dropped. The cryptic community is apparently adapted to the average water exchange in these cavities (0.0041 s(-1)). Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), nitrate + nitrite (NO (x) ) in particular, accumulated in cavity water and the accumulation decreased with increasing water exchange. Net NO (x) effluxes exceeded net DIN effluxes from cavities (average efflux rate of 1.9 mmol NO (x) vs. 0.8 mmol DIN m(-2) interior CSA per day). The difference is ascribed to net ammonium losses (NH4) in cavities at reef concentrations > 0.025 mu M NH4, possibly due to enhanced nitrification. Dissolved inorganic phosphate accumulated in cavities, but was not related to water exchange. The cryptic biota in cavities depend on water exchange for optimization of consumption of bacterioplankton and removal of inorganic nitrogen.

We examined the hypothesis that water motion increases the efflux of oxygen from coral tissue thereby reducing oxidative stress on the photosynthetic apparatus of endosymbiotic zooxanthellae. We experimentally exposed colonies of Montastrea annularis and Agaricia agaricites to manipulations of water flow, light intensity, and oxygen concentration in the field using a novel mini-flume. We measured photosynthetic efficiency using a pulse amplitude modulated fluorometer to test the short-term response of corals to our manipulations. Under normal oxygen concentrations, A. agaricites showed a significant 8% increase in photosynthetic efficiency from 0.238 (+/- 0.032) in still water to 0.256 (+/- 0.037) in 15 cm s(-1) flow, while M. annularis exhibited no detectable change. Under high-ambient oxygen concentrations, the observed effect of flow on A. agaricites was reversed: photosynthetic efficiencies showed a significant 11% decrease from 0.236 (+/- 0.056) in still water to 0.211 (+/- 0.048) in 15 cm s(-1) flow. These results support the hypothesis that water motion helps to remove oxygen from coral tissues during periods of maximal photosynthesis. Flow mitigation of oxidative stress may at least partially explain the increased incidence and severity of coral bleaching in low flow areas and observations of enhanced recovery in high-flow areas.","Louisiana Univ Marine Consortium, Chauvin, LA 70344 USA; Univ S Carolina, Dept Biol Sci, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; Univ S Carolina, Marine Sci Program, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; Loyola Marymount Univ, Dept Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90045 USA",72,10.1007/s00338-005-0055-8,2006

While it is assumed that pairs represent the breeding unit of these species, the reproductive status of paired versus solitary individuals, and changes in status associated with pair-formation have seldom been investigated. In order to assess whether pairing is related to reproduction we examined whether the ontogenetic timing of pair formation coincided with the onset of maturation in four species of fishes: Chaetodon lunulatus and Chaetodon melannotus (family Chaetodontidae), and Valenciennea muralis and Valenciennea strigata (family Gobiidae). 65-78% of all fishes occurred in pairs. In C. lunulatus and V. muralis, pair-formation coincided with maturation, suggesting that these species form pairs for breeding. Further, C. lunulatus and V. muralis exhibited significant positive size-assortative pairing, which is often associated with monogamous mating. In contrast, pair formation in C. melannotus and V. strigata did not coincide with maturation. In both these species many solitary individuals were reproductive, and same sex pairs were common. While reproduction may be the basis for pairing in some species, both solitary and paired individuals are capable of breeding in others. We propose that non-reproductive mechanisms, such as predator vigilance, may explain pair-formation in coral reef fishes with non-monogamous breeding systems.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Ctr Coral Reef Biodivers, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",19,10.1007/s00338-005-0081-6,2006

Most (89-93%) of the organic carbon and total nitrogen depositing to the carbonate mud zones was mineralized over a sediment depth of 1 m, with similar to 50% of CO2 produced during microbial decomposition involved in carbonate precipitation/dissolution reactions. There was proportionally little burial of organic carbon (10-11%) or nitrogen (7-10%). Nitrogen budgets suggest rapid turnover of porewater inorganic N pools on the order of hours to a few days. Incubation experiments indicate carbonate dissolution in surface deposits (<= 20 cm depth) and carbonate precipitation in deeper sediments. Depth- integrated reaction rates indicate net carbonate precipitation of 7-10 mol CaCO3 m(2) year(-1) over a depth of 1 m. Budget calculations at the whole-reef scale imply that deposition of CaCO3 in the mud zones of both lagoons may equate to 50-90% of total reef carbonate production, with organic carbon fluxes equating to nearly all net primary production on each reef.

Reconstruction of catch estimates with limited hard data requires interpolation and assumptions, justifiable only by the unsatisfactory alternative of continued substitution of zero catches, a common policy interpretation for 'no data'. Uncertainties associated with reconstructions are high, requiring conservative estimation. American Samoan domestic fisheries consist of an artisanal, small-boat sector, whose commercial catches are reported, and a shore-based subsistence sector, with no regular reporting. Our catch reconstruction ( with large pelagic species removed) suggested a 79% decrease in catches between 1950 ( 752 t) and 2002 ( 155 t). Accounting for rapid human population growth on the main island, the per capita catch rate may have declined from 36.3 kg . person(-1) year(-1) in 1950 to 1.3 kg . person(-1) year(-1) by 2002, while the catch rate for the inhabited outer islands has been independently reported as 58.6 kg . person(-1) year(-1). Catch per area of coral reef ( to 50-m depth) may have declined from 5.5 to 0.7 t km(-2) year(-1) for the main island, and from 9.1 to 4.9 t km(-2) year(-1) for the outer islands, for 1950 and 2002, respectively.

A steady-state reduction in phytoplankton abundance and chlorophyll a concentration of 38 +/- 26% ( mean +/- 1 SD) was found for untreated rocks but not for sand, gravel, or killed controls. Average areal clearance rate by untreated rocks was 17.3 +/- 8.0 ml cm(-2) h(-1). Conservative extrapolation of this rate to the whole reef community suggests that the fauna inhabiting exposed rocks clears 2.1 +/- 0.9 m(3) m(-2) d(-1) at Eilat.

This taxon is widely distributed in cryptic coral reef habitats of the Indo-Pacific and is regarded as a modern representative of long-extinct, formerly reef-building stromatoporoid-type sponges. The aims were to clarify phylogeographic and taxonomic relationships in this ""living fossil"" and to explore mitochondrial DNA sequence variation over a wide geographic range. Very low variability was observed across the Indo-Pacific, as only three COI haplotypes were identified, with a maximum p-distance of 0.418% and low nucleotide diversity (pi=0.00049). Very low genetic structure was revealed among populations: Haplotype 1 was found in all specimens from nine Pacific populations (N=45), separated by distances of more than 7,000 km; haplotype 2 was restricted to the Red Sea population (N=4); haplotype 3 was only found in the Tuamoto specimens (N=7). COI data presented here do not support the hypothesis of at least two sibling species belonging to genus Astrosclera in the Pacific. Considering the maximum geographic distance of more than 20,000 km between sampled populations, mtDNA COI sequence variation observed here is among the lowest reported to date for a diploblastic taxon and adds to the growing evidence of a general mtDNA conservation in sponges. It is argued that this low mtDNA variation in A. willeyana s.l. is due to a low rate of mtDNA evolution caused by a combination of long generation time and low metabolic rate.","Univ Gottingen, Geowissensch Zentrum, Abt Geobiol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany",76,10.1007/s00227-005-0134-y,2006

Population differentiation statistics (Phi-values) were estimated using a hierarchical analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) with samples sorted into two groups: open-coast and ria populations. Despite a high potential to disperse, AMOVA demonstrated a modest, statistically significant genetic heterogeneity among N. reticulatus populations. Most of the genetic structure resided in differences among open-coast populations; ria populations were genetically homogeneous. No obvious geographical pattern was detected for the pairwise genetic distances (non-metric multidimensional scaling; UPGMA tree; Mantel test). Unlike previous studies with other species at a variety of estuarine systems other than rias, there was no evidence that the ria of Muros may enhance the genetic divergence of N. reticulatus populations. This discrepancy is discussed in relation to the biological features of the species (high dispersal potential and a preference for mid-low estuarine habitat) and the strong hydrographic connectivity between ria and neighbouring off-shore waters.","Univ A Coruna, Fac Ciencias, Area Ecol, La Coruna 15071, Spain",7,10.1007/s00227-005-0139-6,2006

Faeces released in the water column sink rapidly to the substratum and are consumed by herbivorous and omnivorous fish. Faeces released into night-shelters are rapidly consumed by invertebrate detritivores, and particularly mobile scavengers, such as shrimps and hermit crabs.

They have some resemblance to the juvenile L. dimidiatus and have previously been reported as aggressive cleaner wrasse mimics. We observed 14 P. rhinorhynchus on a small area in the barrier reef near Hoga Island, Indonesia to assess the effects of client size on the behaviour and attack success of fangblennies: our results suggest that fangblennies are selective with regard to victim size; fish avoided by the fangblennies are significantly larger than those not avoided and attack success is significantly higher at intermediate victim size classes. The behaviour of the victims also has a significant direct effect on the foraging success of the fangblennies; where the potential victim posed, 63.6% were ignored by the fangblenny and only 7.4% of attacks were successful on posing fish as opposed to a surprise attack success rate of 71.6%. Overall, victims which exhibited the pose behaviour were significantly smaller in size. It appears likely that the predatory strategy of these fangblennies varies with victim size and that mimicry plays a minor role in attracting potential victims. We suggest that in common with other mimetic fish the resemblance of fangblennies to juvenile bluestreak cleaner wrasse allows them to actively hunt in areas where adult cleaners are common thus, indirectly improving their feeding opportunities.","Univ Hull, Scarborough Ctr Coastal Studies, Scarborough YO11 3AZ, England; Operat Wallacea, Nr Spilsby PE23 4EX, Linconshire, England",8,10.1007/s00227-005-0118-y,2006

Transplanting experiments were carried out to examine the morphological responses of the association to an environmental depth gradient. Simultaneously, we conducted caging experiments to examine the effects of predation (mainly by angelfishes) on association morphology. For this, we transplanted specimens of the association from a control area at 3 m depth to depths of 1 and 5 m, and measured the morphological responses in the association (macro- and microstructure) from the three sites before and after 103 days. The association had the capacity to adjust both macro and micromorphologically, and both external morphology and body structure changed significantly with depth. The specimens grown at 1 m developed a larger surface area of attachment, higher organic density and higher inorganic content than the control specimens at 3 m, and the organisms grown at 5 m depth. We also detected significant differences in the aquiferous system of the sponge, which developed smaller and more numerous oscula at 1 m than at 5 m depth. These differences seem to be consistent with the wave movement as one of the main regulatory factors of the morphology of the association. However, the spicules from H. caerulea were most slender in shallow water, which is not consistent with increasing robustness in the face of greater wave force. The algal skeleton supplied up to 27% of the total inorganic structure of the association; thus, algal contribution significantly reduces the energy costs of spicule production, specifically under high wave exposure, when H. caerulea requires structural reinforcement relative to organic content. The contribution of the sponge to the association (as ratio Si to CaCO3) increased significantly from 3 to 5 m (12% in the uncaged specimens and 22% in the caged specimens), showing that the mutualistic relationship decreases with depth. The production of sponge branches in caged individuals was the most notable difference from uncaged morphs, which could suggest the effect of predators like angelfishes. However, branches could also be a response to the reduction in water movement and irradiance inside the cages. Sponges are known to show morphological acclimation in response to habitat variation, but this is the first study to show it in a sponge living in association with a macroalga.","Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Lab Ecol Bentos, Mazatlan 82000, Mexico; Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Unidad Acad Puerto Morelos, Lab Fotobiol, Cancun 77500, Mexico; Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Postgrado Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Mazatlan, Mexico",27,10.1007/s00227-005-0104-4,2006

Larvae of 5-14 mm SL were released in the sea, and their swimming speed, depth and direction were observed by divers. Behaviour differed among species, and to some extent, among locations. Swimming speed increased linearly at 0.4-2.0 cm s(-1) per mm size, depending on species. The sciaenid was slower than the sparids by 2-6 cm s(-1) at any size, but uniquely, it swam faster in a sheltered bay than in the ocean. Mean speeds were 4-10 body lengths s(-1). At settlement size, mean speed was 5-10 cm s(-1), and the best performing individuals swam up to twice the mean speed. In situ swimming speed was linearly correlated (R-2=0.72) with a laboratory measure of swimming speed (critical speed): the slope of the relationship was 0.32, but due to a non-zero intercept, overall, in situ speed was 25% of critical speed. Ontogenetic vertical migrations of several metres were found in all three species: the sciaenid and one sparid descended, whereas the other sparid ascended to the surface. Overall, 74-84% of individual larvae swam in a non-random way, and the frequency of directional individuals did not change ontogenetically. Indications of ontogenetic change in orientated swimming (i.e. the direction of non-random swimming) were found in all three species, with orientated swimming having developed in the sparids by about 8 mm. One sparid swam W (towards shore) when < 10 mm, and changed direction towards NE (parallel to shore) when > 10 mm.

We tested whether this mechanism was also responsible for the maintenance of aggressive mimicry in natural populations of coral reef fishes. The attack success of bluestriped fangblennies (Plagiotremus rhinorhynchos), which mimic juvenile bluestreaked cleaner wrasses (Labroides dimidiatus) in colour but tear flesh and scales from fishes instead of removing ectoparasites, was frequency-dependent, increasing as mimics became rarer relative to their model. However, cleaner mimics were also more successful on reefs with higher densities of potential victims, perhaps because a dilution-like effect creates few opportunities for potential victims to learn to avoid mimics. Further studies should reveal whether this second mechanism is specific to aggressive mimicry.","Univ E Anglia, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Conservat, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",20,10.1098/rspb.2005.3256,2005

Severe bleaching may result in the loss of live coral and in a decline of the integrity of the impacted coral reef ecosystem. Despite the extensive scientific research and increased public awareness of coral bleaching, uncertainties remain about the past and future of large-scale coral bleaching. In order to reduce these uncertainties and place large-scale coral bleaching in the longer-term climatological context, specific criteria and methods for using historical sea surface temperature (SST) data to examine coral bleaching-related thermal conditions are proposed by analyzing three, 132 year SST reconstructions: ERSST, HadISST1, and GISST2.3b. These methodologies are applied to case studies at Discovery Bay, Jamaica (77.27 degrees W, 18.45 degrees N), Sombrero Reef, Florida, USA (81.11 degrees W, 24.63 degrees N), Academy Bay, Galapagos, Ecuador (90.31 degrees W, 0.74 degrees S), Pearl and Hermes Reef, Northwest Hawaiian Islands, USA (175.83 degrees W, 28.25 degrees N), Davies Reef, Australia (147.68 degrees E, 18.83 degrees S), and North Male Atoll, Maldives (73.35 degrees E, 4.70 degrees N).

However, on coastal coral reefs damselfish occupy habitats that are often dominated by unpalatable macroalgae. The aim of this study was to examine whether damselfish can maintain distinctive algal assemblages on a coastal reef that is seasonally dominated by Sargassum (Magnetic Island, Great Barrier Reef). Here, three abundant species (Pomacentrus tripunctatus, P. wardi and Stegastes apicalis) occupied up to 60% of the reef substrata. All three species promoted the abundance of food algae in their territories. The magnitudes of the effects varied among reef zones, but patterns were relatively stable over time. Damselfish appear to readily co-exist with large unpalatable macroalgae as they can use it as a substratum for promoting the growth of palatable epiphytes. Damselfish territories represent patches of increased epiphyte load on macroalgae, decreased sediment cover, and enhanced cover of palatable algal turf.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Ctr Coral Reef Biodivers, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia",41,10.1007/s00338-005-0035-z,2005

The otoliths of fish collected within Papeete Harbour in Tahiti had distinctive elemental signatures characterised by relatively high concentrations of Mn.

The stochastic population growth rate varied among populations (lambda(s): 0.54-1.03) but was not related to depth. The most important stages for population growth were reproductive adults (shallow) and non-reproductive adults (deep). With the occurrence of storms, vegetative growth (mainly deep) and fertility (mainly shallow) became the most important processes.

The cover of Lobophora increased throughout the study and herbivores did not appear to limit its cover within a 4 year time frame. In contrast, the cover of D. pulchella fluctuated greatly and showed no net increase, despite an increase in parrotfish biomass and settlement space. Variation in the overall percent cover of an alga is not indicative of the underlying patch dynamics. The steady rise in the cover of Lobophora took place despite a high turnover of patches (12-60% of patches per year). The patch dynamics of Dictyota were slower (7-20%), but a greater patch density and threefold higher lateral growth rate led to greater fluctuations in total cover. The dynamics of algal patches are size-specific such that larger patches are less likely to become extinct during hurricanes.","Univ Exeter, Sch Biosci, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England; Nova SE Univ, Oceanog Ctr, Dania, FL 33004 USA",57,10.1007/s00338-005-0058-5,2005

Essentially, outbreaks of A. planci could arise from either (1) a single mass recruitment event or (2) the progressive accumulation of starfish from multiple cohorts. This study explored fine-scale variation in the size, distribution, and abundance of A. planci, during an outbreak at Lizard Island in the northern Great Barrier Reef, to assess the mechanism by which the outbreak occurred. Densities of A. planci around Lizard Island increased very gradually from October 1994 until December 1996, then remained at around 1.0 starfish per 200 m(2) until June 1998. The population of A. planci comprised individuals ranging in size from 11-cm to 62-cm diameter, representing individuals from multiple (at least four) different cohorts. These data suggest that the outbreak of A. planci at Lizard Island resulted from a prolonged build-up in starfish numbers through multiple successive recruitment events. This study shows that outbreaks of A. planci may arise independently of any sudden or substantial increase in rates of recruitment, such that any factor(s) responsible for the initial onset of outbreaks are likely to be very subtle and difficult to detect.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Ctr Coral Reef Biodivers, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",64,10.1007/s00338-005-0006-4,2005

Meiofauna and especially harpacticoid copepods are abundant in seagrass beds and are therefore useful to study ecosystem recovery after disturbance. In the western Caribbean coast, a fragmented Thalassia testudinum seagrass bed was selected to conduct a colonization field experiment by means of plastic seagrass mimics. Meiofauna colonization, with special emphasis on harpacticoid copepods, was followed in relation to: (1) colonization time (2, 4, 6, 10, 14 and 21 days); (2) distance to source of colonizers (close and far series) and (3) leaf surface area to colonize (small, medium, large). Colonization was recorded after 2 days with average meiofauna densities of 480 ind/100 cm(2)supercript stop (close) and 1350 ind/100 cm(2) (far) of leaf surface area, while on average 400 ind/100 cm(2) were collected from the natural seagrass plants. In this early phase, the meiofauna diversity was high, with on average 8 taxa. A longer period of colonization (21 days) showed an increased meiofaunal density and diversity (average density: 3220 ind/100 cm(2) 13 taxa). Increasing meiofauna colonization with time is probably related to the development of a biofilm making the leaf more attractive for meiofauna. The effect of distance was not so pronounced as that of time. Total absolute densities were highest in the far series (5 m away from natural seagrass patch), mainly because of nematode densities. Meiofauna diversity was lower in the far series than in the close series (at the border of the natural seagrass patch). A larger individual leaf surface area did not affect the overall meiofauna densities but had a significant positive effect on copepod densities. Larger surface areas promoted the presence of epiphytic copepod families such as Tegastidae and Dactylopusiidae. Overall, we found a rapid recovery of meiofauna in fragmented seagrass beds with primary colonizers (both nematodes and benthic opportunistic copepods) originating from the sediment and later colonizers as epiphytic copepods and their nauplii from the local seagrass regeneration pool.","State Univ Ghent, Marine Biol Sect, Biol Dept, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; ECOSUR, Chetumal, Mexico",27,10.1007/s00227-005-0062-x,2005

In contrast, C. chromis showed no significant relationships between early-life traits and the magnitude of settlement, and a weak relationship between settlement magnitude and environmental variables.

Both species constitute an economic resource locally called ""bichique"". The focus of this study, S. lagocephalus, accounts for the majority of the bichique. The results clearly showed a genetic homogeneity among the eight samples (Fst tests). Within-samples tests (Fis) indicated, in general, a heterozygote deficiency. The multidimensional diagrams (CA) describe an overall structure composed of two main subgroups. This structure was not confirmed in a 2001 sampling. The interpretation of the results takes into account the biological life cycle of this species, characterized by a planktonic phase, from hatching to recruitment, followed by a freshwater life of the adults. All the samples in the survey belong to a single pool. However, the young fish entering the rivers are probably of complex origin. We did not find any isolation between rivers and this result should be considered when conservation measures are taken to prevent overfishing.","Univ Montpellier 2, UMR 5119, Lab Ecosyst Lagunaires, F-34095 Montpellier, France; Ctr Eaux Douces, Assoc Reunionnaise Dev Aquaculture, F-97427 La Reunion, France; Univ Reunion, Lab Ecol Marine, F-97715 St Denis, France",32,10.1007/s00227-005-0058-6,2005

Sexual dimorphism in the anatomy of the oral jaws and buccal cavity of seven species of paternal mouthbrooding apogonids was therefore investigated. A novel silicon injecting technique was used to quantify between sexes differences in size and shape of the buccal cavity. Osteological and morphological measurements were also examined to identify the structural features associated with variation in buccal volumes. Males buccal volumes were proportionally larger by 20-42% in five of the seven species (P < 0.01), a change that was largely a result of an increase in the depth of buccal cavity. Absence of distinct osteological differences between sexes suggests that changes in the soft anatomy are primarily responsible for the increased buccal volume in males. The average increase of 31% in buccal volume of males appears to reflect their role in mouthbrooding. This is the first study to demonstrate sexual dimorphism of the buccal cavity of multiple mouthbrooding species.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Dept Marine Biol, Ctr Coral Reef Biodivers, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",16,10.1007/s00227-005-0052-z,2005

There is increasing evidence of active attraction to the reef but the sensory abilities of reef fish larvae have not been characterized well enough to fully identify cues. The electrophysiological methods of auditory brainstem response (ABR) and electroolfactogram (EOG) were used to investigate auditory and olfactory abilities of pre- and post-settlement stages of a damselfish, Pomacentrus nagasakiensis (Pisces, Pomacentridae). Audiograms of the two ontogenetic stages were similar. Pre-settlement larvae heard as well as their post-settlement counterparts at all but two of the tested frequencies between 100 Hz and 2,000 Hz. At 100 and 600 Hz, pre- settlement larvae had ABR thresholds 8 dB higher than those of post-settlement juveniles. Both stages were able to detect locally recorded reef sounds. Similarly, no difference in olfactory ability was found between the two ontogenetic stages. Both stages showed olfactory responses to conspecifics as well as L-alanine. Therefore, the auditory and olfactory senses have similar capabilities in both ontogenetic stages.

Consistently, negative relationships between latitude, and positive relationships between sea surface temperature (SST), and relative richness and relative abundance of herbivorous fishes were found worldwide. Significant differences in the strength of gradients of richness and abundance with latitude and SST between tropical and extratropical zones were found consistently across ocean basins. Standardized sampling along the western Atlantic also showed negative relationships between latitude and total density and biomass. The trends, however, are driven by different components of the fish assemblages (i.e., scarids in the Caribbean and acanthurids in Brazil). Patterns of abundance along thermal gradients, generally associated with extensive latitudinal gradients, also were found at the local scale. Feeding rate of the ocean surgeonfish Acanthurus bahianus decreases with temperature more rapidly than the mean metabolic rate of teleost fishes. This relationship suggests a temperature-related physiological constraint. From the new standardized and comparative data presented and the review of the explanatory hypotheses, we conclude that temperature-related feeding and digestive processes are most likely involved in the distribution patterns of herbivorous fishes.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; IEAPM, Dept Oceanog, BR-28930000 Arraial Do Cabo, RJ, Brazil; Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Biol & Fisheries, Miami, FL 33149 USA; Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Biol Sci, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA",119,10.1007/s00227-005-0027-0,2005

It is thus unclear whether these findings extrapolate to larger scales relevant to conservation and management. We show that the results of experiments detecting density-dependent mortality of reef fish on small habitat patches scale up to have similar effects on much larger entire reefs that are the size of small marine reserves and approach the scale at which some reef fisheries operate. We suggest that accurate scaling is due to the type of species interaction causing local density dependence and the fact that localized events can be aggregated to describe larger-scale interactions with minimal distortion. Careful extrapolation from small-scale experiments identifying species interactions and their effects should improve our ability to predict the outcomes of alternative management strategies for coral reef fishes and their habitats.,"Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA",36,10.1073/pnas.0504306102,2005

To gain insight into the structural basis for cyan emission, the crystal structure of amFP486 (lambda(em)(max) = 486 nm) was determined by molecular replacement, and the model was refined at 1.65-angstrom resolution. The electron density map reveals a chromophore formed from the tripeptide sequence -K-Y-G- that is indistinguishable from that of GFP (lambda(em)(max) = ern 509 nm). However, the chromophore environment closely parallels those of the yellow-and red-shifted homologs zFP538, DsRed, and eqFP611. Mutagenesis was performed for Glu-150, Ala-165, His-199, and Glu-217, which are immediately adjacent to the chromophore. His-199 and Ala-165 are key side chains responsible for the blue shift, presumably by localizing chromophore charge density on the phenolate moiety. Furthermore, in the H199T mutant the fluorescence quantum yield is reduced by a factor of approximate to 110. The crystal structures of H199T (lambda(em)(max) = 515 nm) and E150Q (lambda(em)(max) = 506 nm) were deteremined. Remarkably, the H199T structure reveals that the stacking interaction of His-199 with the chromophore also controls the fluorescence efficiency, because the chromophore is statistically distributed in a 1:1 ratio between cis (fluorescent) and trans (nonfluorescent) conformations.","Univ Oregon, Dept Phys, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; Univ Oregon, Dept Chem, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; Univ Oregon, Inst Mol Biol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",74,10.1073/pnas.0502250102,2005

Near settlement swimming abilities may also influence spatial and temporal patterns of recruitment. We examined Critical speed (U-crit) swimming ability in late stage larvae of 89 species of coral reef fishes from the Great Barrier Reef and the Caribbean. Coefficients of variation in U-crit calculated at the individual level were high (28.4%), and this was not explained by differences in size or condition factor of these same larvae. Among species U-crit ranged from 5.5 cm s(-1) to 100.8 cm s(-1) (mean = 37.3 cm s(-1)), with 95% of species able to swim faster than the average current speed around Lizard Island, suggesting that most species should be capable of influencing their spatial and temporal patterns of settlement. Inter-specific differences in swimming ability (at both the family and species levels) were significantly correlated with size and larval morphology. Correlations were found between swimming performance and propulsive area, fineness ratio and aspect ratio, and these morphological parameters may prove useful for predicting swimming ability in other taxa. Overall, the swimming speeds of larvae from the same families at the two locations were relatively similar, although the Lutjanidae and Acanthuridae from the Caribbean were significantly slower than those from the great barrier reef. Differences in swimming speed and body form among late stage larvae suggests that they will respond differently to factors influencing survival and transport during their pelagic phase, as well as habitat use following settlement.","James Cook Univ, Dept Marine Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; Australian Museum, Dept Ichthyol, Darlinghurst, NSW 2010, Australia",102,10.1007/s00227-005-0001-x,2005

Differentiation of agonistic calls into distinct types indicates a complexity not previously recorded in fishes' acoustic communication. Moreover, various acoustic parameters, including peak frequency, pulse duration, number of peaks per pulse, differed between the two populations.

Yet, the role of species interactions for the stability of spatially subdivided communities still eludes ecologists. Ecological models currently address the problem of stability by exploring the role of interaction strength in well mixed habitats, or of connectivity in subdivided communities. Here I propose a unification of interaction strength and connectivity as mechanisms explaining regional community stability. I introduce a metacommunity model based on succession dynamics in coastal ecosystems, incorporating limited dispersal and facilitative interactions. I report a sharp transition in regional stability and extinction probability at intermediate interaction strength, shown to correspond to a phase transition that generates scale-invariant distribution and high regional stability. In contrast with previous studies, stability results from intermediate interaction strength only in subdivided communities, and is associated with large-scale (scale-invariant) synchrony. These results can be generalized to other systems exhibiting phase transitions to show how local interaction strength can be used to resolve the link between regional community stability and pattern formation.","McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada",16,10.1098/rpb.2005.3118,2005

Pink morphs are more abundant in the lagoon and in deeper areas, while green morphs are more abundant in the forereef and in shallower areas. We use DNA sequence data ( ITS15.8S) to investigate if variation in color is associated with genetic differentiation in lagoon and forereef habitats about 5 km apart. Population genetic analyses reveal two distinct ITS1-5.8S variants, which differ in relative frequency. The two variants are present in both habitats, but a dearth of intermediates suggests reduced gene flow. In the lagoon, but not the forereef, ITS variants show an association with color. In order to address the potential ecological significance of color, we study UV absorbance and UV acclimatization capacities of pink and green color morphs in the lagoon. Color morphs differed significantly in UV-B absorbance.

Movement between patches may be an important modifier of patterns established at settlement, yet local immigration and emigration have received less attention than other demographic rates. I examined loss rates from tagged populations of juvenile wrasses (yellowhead wrasse Halichoeres garnoti and bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum) at two sites in the Bahamas. Assuming that all losses were due solely to mortality would have significantly underestimated survivorship of yellowhead wrasse by 29% and bluehead wrasse by 14%. On average, per capita mortality and emigration rates were higher for yellowhead than bluehead wrasse, but neither demographic rate differed between sites for either species. With respect to within-species density, bluehead wrasse mortality was density-dependent at the patch reef site, but mortality rates of yellowhead wrasse were consistently density-independent. Evaluating the effects of between-species density, yellowhead wrasse mortality increased with a decrease in bluehead wrasse density, but this effect was limited to the patch reef site. Emigration rates were not a function of either within-species or between-species density, but instead varied inversely with isolation distance. Numerous previous studies of coral-reef fish, conducted on patch reefs separated by only a few meters of sand and often using untagged fish, may have confounded losses due to emigration with those due to mortality. A better understanding of the factors affecting emigration in marine fishes is important to their effective management using spatial tools such as marine protected areas.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",11,10.1007/s00338-005-0477-3,2005

Larval growth was correlated, using multiple regression techniques, with a combination of factors including solar radiation, rainfall, and along-shore winds. Depending on the life history stage, these accounted for 13-38% of the variation in growth rates when all the months were included in the analyses. Correlations between environmental variables and growth also varied among seasons and were stronger in the dry than in the wet season. During the dry season solar radiation, rainfall and along-shore winds described 57%, 86% and 74% of the variability in growth between 0 and 6 days, 7 and 25 days and 26 and 50 days, respectively. During the wet season rainfall, along-shore winds and temperature only described 38% of the variability in early growth and 27% of growth just before settlement. No significant model was found to describe growth 7-25 days after hatching during the wet season. Rainfall, solar radiation and along-shore winds were negatively correlated with growth up to 25 days after hatching but positively correlated as larvae approached settlement at a mean age of 52 days. Over 65% of the variability in pelagic larval duration was accounted for by a regression model that included solar radiation and along-shore winds. When data sets from wet and dry seasons were analysed separately, along-shore winds accounted for 67% of the change in larval duration in the dry season, and solar radiation accounted for 23% of the variation in larval duration in the wet season. Only 22% of the variability in settlement intensity could be described by solar radiation and temperature, when all months of the year were included in the analysis. Solar radiation and rainfall were included in a regression model that accounted for 40% of the variation in numbers of fish settling during the dry season.

The lagoon of Moorea Island was divided into 12 habitat zones (i.e. coral seascapes), which were distinct in terms of depth, wave exposure, and substratum composition. Eighty-two species of recently settled juveniles were recorded from March to June 2001. Visual censuses documented changes in the distribution of juveniles of each species over time among the 12 habitats. Two patterns of juvenile habitat use were found among species. Firstly, some species settled and remained in the same habitat until the adoption of the adult habitats (i.e. recruitment; e.g. Chaetodon citrinellus, Halichoeres hortulanus, Rhinecanthus aculeatus). Secondly, others settled to several habitats and then disappeared from some habitats through differential mortality and/or post-settlement movement (e.g. 65-70 mm size class for Ctenochaetus striatus, 40-45 mm size class for Epinephelus merra, 50-55 mm size class for Scarus sordidus). A comparison of the spatial distribution of juveniles to that of adults (61 species recorded at both stages) illustrated four patterns of subsequent recruitment in habitat use: (1) an increase in the number of habitats used during the adult stage (e.g. H. hortulanus, Mulloidichthys flavolineatus); (2) a decrease in the number of habitats adults used compared to recently settled juveniles (e.g. Chrysiptera leucopoma, Stethojulis bandanensis); (3) the use of different habitat types (e.g. Acanthurus triostegus, Caranx melampygus); and (4) no change in habitat use (e.g. Naso litturatus, Stegastes nigricans).

Fish use of discarded conch shells was investigated in four different habitat types: sand, seagrass beds, mangrove forests, and coral reefs. The study was carried out in the waters off South Caicos, Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI), between October 2003 and January 2004. The density of discarded shells was greatest near coral reefs; however, the percentage of shells occupied by adult fish was higher in isolated shells on sand and in mangrove habitats. Juvenile fish also showed a preference for sheltering in conch shells relative to other microhabitat types on sandy plains and in mangrove and seagrass habitats. Differences in use of single shells by fish in different habitats were attributed to differences in piscivore abundance and habitat complexity. Although not all isolated shells were occupied by fish, all conch middens deposited by fishermen had fish inhabitants. Examination of fish use of conch middens in three habitat types and conch piles of one, three, and five shells constructed on sand found both fish diversity and abundance increased on conch middens of increasing size. This study suggests that disposal of conch shells as large middens in habitats of low complexity will increase the amount of shelter present and may enhance fish populations in these habitats.","Ctr Marine Resource Studies, Sch Field Studies, Salem, MA 01970 USA",10,10.1007/s00227-005-1556-2,2005

Among-habitat variation in morphology and performance was directly compared with quantitative values of wave-induced water motion from seven coral reef habitats of different depth and wave exposure on the Great Barrier Reef. Fin morphology was strongly correlated with both field and experimental swimming speeds in all three families. The range of observed swimming speeds coincided closely with the magnitude of water velocities commonly found on coral reefs. Distribution patterns in all three families displayed highly congruent relationships between fin morphology and wave-induced water motion. Our findings indicate a general functional relationship between fin morphology and swimming performance in labriform-swimming fishes, and provide quantitative evidence that wave energy may directly influence the assemblage structure of coral reef fishes through interactions with morphology and swimming performance.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Dept Marine Biol, Ctr Coral Reef Biodivers, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; Univ Calif Davis, Sect Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA",96,10.1098/rspb.2004.3029,2005

The feeding behavior of two species of tube-dwelling coral reef fish (Chaenopsidae) was studied in still and turbulent water. One species of blenny, Acanthemblemaria spinosa , lives in holes higher above the reef surface and feeds mainly on calanoid copepods, while a second, A. aspera , lives closer to the reef surface, feeds mainly on harpacticoid copepods, and is exposed to less water motion than the first. In the laboratory, these two blenny species were video recorded attacking a calanoid copepod ( Acartia tonsa, evasive prey) and an anostracan branchiopod (nauplii of Artemia sp., passive prey). Whereas A. spinosa attacked with the same vigor in still and turbulent water, A. aspera modulated its attack with a more deliberate strike under still conditions than turbulent conditions. For both fish species combined, mean capture success when feeding on Artemia sp. was 100% in still water and dropped to 78% in turbulent water. In contrast, when feeding on Acartia tonsa, mean capture success was 21% in still water and rose to 56% in turbulent water. We hypothesize that, although turbulence reduces capture success by adding erratic movement to Artemia sp. (passive prey), it increases capture success of Acartia tonsa (evasive prey) by interfering with the hydrodynamic sensing of the approaching predator. These opposite effects of water motion increase the complexity of the predator-prey relationship as water motion varies spatially and temporally on structurally complex coral reefs. Some observations were consistent with A. aspera living in a lower energy benthic boundary layer as compared with A. spinosa: slower initial approach to prey, attack speeds modulated according to water velocity, and lower proportion of approaches that result in strikes in turbulent water.","Sarah Lawrence Coll, Dept Biol, Bronxville, NY 10708 USA; Univ Texas, Inst Marine Sci, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USA; Yeshiva Univ Albert Einstein Coll Med, Bronx, NY 10461 USA",31,10.1007/s00227-004-1528-y,2005

Physical barriers are few in the ocean and larval dispersal is often extensive, a combination that should reduce opportunities for speciation. Yet coral reefs are among the most species-rich habitats in the world, indicating evolutionary processes beyond conventional allopatry. In a survey of mtDNA sequences of five congeneric west Atlantic reef fishes (wrasses, genus Halichoeres) with similar dispersal potential, we observed phylogeographical patterns that contradict expectations of geographical isolation, and instead indicate a role for ecological speciation. In Halichoeres bivittatus and the species pair Halichoeres radiatus/brasiliensis, we observed strong partitions (3.4% and 2.3% divergence, respectively) between adjacent and ecologically distinct habitats, but high genetic connectivity between similar habitats separated by thousands of kilometres. This habitat partitioning is maintained even at a local scale where H. bivittatus lineages are segregated between cold- and warm-water habitats in both Bermuda and Florida. The concordance of evolutionary partitions with habitat types, rather than conventional biogeographical barriers, indicates parapatric ecological speciation, in which adaptation to alternative environmental conditions in adjacent locations overwhelms the homogenizing effect of dispersal.

To bridge the gap between Porvenir and the Colombia-Panama border, we investigated with Landsat images the extent and geomorphological diversity of the entire Kuna Yala to provide geomorphologic maps of the archipelago in 12 classes. In addition to remote sensing data, in situ survey conducted in May-June 2001 provided a Kuna Yala-wide first synoptic vision of reef status, in terms of benthic diversity (number of species of coral, octocorals, and sponges) and reef health (coral versus algal cover). For a total reef system estimated to cover 638 km(2) along 480 km of coastline, 195 km(2) include coral dominated areas and only 35 km(2) can be considered covered by corals. A total of 69 scleractinian coral, 38 octocoral, and 82 sponge species were recorded on the outer slopes of reef formations, with a slightly higher diversity in the area presenting the most abundant and diverse reef formations (western Kuna Yala). Attempts to relate benthic diversity and geomorphological diversity provided only weak relationships regardless of the taxa, and suggest that habitat heterogeneity within geomorphological areas explain better the patterns of coral diversity.

The goal of this study was to characterize the small-scale distribution of zooplankton above the coral reef of Eilat, Israel. Four vertical arrays, each consisting five underwater pumps attached 0.5-3 m apart on a taut mooring, were deployed for 10 days at two sites over the reef slope. A distinct layer of depleted zooplankton was repeatedly found in the 1.5 m high benthic boundary layer. The gradient was sharpest for strong swimmers (copepods and polychaeta), intermediate for weak swimmers (nauplii, mollusks and appendicularia), and lacking for passive taxa (eggs and foraminifera). Spatio-temporal changes in the abundance of copepods and polychaetes were highly correlated, more so in the water aloft (Pearson r > 0.9) than near the bottom (r > 0.8). The spatio-temporal correlations between weak swimmers and between passive taxa were much weaker (r < 0.8 and r < 0.4, respectively). Flow and shear stress did not affect the distribution patterns.

Size-spectra, relationships between abundance and body-size class, regardless of taxonomy, can be calculated from simple sizeabundance data. Both the slope and the mid-point height of the relationship can be compared at different fishing intensities. Here, we develop size-spectra for reef fish assemblages using body size-abundance data collected by underwater visual census in each of ten fishing grounds across a known gradient of fishing intensity in the Kadavu Island group, Fiji. Slopes of the size-spectra became steeper (F-9,F-69=3.20, p < 0.01) and the height declined (F-9,F-69=15.78, p < 0.001) with increasing fishing intensity. Regressions of numbers of individuals per size class across grounds were negative for all size classes, although the slope was almost zero for the smallest size class. Response to exploitation of each size class category was greatest for larger fish. Steepening of the slope with increasing fishing intensity largely resulted from reductions in the relative abundance of large fish and not from the ecological release of small fish following depletion of their predators. The slope and height of the size-spectrum appear to be good indicators of fishing effects on reef fish assemblages.","Univ Newcastle, Sch Marine Sci & Technol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Lowestoft Lab, Ctr Environm, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England",92,10.1007/s00338-004-0466-y,2005

Histological examination of the gonads and gonad index measurements for 3 years showed a seasonal reproductive cycle with gametogenesis commencing in July, when temperature and light are at their lowest, and spawning commencing in December and peaking in February to May, when temperature and light reach their annual maxima. Monthly gonad indices correlated significantly with seawater temperature and light intensity. Male urchins had mature gametes for a longer period (8 months) than females (6 months), possibly an adaptive strategy that increases the probability of fertilization. Lunar periodicity was not observed, as male and female gonads were full of gametes on all days of the lunar cycle during the period of spawning. The peak in spawning activity coincides with the peak in phytoplankton abundance, which could ensure high food availability for the planktonic larvae. Gonad weights were significantly higher relative to urchin weight at the reef having the largest mean sizes and lowest population of urchins, indicating availability of food resources for growth and reproduction. E. mathaei at the reef with the highest density had the smallest urchins and high relative gonad sizes, indicative of a tradeoff between growth and reproduction when food is limited.","Wildlife Conservat Soc, Marine Program, Bronx, NY 10460 USA; Mwangaza Ctr, Langata 00509, Kenya",28,10.1007/s00227-004-1449-9,2005

We tested critical predictions of Batesian mimicry models, i.e. that benefits of mimicry to mimics and costs of mimicry to models should be experienced only when model and mimic co-occur, in an aggressive mimicry system involving juvenile bluestreaked cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus) as models and bluestriped fangblennies (Plagiotremus rhinorhynchos) as mimics. Cleanerfish mimics encountered nearly twice as many potential victims and had higher striking rates when in proximity to than when away from the model. Conversely, in the presence of mimics, juvenile cleaner wrasses were visited by fewer clients and spent significantly less time foraging. The benefits to mimic and costs to model thus depend on a close spatial association between model and mimic. Batesian mimicry theory may therefore provide a useful initial framework to understand aggressive mimicry.","Univ E Anglia, Sch Biol Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",24,10.1098/rspb.2004.2904,2004

Within labrid fishes they are very rare, however, we have found them in labrid cleaner fish that feed on the ectoparasites of fish. We surveyed 969 labrid fishes from the tropical Pacific and found bucephalids only in cleaners (Lahroides dimidiatus, L. bicolor, and Bodianus axillaris) and none in piscivores. The prevalences of bucephalids in L. dimidiatus at Lizard Island, Heron Island, Orpheus Island (all on the Great Barrier Reef), New Caledonia, and Moorea (French Polynesia) were 51, 47, 67, 56, and 67%, respectively. All of the L. bicolor examined from Moorea were infected. Bucephalids were highly prevalent in all size classes of L. dimidiatus from Lizard Island. Bucephalids were found in a 1.6-cm long juvenile L. dimidiatus, in which, piscivory is highly unlikely. We examined the literature on the worldwide bucephalid fauna in labrids and all hosts were found to be cleaners (Symphodus tinca, S. mediterraneus, L. dimidiatus, L. bicolor, and Bodianus axillaris) except Notolabrus parilus, whose ecology is unknown. We suggest that cleaners eat bucephalid metacercariae directly from the exterior surface of client fish during cleaning interactions. This is the first evidence of digeneans in the diet of L. dimidiatus, and the first study to show this novel form of parasite transmission where infective stages are eaten as a result of cleaning behaviour. Cleaning-mediated parasite transmission may result in behavioural modification of second intermediate hosts because clients and parasites both benefit from transmission. If the infection is costly to cleaners and acquired during cheating behaviour, then this parasite might regulate mutualism. Alternatively, if infective stages are targeted, infection by these bucephalids may be a negative consequence of an honest foraging strategy.","Univ Queensland, Sch Life Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4074, Australia; Univ Queensland, Dept Microbiol & Parasitol, Brisbane, Qld 4074, Australia; Univ Queensland, Ctr Marine Studies, Brisbane, Qld 4074, Australia",8,10.1007/s00338-004-0411-0,2004

This study evaluates the use of passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags to quantify small-scale space use in a marine damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis (Pomacentridae). Implanting small PIT tags in the body cavity of fish down to 5.2 g with a hypodermic needle had no adverse effect on mortality or growth over a 47-day tank study. A 63-day field study also showed that tags had no influence on body condition as measured by Fulton's condition factor (K), gonadosomatic indices, or plasma cortisol levels (a physiological indicator of stress). The utility of PIT-tag technology is illustrated by preliminary information from a study on the diel periodicity of visitations to male nest sites by female P. amboinensis. Information suggests that there is a strong periodicity in visitations. Females first entered the nest site at 03:20 h, with 88% of the total of 4 h 45 min that females spent within a single nest occurring prior to dawn. Despite this, 81% of the total visitations to the nest occurred after dawn, with most being very brief, averaging 17 s. No one female monopolized access to the nest, with nine females accounting for 90% of the time that females spent within the nest site.

We studied the grazing dynamics on the Caribbean reef-building coral Montastraea annularis. We transplanted colonies to algae-dominated reefs (Rosario Islands, Cartagena, Colombia), where they encountered higher grazing pressure. We counted grazed polyps every month throughout a year. Over the course of a year, 4,101 different grazed polyps were counted on lobe-like M. annularis transplants (n = 23). Grazing was evaluated on a monthly basis as the probabilities of all the possible transitions among four grazing categories (0%, > 0-1 %, > 1-5%, > 5% grazed tissue), uncovering a dynamic process. Higher transition probabilities were always between 0 and 1% (coral tissue grazed) grazing states, indicating that grazing did not usually exceed 1% per coral per month. The probability of remaining uninjured in a month was 0.19, 0.17 of a change from 0-1 % grazing state, 0.31 of remaining at 1%, and of full recovery from 1% grazing was 0.16. More than one month was usually required for complete recovery (P < 1) probably due to both steady grazing pressure and slow regeneration rates. Since the marking behaviour of the parrotfish was not as common on other zones of the reef no comparison on the grazing among environments was possible. In spite of this, it is possible to have stable transplanted populations of corals such as M. annularis on algae-dominated Caribbean reef environments due to their tolerance to the natural grazing pressure.","Univ Bogota Jorge Tadeo Lozano, Ctr Invest Cientificas, Museo Mar, Bogota, Colombia",26,10.1007/s00338-004-0419-5,2004

Several particular Symbiodinium sub-genera or clades inhabit these soritids. One of these groups, referred to as clade C, dominates corals and their relatives throughout the tropical Indo-Pacific. In contrast, the distributions of Symbiodinium spp. from clades A, B, and C are more evenly apportioned across Caribbean invertebrate communities. To explore the possibility that a similar biogeographic break exists in the symbionts harbored by soritids, we surveyed the Symbiodinium spp. from the soritid genus Sorites, collected from the Pacific and Caribbean coasts of Panama as well as from Florida. Characterization of Symbiodinium obtained from foraminiferal and cnidarian samples was conducted using restriction fragment length polymorphism and phylogenetic analyses of the nuclear internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS 2) and a portion of the large subunit ribosomal DNA sequences. A distinctive biogeographic break between the kinds of symbionts found in Sorites from the East Pacific and Caribbean was clearly evident. Differences between cnidarian and foraminferan symbioses in each ocean may be explained by the subjection of Caribbean communities to severer environmental conditions during the early Quarternary. Caribbean Sorites spp. harbored symbionts described from clade F (specifically sub-clade Fr4) and clade H ( formally referred to as Fr1), while Sorites spp. from the eastern Pacific were dominated by a single Symbiodinium haplotype in clade C. An ITS 2 phylogeny determined that most clade C ""types'' recovered from Indo-Pacific soritids form a monophyletic sub-lineage with other clade C symbionts typically found in Pacific corals from the genus Porites. The existence of multiple Symbiodinium lineages at various taxonomic levels associated specifically with soritids indicates that symbioses with these hosts are important in driving Symbiodinium spp. evolution.","Univ Geneva, Dept Zool & Anim Biol, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland; Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA",83,10.1007/s00227-004-1427-2,2004

However, these studies are not sufficient to fully understand the expansion dynamics of the exotics. The present framework is devoted to comparing life-history traits between the introduced and resident species. Our results first showed that O. inornatus has more favourable traits, such as a better mean growth rate and a higher reproductive effort, in comparison with O. erinacea. These traits may explain the invader establishment and, partly, its spread along the coast of France. Secondly, the resident species drilled a higher rate of oysters than the invader. Finally, the establishment of O. inornatus in France does not seem to be at the expense of O. erinacea because: (1) resources are not limiting in oyster farming areas and (2) there does not appear to be competition by interference between the species.","Univ La Rochelle, CNRS, FRE 2727, Lab Biol & Environm Marins, F-17042 La Rochelle, France; IFREMER, CNRS, UMR 10, Ctr Rech Ecosyst Marins & Aquacoles, F-17137 LHoumeau, France; Ronce Les Bains, Lab Conchyliole Poitou Charentes, F-17390 La Tremblade, France",7,10.1007/s00227-004-1421-8,2004

The study was conducted in Moorea, French Polynesia (17degrees32'S; 149degrees50'W), from 31 December 1994 to 11 March 1995. For gonadal histology, two populations were sampled, one consisting of large aggregations (n = 54) and the other consisting of small- to medium-sized groups around isolated corals (n = 55). An additional small sample (n = 21) was also collected from a population that consisted of small groups around isolated corals. After an initially undifferentiated state, gonads of D. flavicaudus developed an ovarian lumen, followed by oocytes in the primary growth stage. From this ovarian state or from more developed ovaries with cortical-alveolus stage oocytes, some gonads developed into testes through degeneration of oocytes and development of spermatogenic tissue. In all three populations, spermatogenic tissue developed only in gonads that contained pre-vitellogenic oocytes ( termed as mixed stage 1 - 2 gonads). The two main populations did not differ in their expression of sex change despite differences in their social organization. In both populations, size of individuals with mixed stage 1 - 2 gonads overlapped mainly with the size range of immature females, which suggests that functional female-to-male sex change was rare. The hypothesis that D. flavicaudus is primarily gonochoristic is further supported by removal experiments in laboratory groups, in which removal of a dominant male(s) failed to induce sex change in any of the high-ranking females. Yet, in all three field populations, some fish with mixed stage 1 - 2 gonads were found within the size ranges of mature females, which indicates possible occurrences of functional sex change. These conflicting results indicate that it may be premature to draw any definitive conclusions about the sexual pattern of D. flavicaudus.","Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; Ochanomizu Univ, Dept Biol, Tokyo 112, Japan; Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Zool, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",10,10.1007/s00227-004-1414-7,2004

Here we tested the hypothesis that the presence of a potential mating partner induces maturation and sex determination in a coral-dwelling fish, Gobiodon erythrospilus. In natural populations at Lizard Island (Great Barrier Reef), single individuals were less likely to be mature than paired individuals and they matured at a larger size, indicating plasticity in the timing of maturation. By manipulating group structure we demonstrated that both the timing of maturation and the sex of maturing individuals are socially controlled. Single juveniles did not mature, but maturation was rapidly induced by the presence of an adult partner. In addition, sex determination was found to be labile, with juveniles maturing into the opposite sex of the partner encountered. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental demonstration of social induction of maturation in conjunction with labile sex determination at maturation in vertebrates. This flexibility enables individuals to maximize their reproductive success in an environment where the timing of mate acquisition and the sex of their future partner are unpredictable.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Ctr Coral Reef Biodivers, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",36,10.1098/rspb.2004.2845,2004

In addition to competitive abilities in direct interactions with a contestant, external influences such as disturbance caused by nutrient input may determine the outcome of antagonistic interactions. We examined the competitive success of corallimorpharians on coral reefs by investigating their distribution patterns within reefs and how well they perform in interference competition with staghorn corals in different environments. Substrate composition and corallimorpharian growth were examined on three reefs in Tanzania under different disturbance regimes using the line-intercept transect and point techniques. A transplant experiment was conducted in which staghorn corals (Acropora formosa) were exposed to the polyps of Rhodactis rhodostoma to establish how competition between corals and corallimorpharians affects their respective distributions. Within reefs corallimorpharians seemed to be more competitive in shallow waters. This could be due to both environmental factors as well as varied competitive abilities depending on surrounding benthos that changed with depth. Reef environment also seemed to influence corallimorpharian growth among reefs as they had the highest densities in the areas with the highest nutrient loads. The transplant experiment revealed that the corallimorpharians had a competitive advantage over the corals, and in comparisons of reefs influenced by different degrees of disturbance, corallimorpharians were most competitive in the area with the highest nutrient content. Hence, stress on coral reefs in the form of raised nutrient loads may favour the competitive success of corallimorpharians.","Univ Stockholm, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; Univ Dar Es Salaam, Fac Aquat Sci & Technol, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania",20,10.1007/s00227-004-1376-9,2004

The foraging grounds range from coral reef habitats at the north-western end of the archipelago, to coastal habitats around the main islands at the southeastern end of the archipelago. Pelagic juveniles recruit to these neritic foraging grounds from ca. 35 cm SCL or 5 kg ( similar to 6 years of age), but grow at foraging-ground-specific rates, which results in quite different size- and age-specific growth rate functions. Growth rates were estimated for the five populations as change in straight carapace length ( cm SCL year) 1) and, for two of the populations, also as change in body mass ( kg year) 1). Expected growth rates varied from ca. 0 - 2.5 cm SCL year) 1, depending on the foraging-ground population, which is indicative of slow growth and decades to sexual maturity, since expected size of first-time nesters is greater than or equal to 80 cm SCL. The expected size- specific growth rate functions for four populations sampled in the southeastern archipelago displayed a non-monotonic function, with an immature growth spurt at ca. 50 - 53 cm SCL ( similar to 18 - 23 kg) or ca. 13 - 19 years of age. The growth spurt for the Midway atoll population in the northwestern archipelago occurs at a much larger size ( ca. 65 cm SCL or 36 kg), because of slower immature growth rates that might be due to a limited food stock and cooler sea surface temperature. Expected age-at-maturity was estimated to be ca. 35 - 40 years for the four populations sampled at the south-eastern end of the archipelago, but it might well be > 50 years for the Midway population. The Hawaiian stock comprises mainly the same mtDNA haplotype, with no differences in mtDNA stock composition between foraging-ground populations, so that the geographic variability in somatic growth rates within the archipelago is more likely due to local environmental factors rather than genetic factors. Significant temporal variability was also evident, with expected growth rates declining over the last 10 - 20 years, while green turtle abundance within the archipelago has increased significantly since the mid-1970s. This inverse relationship between somatic growth rates and population abundance suggests a density-dependent effect on somatic growth dynamics that has also been reported recently for a Caribbean green turtle stock. The Hawaiian green turtle stock is characterised by slow growth rates displaying significant spatial and temporal variation and an immature growth spurt. This is consistent with similar findings for a Great Barrier Reef green turtle stock that also comprises many foraging-ground populations spanning a wide geographic range.","Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",77,10.1007/s00227-004-1387-6,2004

A survey of the distribution, biomass, and productivity of benthic microalgae on a platform reef flat and in a cross-shelf transect in the southern Great Barrier Reef indicated that benthic microalgae are ubiquitous, abundant (up to 995.0 mg chlorophyll (chl) a m(-2)), and productive (up to 110 mg O-2 m(-2) h(-1)) components of the reef ecosystem. Concentrations of benthic microalgae, expressed as chlorophyll a per surface area, were approximately 100-fold greater than the integrated water column concentrations of microalgae throughout the region. Benthic microalgal biomass was greater on the shallow water platform reef than in the deeper waters of the cross-shelf transect. In both areas the benthic microalgal communities had a similar composition, dominated by pennate diatoms, dinoflagellates, and cyanobacteria. Benthic microalgal populations were potentially nutrient-limited, based on responses to nitrogen and phosphorus enrichments in short-term (7-day) microcosm experiments. Benthic microalgal productivity, measured by O-2 evolution, indicated productive communities responsive to light and nutrient availability. The benthic microalgal concentrations observed (92-995 mg chl a m(-2)) were high relative to other reports, particularly compared with temperate regions. This abundance of productive plants in both reef and shelf sediments in the southern Great Barrier Reef suggests that benthic microalgae are key components of coral reef ecosystems.","Univ Queensland, Sch Life Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",28,10.1007/s00338-004-0390-1,2004

Several marine ornamental species, including the Banggai cardinalfish, are biologically unsuitable for large-scale exploitation, yet their trade continues largely unmonitored. With little known about the Banggai cardinalfish or its trade, we interviewed trade participants from north and central Sulawesi, Indonesia to document the organization, scale, and price structure of the species' local collection and sale. Interviews revealed a large and growing commerce in Banggai cardinalfish, with at least 118,000 fish per month being sold in the Banggai region during the study period. Given the scale of the trade, the species' restricted geographic range, and its natural susceptibility to exploitation, we propose that long-term monitoring is needed to safeguard Banggal cardinalfish populations and to serve as a much-needed example for monitoring and managing other marine ornamental fishes at risk of over-exploitation.","Zool Soc London, London NW1 4RY, England",21,10.1007/s00338-004-0393-y,2004

The rapid field sampling technique uses divers to visually estimate the percentage cover of categories of benthos and substratum along 2x20 in plotless strip-transects positioned randomly over the tops, and systematically along the edge of reefs. The purpose of this study was to compare the relative sampling accuracy of the RRI against the line intercept transect technique (LIT), an international standard for sampling reef benthos and substratum. Analysis of paired sampling with LIT and RRI at 51 sites indicated sampling accuracy was not different (P > 0.05) for 8 of the 12 benthos and substratum categories used in the study. Significant differences were attributed to small-scale patchiness and cryptic coloration of some benthos; effects associated with sampling a sparsely distributed animal along a line versus an area; difficulties in discriminating some of the benthos and substratum categories; and differences due to visual acuity since LIT measurements were taken by divers close to the seabed whereas RRI measurements were taken by divers higher in the water column. The relative cost efficiency of the RRI technique was at least three times that of LIT for all benthos and substratum categories and as much as 10 times higher for two categories. These results suggest that the RRI can be used to obtain reliable and accurate estimates of relative abundance of broad categories of reef benthos and substratum.","Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Stat & Appl Probabil, Crescent 119260, Singapore; Oceanog Res Ctr, Jakarta, Indonesia",6,10.1007/s00338-004-0403-0,2004

The reef flat section is 3 km long, with a 3 m tidal range, and on the days measured, subject to 6 in s(-1) tradewinds. The measured nitrate uptake coefficient, S, on two consecutive days during the rising tide was 1.23 +/- 0.28 and 1.42 +/- 0.52x 10(-4) m s(-1).

We found that in cavities the hard substratum surface area (=ca 68% of cavity surface area) is 65% covered with sessile filter feeders. The cryptic cavity surface area exceeds the projected surface area of the reef by 1.5-8 times. Consequently, the organisms living in these cryptic habitats have potentially a large impact on pico- and nano-plankton densities and are important in reef water nutrient dynamics. We closed cavities ( 70 1 volume, 15 m depth) in seven experiments to study changes in bacterial densities and dissolved inorganic nutrients (DIN, DIP, and silicate) over time. Water samples were taken from the middle of the cavity at 5-min intervals, for 30 min, and analyzed for heterotrophic bacterial abundance and nutrient concentrations. After closure, bacterial abundance dropped rapidly. Of the initial bacterial concentration in the cavities, 50-60% had disappeared after 30 min, an average disappearance rate of 1.43x 10(4) bacteria ml(-1) min(-1) (0.62 mg C l(-1) d(-1); or 30.1 mg C m(-2) cavity surface area d(-1)). NOx concentrations increased significantly during the time of closure. Efflux rates varied between 1.02-9.77 mmol m(-2) cavity surface area d(-1). NH4+ and PO43- concentrations were variable and did not show a consistent change over time in the experiments. Comparison of bacterial organic nitrogen disappearance rates and DIN (NOx+NH4+) release rates suggests that on average only 30-40% of additional sources of N besides bacteria were required to balance the nitrogen budget. This highlights the importance of heterotrophic bacterioplankton as food for cryptic filter feeders on coral reefs. Silicate concentrations significantly decreased after closure with 0.50 mmol m(-2) cavity surface area d(-1), suggesting the net deposition Of SiO42- in spicules of cryptic filter feeding sponges. We conclude that coral reef cavities are a major sink for heterotrophic bacteria, a sink for dissolved silicon (DSi), and a source for NOx. That reef cavities are a source for NOx suggests strong remineralization and nitrification in cavities with a potential role for sponge-symbiotic microbial nitrification.","Netherlands Inst Sea Res, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands; Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; CARMABI Fdn, Willemstad, Curacao, Neth Antilles",39,10.1007/s00338-004-0400-3,2004

Coral bleaching has often been attributed to periods of above normal seawater temperatures and/or calm conditions with high levels of ultraviolet radiation. Unusually high shallow-water temperature (>29degreesC) in Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, USA, in late summer (20 August-9 September) and fall (1-7 October) of 1996 produced visible bleaching of two dominant corals, Porites compressa Dana, 1864 and Montipora verrucosa Dana, 1864. The present study examined chlorophyll a (chl a), total lipid concentrations, and lipid class composition in corals of both species in which the entire colony was non-bleached, moderately bleached, or bleached. Skeletal, host tissue, and algal symbiont delta(13)C values were also measured in non-bleached and bleached colonies. In additional unevenly bleached colonies, paired samples were collected from bleached upper surfaces and non-bleached sides. Samples were collected on 20 November 1996 during the coral recovery phase, a time when seawater temperatures had been back to normal for over a month. Chl a levels were significantly lower in bleached colonies of both species compared with non-bleached specimens, and in bleached areas of unevenly bleached single colonies. Total lipid concentrations were significantly lower in bleached P. compressa compared with non-bleached colonies, whereas total lipid concentrations were the same in bleached and non-bleached M. verrucosa colonies. The proportion of triacylglycerols and wax esters was lower in bleached colonies of both species. Both bleached and non-bleached M. verrucosa had from similar to17% to 35% of their lipids in the form of diacylglycerol, while this class was absent in P. compressa. delta(13)C was not significantly different in the host tissue and algal symbiont fractions in non-bleached and bleached samples of either species. This suggests that the ratio of carbon acquired heterotrophically versus photosynthetically was the same regardless of condition. Skeletal delta(13)C was significantly lower in bleached than in non-bleached corals. This is consistent with previous findings that lower rates of photosynthesis during bleaching results in lower skeletal delta(13)C values. The two species in this study displayed different lipid class compositions and total lipid depletions following bleaching, suggesting that there is a difference in their metabolism of lipid reserves and/or in their temporal responses to bleaching and recovery.","Univ Penn, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",134,10.1007/s00227-004-1337-3,2004

However, their ultimate role in recruitment does not appear to be very important, suggesting a habitat-generated bottleneck that occurs between settlement and recruitment. Laboratory and field experiments show that newly settled crabs actively select refuges similar in size. Inside the reefs, decreases in crab density of each newly settled cohort mirror the ratio of decreases in the number of reef refuges of similar sizes, suggesting that habitat fractal structure determines the mortality rate after settlement. Field experiments using artificial shelters show that as crabs increase in size, they move outside reefs. Field tethering of juvenile- and adult-sized crabs without access to refuges showed that juvenile crabs suffer a much higher risk of mortality than adults. Our results show that the availability of small refuges provided by polychacte reefs enhances crab settlement, but, then, due to a decrease in the number of refuges as size increases, produces a demographic bottleneck during recruitment. Thus, independent of settlement intensity, enhanced survivorship in the smallest size classes due to refuge is not transmitted to larger size classes. This is likely one reason why stock-recruitment relationships may not hold in species that use shelters during both recently settled and juvenile life stages. These results provide a good example of why habitat enhancement programs need to incorporate a comprehensive evaluation of the species' ontogenic ecology to avoid class size-specific bottlenecks.","Univ Nacl Mar Plata, Dept Biol, FCEyN, Mar Del Plata, Argentina; Williams Coll Myst Seaport, Maritime Studies Program, Mystic, CT 06355 USA; Univ Nacl Mar Plata, CONICET, Mar Del Plata, Argentina",19,10.1007/s00227-004-1325-7,2004

Although algae are widely assumed to colonize and kill corals, there is very little known about the recruitment dynamics of coral reef algae. This study tested the ability of two dominant macroalgae (Fucales including Sargassum spp. and Lobophora variegata) to settle and grow on healthy coral tissue. The study also explored the effects of interactions with prior occupants, and of abiotic substrate properties (texture, and ceramic and carbonate material). The results indicate that healthy corals were able to prevent attachment or survival of recruits of these macroalgae. This is a significant point, since it suggests that the replacement of corals by algae may often require prior stress or death in the coral tissue. Pre-conditioning of plates at different sites had some effects, but these were relatively minor, whereas there was considerable variation within sites. Some of this variation appeared to be related to the amount of turf algae or crustose coralline algae on the plates. Recruitment was generally, but not always, higher on plates with rougher texture. Overall, this preliminary exploration indicates considerable potential for variability in outcomes of algal colonization, with implications for the dynamics of algal invasions. In particular, the results do not support suggestions that planktonic algal propagules can directly settle on and colonize healthy coral tissue.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Trop Biol, Dept Trop Plant Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville MC, Qld 4810, Australia; CRC Reef Res, Townsville MC, Qld 4810, Australia",46,10.1007/s00338-004-0370-5,2004

Modeled phytoplankton dynamics were strongly correlated with both freshwater nutrient inputs and wind-driven hydrodynamic processes, the latter resulting in a large input of oceanic water from the southeast part of the lagoon under trade wind conditions. In situ data obtained during the summer (January 1998) under trade wind conditions supported predicted concentration gradients along several coast to reef transects and provided a validation of the coupled physical-biogeochemical model.

Freshwater inputs of nutrients were simulated using a realistic scenario corresponding to the summer rainy season of 1997-1998 in New Caledonia. Despite occasional flooding events from the main rivers considered in these simulations, no significant meso-scale phytoplankton bloom was identified. Hydrodynamically driven dispersion and rapid uptake of nutrients by phytoplankton were sufficient to spatially constrain the impact of river inputs and maintain oligotrophic conditions. The fine spatial grid of our three-dimensional model demonstrated that eutrophication in the southwest lagoon of New Caledonia is confined to the most restricted coastal embayments, while most of the lagoon experiences sustained oligotrophic conditions.","Ctr Oceanol Marseille, Marine Endoume Stn, F-13007 Marseille, France; IRD, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia",25,10.1007/s00338-004-0378-x,2004

Coral reef fishes are regularly exposed to potentially harmful radiation. It was recently discovered that tropical marine fishes possess UV-absorbing compounds in their mucus. This experiment demonstrates significant effects of both diet and ultraviolet exposure on the UV-absorbing compounds in the mucus of a tropical wrasse, Thalassoma duperrey. Fish that are exposed to UV radiation increase the UV absorbance of their mucus only if UV-absorbing compounds are provided in their diet. Fish that are protected from UV radiation decrease the UV absorbance of their mucus regardless of diet. Mucus from female T. duperrey absorbed less UV and females had higher rates of skin damage than males. Females sequester UV-absorbing compounds in their pelagic eggs as well as their epithelial mucus, whereas males do not sequester these compounds in the testes. Spectral transmission through the whole eye was not affected by diet or UV manipulations, but corneal tissue transmission decreased significantly in the UV-exposed individuals. These results demonstrate that coral reef fish can adapt to UV exposure, so long as UV-absorbing compounds are available in the diet.","Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Zool, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA",29,10.1007/s00227-003-1286-2,2004

These tracts of bottom at 30-40 m comprise more than 4,500 km(2) of the region's reef area. The habitat was found to be dominated by algal meadows (65% cover of exposed bottom), with infrequent relief features. Annual monitoring of select stations for 4 years at Necker Bank indicated that the relative difference in algal abundance between stations persisted from year to year (at least in summer). Temperature records from year-long deployments of archival thermistors in high-cover (>70%) and low-cover (<30%) algal biotopes were indistinguishable, providing no explanation of the algal differences between stations. At all banks, Microdictyon was the primary alga, averaging 1.22 kg/m(2). In spite of the extensive standing primary production, and a historical lack of fishing, bank reef-fish populations were impoverished. Mean densities, sizes, and biomass of trophic groups were considerably less than values reported for NWHI reef shallows. An overall mean biomass was estimated at 22.5 g/m(2), which is a fifth of that reported for shallow reefs of the region. Fish biomass of all trophic groups was associated with the few sources of relief available on the banks. Apex predators (sharks, jacks, and snappers), common on all surveys (with a mean of five per station), were proposed to constrain fish populations to sparse sources of relief resulting in a skewed size structure of the two primary fish trophic components. Sizes of lower-level carnivores were tightly correlated with sources of relief whereas the size of herbivores were not, indicating that herbivores more often venture out and risk the exposed algal meadows. These bank summits are a rare example of a near pristine reef system with high benthic primary productivity and low fish biomass, and are a stark contrast to shallower coral-reef ecosystems of the NWHI.","NOAA, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",35,10.1007/s00227-003-1288-0,2004

Although a mouth full of eggs can be expected to pose a considerable respiratory problem, to our knowledge no study has examined respiratory consequences of mouthbrooding in fishes, or how hypoxia or strenuous swimming may affect the success of this reproductive strategy. In two species of cardinalfish (Apogon fragilis and Apogon leptacanthus), from the reef at Lizard Island (Great Barrier Reef), we found that mouthbrooding significantly reduced the ability to take up oxygen at low ambient oxygen levels. While the direct energetic cost of mouthbrooding appeared insignificant at rest in well-oxygenated water, mouthbrooding significantly reduced the respiratory scope of the fishes and their capacity for sustained aerobic swimming. The males spat out their eggs in hypoxia. Interestingly, the species with the larger brood, A. fragilis, spat out the brood at a higher water [O-2] than did A. leptacanthus, which had a smaller mean brood mass. Moreover, in contrast to mouthbrooding A. leptacanthus, mouthbrooding A. fragilis was unable to increase its ventilatory frequency in response to hypoxia. This suggests a trade-off situation between hypoxia tolerance and brood size. Apparently, A. fragilis has sacrificed hypoxia tolerance in favour of a large brood size to a greater extent than has A. leptacanthus.","Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; Univ Oslo, Dept Mol Biosci, N-0316 Oslo, Norway",24,10.1098/rspb.2004.2700,2004

The optical signature of a submerged reef substrate is both attenuated and augmented by the presence of the atmosphere and intervening water column, thereby complicating the link between field and space-borne measurement. The motivation of this manuscript is to quantify the advantage (defined as increase in classification accuracy) conferred by each of five levels of increasingly complex image processing methods to correct for atmospheric and submergence effects. It is found that the maximum overall classification accuracy attained in areas of the image where water depth is unknown was 53%, but with the addition of depth information, accuracy increases to 76%. The results demonstrate the ability of a classifier trained solely by in situ optical measurements to accurately resolve the broad substrate types of a typical Red Sea fringing reef top. Although slightly different accuracy assessment protocols were used, the results also suggest that using in situ spectra for training provided better classification results than using from-image statistics.","Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Earth & Life Sci, Dept Sedimentol, NL-1081 Amsterdam, Netherlands; Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, NL-1081 Amsterdam, Netherlands",61,10.1007/s00338-003-0351-0,2004

Spectral unmixing techniques have been successful in resolving subpixel areal cover in terrestrial environments. However, the application of spectral unmixing on coral reefs is fundamentally challenging, due not only to the water column, but also to the potentially large number of spectrally similar and ecologically significant end-member (substratum) classes involved. A controlled ex-situ experiment was conducted using field-spectrometer data to assess the accuracy of spectral unmixing techniques to estimate the areal cover of small-scale (<0.25 m(2)) assemblages of reef substrata (e.g., changes in cover between massive corals, branching corals, bleached corals, macroalgae, and coralline red algae). Mixture compositions were obtained precisely by analysis of digital images collected by a camera calibrated to the field of view of the spectrometer. Linear unmixing techniques were applied to derive estimates of substratum proportions using the full spectral resolution data and various transformations of it, including derivatives and down sampling (merging adjacent wavelengths into broader spectral bands). Comparison of actual and estimated substratum proportions indicate that spectral unmixing may be a practical approach for estimating subpixel-scale cover of coral reef substrata. In the most accurate treatment, coefficients of determination across all mixture sets were high for most end-member classes (37 of 52 cases with r(2) >0.64, i.e. r >0.8). The most successful analyses were based on derivatives of down-sampled data, implying that spectral unmixing benefits more from spectral smoothing and judicious choice of band locations than from high spectral resolution per se. Although these results show that changes in coral and algal cover can be determined by unmixing their spectra, the method is not yet an operational remote sensing tool. Primary empirical research is needed before taking the next step, which is to incorporate a water column, of variable depth, above the sea bed.","Univ Exeter, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, Hatherly Labs, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England; Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & ARchitecture, Biophys Remote Sensing Grp, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",50,10.1007/s00338-003-0354-x,2004

Coral R ranges in magnitude from similar to0.5% at 400 nm to near 100% at 700 nm; mean coral R rises from similar to2.5% at 400-500 nm to similar to8% between 550 and 650 nm. All corals measured in this study exhibit one of two basic shapes of R, which we label the ""brown"" and ""blue"" modes. We postulate that brown-mode R is determined by pigment absorption solely by zooxanthellae, while blue-mode R arises through expression of a non-fluorescing coral-host pigment. Taxonomic and geographic variabilities are approximately equal to global variability, both in magnitude and shape, indicating that coral R is independent of taxonomic or geographic differences.

Simultaneous measurements of turbidity depth-profile and above-water spectral reflectance integrated according Landsat 7 ETM+ band 2 spectral sensitivity provide a linear regression relationship for the southwest lagoon of New Caledonia (r(2)=0.95, n=40). This relationship is applied to an empirically atmospherically corrected Landsat ETM+ image of the lagoon acquired on October 23, 2002. A comparison between Landsat estimates of turbidity and concurrent measurements at 14 stations indicates that the mean standard error in the satellite-estimated turbidity is 17.5%. The numerical model introduced in Douillet et al. (2001) is used to simulate the transport of fine suspended sediments in the lagoon in October 2002. A calibration of the erosion rate coefficient required by the model is proposed using in situ turbidity profiles and the remotely sensed turbidity field. In situ data are used to tune locally the erosion rate coefficient, while satellite data are used to determine its spatial zonation.

This study measured spectral reflectance from 17 species of western Caribbean reef biota including coral, algae, seagrasses, and sediments, as well as healthy and diseased coral. It sought to extend the spectral library of reef-associated species found in the literature and to test the spectral discrimination of a hierarchy of habitats, community groups, and species. We compared results from hyperspectral reflectance and derivative datasets to those simulated for the three visible multispectral wavebands of the IKONOS sensor. The best discriminating subset of wavelengths was identified by multivariate stepwise selection procedure (discriminant function analysis). Best discrimination at all levels was obtained using the derivative dataset based on 6-15 non-contiguous wavebands depending on the level of the classification, followed by the hyperspectral reflectance dataset which was based on as few as 2-4 non-contiguous wavebands. IKONOS wavebands performed worst. The best discriminating subset of wavelengths in the three classification resolutions, and particularly those of the medium resolution, was in agreement with those identified by Hochberg and Atkinson (2003) and Hochberg et al. (2003) for reef communities worldwide. At all levels of classification, reflectance wavebands selected by the analysis were similar to those reported in recent studies carried out elsewhere, confirming their applicability in different biogeographical regions.

The total archipelagic area (all coral reef and lagoon habitats) of the 16 atolls, five oceanic faros, and four oceanic platform reefs which comprise the Maldives is 21,372.72+/-1,068.64 km(2) (approx. 20% of the Maldives' Territorial Sea). A total of 2,041+/-10 distinct coral reef structures larger than 0.01 km(2) occur in the Maldives, covering an area of 4,493.85 km(2) (including enclosed reef lagoons and islands) to 30-m depth. Smaller areas of coral reef substratum cover another 19.29 km(2), bringing the total area of Maldivian coral reefs to 4,513.14+/-225.65 km(2). Shallow coral platforms thus occupy 21.1% of the total area of the archipelago (0.0052% of the EEZ area of the Maldives). Of these reefs, 538 are rim and oceanic reefs, covering 3,701.93 km(2) (82.5% of the total reef area), and 1,503 are patch reefs within the atoll lagoons, covering 791.92 km(2) (17.5% of the total reef area). Islands occupy only 5.1% of the total reef area. Mapping the Maldives' coral reefs at high spatial resolution is only possible with remote sensing and spatial analysis technologies. These greatly reduce the large uncertainty around current estimates of reef area.

Pocilloporids were the most abundant coral recruits in all seasons. Recruitment was twofold higher during the first year than during the second year of study. There was considerable spatial variability, with the largest proportion of variance, apart from the error term, attributable to differences between sites, at a scale of 10(2) m. Spearman's ranked correlation showed consistency in spatial patterns of recruitment of pocilloporid corals between years, but not of acroporid corals. During spring, when only the brooding pocilloporid coral Stylophora pistillata reproduces at this locality, most coral recruitment occurred at central and southern sites adjacent to well-developed coral reefs. During summer, recruitment patterns varied significantly between years, with wide variation in the recruitment of broadcasting acroporid corals at northern sites located distant from coral reefs. Settlement was low at all sites during autumn and winter.

Physical and biological data indicate that relatively isolated populations of these fish exist. Genetic variation was assessed at four microsatellite loci in red grouper and six loci in scamp. The fish were collected on different dates between 1991 and 2001. The microsatellite loci were highly polymorphic, with an average expected heterozygosity of 0.75 in red grouper and 0.68 in scamp. Heterozygote deficiencies (significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, HWE) were found at two of four loci in all red grouper samples except the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and for all red grouper combined. In contrast, all loci conformed to HWE in the separate scamp samples. Minimal genetic differences distinguished southeastern U.S. Atlantic or Mexican red grouper from other localities, and no indication of genetic differentiation was observed in scamp. This large-scale genetic homogeneity may be attributed to ongoing gene flow and/or historical contact between present-day populations. For management purposes, genetic homogeneity does not necessarily imply a single stock. Because larval dispersal may be sufficient to homogenize gene frequencies but not to replenish depleted stocks, other data must be considered in the management of these species.","Marine Resources Res Inst, S Carolina Dept Nat Resources, Charleston, SC 29412 USA; Coll Charleston, Grice Marine Lab, Charleston, SC 29412 USA",24,10.1007/s00227-003-1236-z,2004

An unusual pattern of Mn concentration, which has not previously been reported in fish otoliths, was observed. Time-resolved plots (time roughly equivalent to ablation depth) of the Mn signal recorded in the ICP-MS detector during ablation of otoliths contained a distinct peak, suggesting that elevated Mn concentrations were specific to certain regions. Ablation inside and outside of the otolith core revealed that the region of high Mn concentration coincided with the ablation of the core. It was initially suggested that Mn from the gravel substrate on which herring eggs are incubated is incorporated into the otolith core, producing elevated Mn concentrations in this region. It was hypothesised that otoliths from fish whose eggs are not incubated in gravel will not contain high Mn concentrations at the core. To test this, otoliths of sprat (Sprattus sprattus), which have a pelagic embryological stage, and from reared herring, which were incubated on glass plates, were analysed using LA-ICP-MS. Peaks in the Mn signal were observed during the ablation of cores from some sprat and reared herring otoliths, indicating that incubation on a gravel substrate is not necessary for the accumulation of Mn at the otolith core and that otoliths from both pelagic and demersally spawning fish species can contain elevated Mn concentrations. The results suggest that Mn concentrations at the otolith core do not reflect the external environment of the developing embryo. Two other hypotheses are considered. A dramatic increase in Mn concentrations in the egg, associated with embryological development, may produce elevated Mn levels at the otolith core. Alternatively, the high levels of Mn observed at the otolith core may reflect spatial variation in the crystal structure of the calcium carbonate portion of the otolith. The possible influence of physiological or structural factors on the chemical composition of the otolith core may confound the environmental signal in this region of the otolith. This has important implications for the interpretation of otolith chemistry data.","Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Dublin, Dept Zool, Dublin 4, Ireland; Nat Hist Museum, Dept Mineral, London SW7 5BD, England",104,10.1007/s00227-003-1240-3,2004

Visual censuses of the distribution and abundance of labrids across two major gradients of wave exposure (depth and aspect to prevailing winds) were made at two offshore islands near Port Stephens, New South Wales, Australia. Distinct shifts in species composition and abundance were evident between high and low wave exposure habitats on temperate rocky reefs, particularly between deep and shallow habitats on exposed reef fronts. The swimming performances of temperate labrids were assessed through examination of pectoral fin shape (aspect ratio) and in situ swimming speeds. A diversity of pectoral fin morphologies was exhibited within this temperate assemblage, ranging from rounded to tapered fins (aspect ratios of 0.52 and 1.43, respectively). Fin shape was strongly correlated (Pearson's correlation 0.884, P<0.001) with swimming speed (ranging from 1.05 and 3.06 body lengths s(-1)), in a relationship comparable to that observed in tropical labrids. Inter-specific differences in swimming ability provided some explanation for differences in the distribution and abundance of temperate labrids in relation to wave exposure. However, our findings suggest that although coral reef labrids appear to predominantly use high aspect-ratio fins to successfully occupy wave-exposed habitats, temperate labrids appear to be using an enhanced swimming ability through increased body size.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Dept Marine Biol, Ctr Coral Reep Biodivers, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",57,10.1007/s00227-003-1216-3,2004

Indeed, most fishes appeared unaffected by hypoxia until the oxygen level fell below 10% of air saturation. This, hitherto unrecognized, hypoxia tolerance among coral reef fishes could reflect adaptations to nocturnal hypoxia in tide pools. It may also be needed to enable fishes to reside deep within branching coral at night to avoid predation.

Two closely related species, the bird-wrasses (Gomphosus varius Lacepede, 1801 and G. caerulaeus Lacepede, 1801), were also included in the analysis. These species grouped within the genus Thalassoma. Thalassoma newtoni (Osorio, 1891) from Sao Tome, which is generally synonymized with the Atlantic/Mediterranean Thalassoma pavo (Linnaeus, 1758) appears to be a valid species. Using a molecular clock, the genus was estimated to have originally diverged 8-13 million years ago, with Thalassoma ballieui (Vaillant and Sauvage, 1875) from Hawaii and Thalassoma septemfasciata Scott, 1959 from Western Australia as the ancestral species. Approximately 5-10 million years ago, a sudden burst of speciation resulted in seven clades, which were resolved with the sequence data. The terminal Tethyan event and the closing of the Isthmus of Panama were probably the major historical factors shaping the evolution of species in the genus Thalassoma. These data on the spatio-temporal pattern of speciation in the Indo-Pacific indicate that peripheral species have been generated at various times throughout the history of the genus, and that none of the widespread species are relatively young. Thus, there is no clear support for centrifugal (youngest at the periphery) versus centripetal (oldest at the periphery) modes of generation of species, two theories which have been used to account for geographic gradients in species diversity.","Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; Univ Naples 2, Dipartimento Sci Vita, I-81100 Caserta, Italy; Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama; Cornell Univ, Shoals Marine Lab, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",79,10.1007/s00227-003-1199-0,2004

Sampling was focused on the mid-Atlantic T. sanctaehelenae (Valenciennes, 1839) and T. ascensionis (Quoy & Gaimard, 1834), the eastern Atlantic T. newtoni (Osorio, 1891) from Sao Tome, and the eastern Atlantic/Mediterranean T. pavo (Linnaeus, 1758). Two western Atlantic species T. bifasciatum (Bloch, 1791) from the Caribbean and T. noronhanum (Boulenger, 1890) from Brazil served as outgroups. Tissues from a total of 132 individuals were sequenced. T. newtoni from Sao Tome preferentially grouped with the central Atlantic T. sanctaehelenae and T. ascensionis. T. pavo exhibits two distinct coloration patterns, one in the Cape Verde Islands and one in the eastern Atlantic Islands and Mediterranean. However, no genetic discontinuities between the Cape Verde Islands and the remaining samples or between Atlantic and Mediterranean individuals were found. Within Mediterranean populations of T. pavo, our data suggested the presence of a genetic break between eastern and western regions.","Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; Univ Naples 2, Dipartimento Sci Vita, I-81100 Caserta, Italy; Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama; Univ Lecce, CoNISMa, DiSTeBA, Lab Zool & Marine Biol, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; Univ Acores, Dept Oceanog & Pesca, Ctr IMAR, PT-99018862 Horta Azores, Portugal; Univ Algarve, Ctr Ciencias Mar, P-8000117 Faro, Portugal; Cornell Univ, Shoals Marine Lab, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",36,10.1007/s00227-003-1200-y,2004
1674,"Hindell, JS; Jenkins, GP",Spatial and temporal variability in the assemblage structure of fishes associated with mangroves (Avicennia marina) and intertidal mudflats in temperate Australian embayments,MARINE BIOLOGY,COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; SPECIES COMPOSITION; JUVENILE FISH; SHALLOW-WATER; CORAL-REEF; ESTUARINE DEPENDENCE; UNVEGETATED HABITATS; SOUTHERN AUSTRALIA; TROPICAL AUSTRALIA; TROPHIC ECOLOGY,"Fishes using mangrove (Avicennia marina) and mudflat habitat were sampled using three different types of gear (seine, fyke, and gill nets) at three sites within each of two large embayments through time (quarterly) between January 2002 and November 2002. At least 41 species of fish were sampled, of which 78% were marine, 17% were estuarine, and 5% were freshwater. Juveniles were sampled in 41% of the species, and 5 and 6 species occurred exclusively in mangrove and mudflat habitats, respectively. The assemblage structure of fishes varied significantly between habitats (for both fyke and seine catches) and between spring and summer (seine catches), but only in one bay. Most of the variability between habitats and times of the year could be explained by differences in abundances of atherinids, mugulids, gobiids, tetraodontids, pleuronectids, and clupeids. Fyke nets sampled mainly juvenile and smaller species of fish. Fish abundance was always greater in mangroves than mudflats (but significantly so at four of the six study sites) and varied significantly between times of the year at one site, while the number of species varied significantly between times of the year at three sites. Gill nets sampled mostly adult/subadult fishes and abundances were greater in mudflats than mangroves at two sites, and in mangroves over mudflats at one site, while species abundance varied between times of the year at two sites. The seine net sampled mainly early post-settlement and small (<20 mm) fishes, more species of which were sampled in mudflat than mangrove during winter and spring, whereas the opposite pattern occurred in summer and autumn. The number of fish sampled with the seine net only varied significantly between habitats in one embayment during summer and spring, when they were larger and smaller, respectively, in mangroves than mudflats. Mangrove habitat in temperate Australian waters supports a richer juvenile fish assemblage than adjacent mudflats, but there is little difference between habitats for the subadult/adult assemblage. Ultimately, the 'value' of mangrove habitats to fishes depends strongly on when and where (bays and sites within bays) the study is done.","Univ Melbourne, Primary Ind Res Victoria, Queenscliff 3225, Australia; Univ Melbourne, Dept Zool, Queenscliff 3225, Australia",45,10.1007/s00227-003-1201-x,2004
1675,"de la Moriniere, EC; Nagelkerken, I; van der Meij, H; van der Velde, G",What attracts juvenile coral reef fish to mangroves: habitat complexity or shade?,MARINE BIOLOGY,SHALLOW-WATER BIOTOPES; CARIBBEAN BAY; ESTUARINE; SEAGRASS; LUTJANIDAE; HAEMULIDAE; COMMUNITY; PATTERNS; SHIFTS,"The value of mangroves for fish species is usually explained in terms of high food abundance or shelter against predators as a result of high turbidity and structural complexity. In a field experiment, artificial mangrove units (AMUs) were designed as open cages, each of which was provided with a different degree of structural complexity and shade. Fish species that were attracted to the AMUs were identified and counted and the effects of shade and structural complexity, as well as the interaction between the two factors, were tested. Diurnal fish showed a preference for the greatest structured complexity and for a moderate increase in shade. Two nocturnal species common in local mangroves as well as seagrass beds showed statistically significant effects: densities of Haemulon sciurus were positively related to both shade and structural complexity, whereas only shade had a significant positive effect on densities of Ocyurus chrysurus. The experiment indicated that the attractiveness of mangrove vegetation for H. sciurus may be influenced by the structural complexity of the habitat as well as by the degree of shade, and that both factors are equally and separately important. Individuals of O. chrysurus that are attracted to mangroves are more likely to be influenced by the presence of shade than by the degree of structural complexity. The data thus indicated that the positive relationship between fish densities in mangrove habitats and the degree of shade and structural complexity, or both, is species-specific.","Univ Nijmegen, Dept Anim Ecol & Ecophysiol, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands; Carmabi Fdn, Curacao, Neth Antilles; SAcion Univ Profess Educ, Inst Spatial Planning & Environm Sci, NL-7400 AM Deventer, Netherlands",71,10.1007/s00227-003-1167-8,2004
