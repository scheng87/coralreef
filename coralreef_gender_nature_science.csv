Most mechanisms for glacial-interglacial CO2 change have centred on carbon exchange with the deep ocean, owing to its large size and relatively rapid exchange with the atmosphere(1). The Southern Ocean is thought to have a key role in this exchange, as much of the deep ocean is ventilated to the atmosphere in this region(2). However, it is difficult to reconstruct changes in deep Southern Ocean carbon storage, so few direct tests of this hypothesis have been carried out. Here we present deep-sea coral boron isotope data that track the pH-and thus the CO2 chemistry-of the deep Southern Ocean over the past forty thousand years. At sites closest to the Antarctic continental margin, and most influenced by the deep southern waters that form the ocean's lower overturning cell, we find a close relationship between ocean pH and atmospheric CO2: during intervals of low CO2, ocean pH is low, reflecting enhanced ocean carbon storage; and during intervals of rising CO2, ocean pH rises, reflecting loss of carbon from the ocean to the atmosphere. Correspondingly, at shallower sites we find rapid (millennial-to centennial-scale) decreases in pH during abrupt increases in CO2, reflecting the rapid transfer of carbon from the deep ocean to the upper ocean and atmosphere. Our findings confirm the importance of the deep Southern Ocean in ice-age CO2 change, and show that deep-ocean CO2 release can occur as a dynamic feedback to rapid climate change on centennial timescales.","[Rae, J.

How local impacts scale up across affected regions depends on numerous factors, including patchiness in coral mortality, metabolic effects of extreme temperatures on populations of reef-dwelling species(4) and interactions between taxa. Here we use data from before and after the 2016 mass bleaching event to evaluate ecological changes in corals, algae, fishes and mobile invertebrates at 186 sites along the full latitudinal span of the Great Barrier Reef and western Coral Sea. One year after the bleaching event, reductions in live coral cover of up to 51% were observed on surveyed reefs that experienced extreme temperatures; however, regional patterns of coral mortality were patchy. Consistent declines in coral-feeding fishes were evident at the most heavily affected reefs, whereas few other short-term responses of reef fishes and invertebrates could be attributed directly to changes in coral cover. Nevertheless, substantial region-wide ecological changes occurred that were mostly independent of coral loss, and instead appeared to be linked directly to sea temperatures. Community-wide trophic restructuring was evident, with weakening of strong pre-existing latitudinal gradients in the diversity of fishes, invertebrates and their functional groups. In particular, fishes that scrape algae from reef surfaces, which are considered to be important for recovery after bleaching(2), declined on northern reefs, whereas other herbivorous groups increased on southern reefs. The full impact of the 2016 bleaching event may not be realized until dead corals erode during the next decade(5,6) . However, our short-term observations suggest that the recovery processes, and the ultimate scale of impact, are affected by functional changes in communities, which in turn depend on the thermal affinities of local reef-associated fauna. Such changes will vary geographically, and may be particularly acute at locations where many fishes and invertebrates are close to their thermal distribution limits(7).","[Stuart-Smith, Rick D.; Edgar, Graham J.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Brown, Christopher J.] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Ceccarelli, Daniela M.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia",8,10.1038/s41586-018-0359-9,2018

Relative to the Holocene epoch, atmospheric carbon dioxide was about 100 parts per million lower and tropical sea surface temperatures were about 3 to 5 degrees Celsius lower(2,3). The Last Glacial Maximum began when global mean sea level (GMSL) abruptly dropped by about 40 metres around 31,000 years ago(4) and was followed by about 10,000 years of rapid deglaciation into the Holocene(1). The masses of the melting polar ice sheets and the change in ocean volume, and hence in GMSL, are primary constraints for climate models constructed to describe the transition between the Last Glacial Maximum and the Holocene, and future changes; but the rate, timing and magnitude of this transition remain uncertain. Here we show that sea level at the shelf edge of the Great Barrier Reef dropped by around 20 metres between 21,900 and 20,500 years ago, to-118 metres relative to the modern level. Our findings are based on recovered and radiometrically dated fossil corals and coralline algae assemblages, and represent relative sea level at the Great Barrier Reef, rather than GMSL. Subsequently, relative sea level rose at a rate of about 3.5 millimetres per year for around 4,000 years. The rise is consistent with the warming previously observed at 19,000 years ago(1,5), but we now show that it occurred just after the 20-metre drop in relative sea level and the related increase in global ice volumes. The detailed structure of our record is robust because the Great Barrier Reef is remote from former ice sheets and tectonic activity. Relative sea level can be influenced by Earth's response to regional changes in ice and water loadings and may differ greatly from GMSL. Consequently, we used glacio-isostatic models to derive GMSL, and find that the Last Glacial Maximum culminated 20,500 years ago in a GMSL low of about - 125 to - 130 metres.","[Yokoyama, Yusuke; Miyairi, Yosuke; Sawada, Chikako; Aze, Takahiro] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan; [Yokoyama, Yusuke] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Yokoyama, Yusuke] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan; [Esat, Tezer M.; Fallon, Stewart] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Esat, Tezer M.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Phys & Engn, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Thompson, William G.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Thomas, Alexander L.] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Webster, Jody M.] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Matsuzaki, Hiroyuki] Univ Tokyo, Univ Museum, Tokyo, Japan; [Okuno, Jun'ichi] Natl Inst Polar Res, Tokyo, Japan; [Braga, Juan-Carlos] Univ Granada, Granada, Spain; [Humblet, Marc] Nagoya Univ, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan; [Iryu, Yasufumi] Tohoku Univ, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Potts, Donald C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Fujita, Kazuhiko] Univ Ryukyus, Naha, Japan; [Suzuki, Atsushi] Geol Survey Japan, Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol AIST, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Kan, Hironobu] Kyushu Univ, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan",7,10.1038/s41586-018-0335-4,2018

Mesophotic coral reefs (at depths of 30 to 150 meters) have been widely hypothesized to provide refuge from natural and anthropogenic impacts, a promise for the survival of shallow reefs. The potential role of mesophotic reefs as universal refuges is often highlighted in reef conservation research. This hypothesis rests on two assumptions: (i) that there is considerable overlap in species composition and connectivity between shallow and deep populations and (ii) that deep reefs are less susceptible to anthropogenic and natural impacts than their shallower counterparts. Here we present evidence contradicting these assumptions and argue that mesophotic reefs are distinct, impacted, and in as much need of protection as shallow coral reefs.","[Rocha, Luiz A.; Pinheiro, Hudson T.; Shepherd, Bart; Bongaerts, Pim] Calif Acad Sci, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA; [Papastamatiou, Yannis P.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Luiz, Osmar J.] Charles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Darwin, NT 0810, Australia; [Pyle, Richard L.] Bernice P Bishop Museum, Honolulu, HI 96817 USA; [Bongaerts, Pim] Univ Queensland, Global Change Inst, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",13,10.1126/science.aaq1614,2018

When abundant, seabirds feeding in the open ocean transport large quantities of nutrients onto islands, enhancing the productivity of island fauna and flora(3,4). Whether leaching of these nutrients back into the sea influences the productivity, structure and functioning of adjacent coral reef ecosystems is not known. Here we address this question using a rare natural experiment in the Chagos Archipelago, in which some islands are rat-infested and others are rat-free. We found that seabird densities and nitrogen deposition rates are 760 and 251 times higher, respectively, on islands where humans have not introduced rats. Consequently, rat-free islands had substantially higher nitrogen stable isotope (delta N-15) values in soils and shrubs, reflecting pelagic nutrient sources. These higher values of delta N-15 were also apparent in macroalgae, filter-feeding sponges, turf algae and fish on adjacent coral reefs. Herbivorous damselfish on reefs adjacent to the rat-free islands grew faster, and fish communities had higher biomass across trophic feeding groups, with 48% greater overall biomass. Rates of two critical ecosystem functions, grazing and bioerosion, were 3.2 and 3.8 times higher, respectively, adjacent to rat-free islands. Collectively, these results reveal how rat introductions disrupt nutrient flows among pelagic, island and coral reef ecosystems. Thus, rat eradication on oceanic islands should be a high conservation priority as it is likely to benefit terrestrial ecosystems and enhance coral reef productivity and functioning by restoring seabird-derived nutrient subsidies from large areas of ocean.","[Graham, Nicholas A.

Although many reefs retain accretion rates close to recent SLR trends, few will have the capacity to track SLR projections under RCP4.5 scenarios without sustained ecological recovery, and under RCP8.5 scenarios most reefs are predicted to experience mean water depth increases of more than 0.5 m by 2100.

Here we show that in the aftermath of the record-breaking marine heatwave on the Great Barrier Reef in 2016(2), corals began to die immediately on reefs where the accumulated heat exposure exceeded a critical threshold of degree heating weeks, which was 3-4 degrees C-weeks. After eight months, an exposure of 6 degrees C-weeks or more drove an unprecedented, regional-scale shift in the composition of coral assemblages, reflecting markedly divergent responses to heat stress by different taxa. Fast-growing staghorn and tabular corals suffered a catastrophic die-off, transforming the three-dimensionality and ecological functioning of 29% of the 3,863 reefs comprising the world's largest coral reef system. Our study bridges the gap between the theory and practice of assessing the risk of ecosystem collapse, under the emerging framework for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Ecosystems(3), by rigorously defining both the initial and collapsed states, identifying the major driver of change, and establishing quantitative collapse thresholds. The increasing prevalence of post-bleaching mass mortality of corals represents a radical shift in the disturbance regimes of tropical reefs, both adding to and far exceeding the influence of recurrent cyclones and other local pulse events, presenting a fundamental challenge to the long-term future of these iconic ecosystems.","[Hughes, Terry P.; Kerry, James T.; Baird, Andrew H.; Connolly, Sean R.; Dietzel, Andreas; Hoey, Andrew S.; Hoogenboom, Mia O.; McWilliam, Michael J.; Pratchett, Morgan S.; Torda, Gergely] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Connolly, Sean R.; Hoogenboom, Mia O.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Eakin, C.

The underlying architecture of a reef is a biogenic carbonate structure that accretes over many years of active biomineralizat ion by calcifying organisms, including corals and algae(2). Ocean acidification poses a chronic threat to coral reefs by reducing the saturation state of the aragonite mineral of which coral skeletons are primarily composed, and lowering the concentration of carbonate ions required to maintain the carbonate reef. Reduced calcification, coupled with increased bioerosion and dissolution(3), may drive reefs into a state of net loss this century(4). Our ability to predict changes in ecosystem function and associated services ultimately hinges on our understanding of community- and ecosystem-scale responses. Past research has primarily focused on the responses of individual species rather than evaluating more complex, community-level responses. Here we use an in situ carbon dioxide enrichment experiment to quantify the net calcification response of a coral reef flat to acidification. We present an estimate of community-scale calcification sensitivity to ocean acidification that is, to our knowledge, the first to be based on a controlled experiment in the natural environment.

The latter causes the 'aragonite saturation horizon'-below which waters are undersaturated with respect to a particular calcium carbonate, aragonite-to move to shallower depths (to shoal), exposing corals to corrosive waters(2,3). Here we use a database analysis to show that the present rate of supply of acidified waters to the deep Atlantic could cause the aragonite saturation horizon to shoal by 1,000-1,700 metres in the subpolar North Atlantic within the next three decades. We find that, during 1991-2016, a decrease in the concentration of carbonate ions in the Irminger Sea caused the aragonite saturation horizon to shoal by about 10-15 metres per year, and the volume of aragonite-saturated waters to reduce concomitantly. Our determination of the transport of the excess of carbonate over aragonite saturation ((XC)[CO32-])-an indicator of the availability of aragonite to organisms-by the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation shows that the present-day transport of carbonate ions towards the deep ocean is about 44 per cent lower than it was in preindustrial times. We infer that a doubling of atmospheric anthropogenic CO2 levels-which could occur within three decades according to a 'business-as-usual scenario' for climate change 4-could reduce the transport of (XC)[CO32-] by 64-79 per cent of that in preindustrial times, which could severely endanger cold-water coral habitats. The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation would also export this acidified deep water southwards, spreading corrosive waters to the world ocean.","[Perez, Fiz F.; Fontela, Marcos; Garcia-Ibanez, Maribel I.; Velo, Anton; de la Paz, Mercedes; Alonso-Perez, Fernando; Guallart, Elisa E.; Padin, Xose A.] CSIC, IIM, Calle Eduardo Cabello 6, Vigo 36208, Spain; [Mercier, Herle; Lherminier, Pascale; Zunino, Patricia] Univ Brest, CNRS,Ifremer, Inst Rech Dev, LOPS,Ctr Ifremer Bretagne, F-29280 Plouzane, France",6,10.1038/nature25493,2018

The likelihood of disease increases from 4% to 89% when corals are in contact with plastic. Structurally complex corals are eight times more likely to be affected by plastic, suggesting that microhabitats for reef-associated organisms and valuable fisheries will be disproportionately affected. Plastic levels on coral reefs correspond to estimates of terrestrial mismanaged plastic waste entering the ocean. We estimate that 11.1 billion plastic items are entangled on coral reefs across the Asia-Pacific and project this number to increase 40% by 2025.

There are two prevailing hypotheses: that it is a physicochemically dominated process and that it is a biologically mediated one. Using a combination of ultrahigh-resolution three-dimensional imaging and two-dimensional solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we show that mineral deposition is biologically driven. Randomly arranged, amorphous nanoparticles are initially deposited in microenvironments enriched in organic material; they then aggregate and form ordered aragonitic structures through crystal growth by particle attachment. Our NMR results are consistent with heterogeneous nucleation of the solid mineral phase driven by coral acid-rich proteins.

Here we sequenced genomes of COTS from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia and Okinawa, Japan to identify gene products that underlie species-specific communication and could potentially be used in biocontrol strategies. We focused on water-borne chemical plumes released from aggregating COTS, which make the normally sedentary starfish become highly active. Peptide sequences detected in these plumes by mass spectrometry are encoded in the COTS genome and expressed in external tissues. The exoproteome released by aggregating COTS consists largely of signalling factors and hydrolytic enzymes, and includes an expanded and rapidly evolving set of starfish-specific ependymin-related proteins. These secreted proteins may be detected by members of a large family of olfactory-receptor-like G-protein-coupled receptors that are expressed externally, sometimes in a sex-specific manner. This study provides insights into COTS-specific communication that may guide the generation of peptide mimetics for use on reefs with COTS outbreaks.","[Hall, Michael R.; Motti, Cherie A.; Bose, Utpal] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Cape Ferguson, PMB 3, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Kocot, Kevin M.; Fernandez-Valverde, Selene L.; Gauthier, Marie E.

We suggest that ocean mixing and early deglacial release of excess U-234 from enhanced subglacial melting of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets have driven the observed U-234/U-238 evolution.","[Chen, Tianyu; Robinson, Laura F.; Beasley, Matthew P.; Claxton, Louis M.] Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Bristol Isotope Grp, Bristol, Avon, England; [Andersen, Morten B.] ETH, Dept Earth Sci, Inst Geochem & Petr, Zurich, Switzerland; [Andersen, Morten B.] Cardiff Univ, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Gregoire, Lauren J.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Wadham, Jemma] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol Glaciol Ctr, Bristol, Avon, England; [Fornari, Daniel J.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Geol & Geophys, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Harpp, Karen S.] Colgate Univ, Dept Geol, 13 Oak Dr, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA",8,10.1126/science.aag1015,2016

A presently unexplored approach that draws on theory and practice in human health and rural development(4,5) is to systematically identify and learn from the 'outliers'-places where ecosystems are substantially better ('bright spots') or worse ('dark spots') than expected, given the environmental conditions and socioeconomic drivers they are exposed to. Here we compile data from more than 2,500 reefs worldwide and develop a Bayesian hierarchical model to generate expectations of how standing stocks of reef fish biomass are related to 18 socioeconomic drivers and environmental conditions. We identify 15 bright spots and 35 dark spots among our global survey of coral reefs, defined as sites that have biomass levels more than two standard deviations from expectations. Importantly, bright spots are not simply comprised of remote areas with low fishing pressure; they include localities where human populations and use of ecosystem resources is high, potentially providing insights into how communities have successfully confronted strong drivers of change. Conversely, dark spots are not necessarily the sites with the lowest absolute biomass and even include some remote, uninhabited locations often considered near pristine(6). We surveyed local experts about social, institutional, and environmental conditions at these sites to reveal that bright spots are characterized by strong sociocultural institutions such as customary taboos and marine tenure, high levels of local engagement in management, high dependence on marine resources, and beneficial environmental conditions such as deep-water refuges. Alternatively, dark spots are characterized by intensive capture and storage technology and a recent history of environmental shocks. Our results suggest that investments in strengthening fisheries governance, particularly aspects such as participation and property rights, could facilitate innovative conservation actions that help communities defy expectations of global reef degradation.","[Cinner, Joshua E.; Huchery, Cindy; MacNeil, M.

We show that 75% of past thermal stress events have been characterized by a temperature trajectory that subjects corals to a protective, sub-bleaching stress, before reaching temperatures that cause bleaching. Such conditions confer thermal tolerance, decreasing coral cell mortality and symbiont loss during bleaching by over 50%. We find that near-future increases in local temperature of as little as 0.5 degrees C result in this protective mechanism being lost, which may increase the rate of degradation of the GBR.","[Ainsworth, Tracy D.; Ogawa, Daisie; Leggat, William] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Heron, Scott F.; Eakin, C.

Less clear is how temperate viruses, which coexist and replicate with their host, influence microbial communities. Here we show that virus-like particles are relatively less abundant at high host densities. This suggests suppressed lysis where established models predict lytic dynamics are favoured. Meta-analysis of published viral and microbial densities showed that this trend was widespread in diverse ecosystems ranging from soil to freshwater to human lungs. Experimental manipulations showed viral densities more consistent with temperate than lytic life cycles at increasing microbial abundance. An analysis of 24 coral reef viromes showed a relative increase in the abundance of hallmark genes encoded by temperate viruses with increased microbial abundance. Based on these four lines of evidence, we propose the Piggyback-the-Winner model wherein temperate dynamics become increasingly important in ecosystems with high microbial densities; thus 'more microbes, fewer viruses'.","[Knowles, B.; Silveira, C.

This process, referred to as ocean acidification, represents a major threat to marine ecosystems, in particular marine calcifiers such as oysters, crabs, and corals. Laboratory and field studies(2,3) have shown that calcification rates of many organisms decrease with declining pH, [CO32-], and Omega. Coral reefs are widely regarded as one of the most vulnerable marine ecosystems to ocean acidification, in part because the very architecture of the ecosystem is reliant on carbonate-secreting organisms(4). Acidification-induced reductions in calcification are projected to shift coral reefs from a state of net accretion to one of net dissolution this century(5). While retrospective studies show large-scale declines in coral, and community, calcification over recent decades(6-12), determining the contribution of ocean acidification to these changes is difficult, if not impossible, owing to the confounding effects of other environmental factors such as temperature. Here we quantify the net calcification response of a coral reef flat to alkalinity enrichment, and show that, when ocean chemistry is restored closer to pre-industrial conditions, net community calcification increases. In providing results from the first seawater chemistry manipulation experiment of a natural coral reef community, we provide evidence that net community calcification is depressed compared with values expected for pre-industrial conditions, indicating that ocean acidification may already be impairing coral reef growth.","[Albright, Rebecca; Caldeira, Lilian; Kwiatkowski, Lester; Maclaren, Jana K.; Nebuchina, Yana; Pongratz, Julia; Ricke, Katharine L.; Schneider, Kenneth; Sesbouee, Marine; Zhu, Kai; Caldeira, Ken] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hosfelt, Jessica; Ninokawa, Aaron] Univ Calif Davis, Bodega Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA; [Maclaren, Jana K.] Stanford Univ, Stanford Nano Shared Facil, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Mason, Benjamin M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Genet, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Pongratz, Julia] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Bundesstr 53, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Ricke, Katharine L.] Cornell Univ, Sibley Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Rivlin, Tanya] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Interuniv Inst Marine Sci, H Steinitz Marine Biol Lab, Elat, Israel; [Rivlin, Tanya] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fredy & Nadine Herrman Inst Earth Sci, Edmond J Safra Campus, Jerusalem, Israel; [Schneider, Kenneth] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Robert H Smith Fac Agr Food & Environm, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Shamberger, Kathryn] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Shamberger, Kathryn] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Silverman, Jacob] Inst Oceanog & Limnol Res, Haifa, Israel; [Wolfe, Kennedy] Univ Sydney, Sch Med Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Zhu, Kai] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Zhu, Kai] Rice Univ, Dept BioSci, Houston, TX 77005 USA",79,10.1038/nature17155,2016

We found biochemical complementarity between genomes of S. kawagutii and the anthozoan Acropora, indicative of host-symbiont coevolution, providing a resource for studying the molecular basis and evolution of coral symbiosis.","[Lin, Senjie; Lin, Xin; Li, Ling; Zhang, Yaqun; Shi, Xinguo; Lin, Lingxiao; Wang, Lu; Meng, Shanshan] Xiamen Univ, State Key Lab Marine Environm Sci & Marine Biodiv, Xiamen 361101, Peoples R China; [Lin, Senjie; Lin, Xin; Li, Ling; Zhang, Yaqun; Shi, Xinguo; Lin, Lingxiao; Wang, Lu; Meng, Shanshan] Xiamen Univ, Global Change Res Ctr, Xiamen 361101, Peoples R China; [Lin, Senjie; Zhang, Huan; Zhuang, Yunyun] Univ Connecticut, Dept Marine Sci, Groton, CT 06340 USA; [Cheng, Shifeng; Song, Bo; Zhong, Xiao; Li, Wujiao; Wang, Zhaobao; Liu, Xin; Yu, Sheng; Zeng, Peng; Chen, Chengxuan; Li, Yanjun; Wang, Ying; Xu, Chunyan; Xu, Xun; Wang, Jun; Yang, Huanming] Beijing Genom Inst BGI Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Shifeng] Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong Univ HKU BGI Bioinformat Algorithms & C, Dept Comp Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Shifeng] Univ Hong Kong, Sch Biol Sci, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ji, Zhiliang; Cai, Meichun; Zou, Quan] Xiamen Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Stress Cell Biol, Xiamen 361101, Peoples R China; [Hao, Han] Agcy Sci Technol & Res, Bioinformat Inst, Singapore, Singapore; [Wang, Jun] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Wang, Jun; Yang, Huanming] King Abdulaziz Univ, Princess Al Jawhara Ctr Excellence Res Hereditary, Jeddah 21413, Saudi Arabia; [Yang, Huanming] James D Watson Inst Genome Sci, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Campbell, David A.; Sturm, Nancy R.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Mol Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Dagenais-Bellefeuille, Steve; Morse, David] Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, Inst Rech Biol Vegetale, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada",132,10.1126/science.aad0408,2015

Mangrove forests have the capacity to keep pace with sea-level rise and to avoid inundation through vertical accretion of sediments, which allows them to maintain wetland soil elevations suitable for plant growth(3). The Indo-Pacific region holds most of the world's mangrove forests(4), but sediment delivery in this region is declining, owing to anthropogenic activities such as damming of rivers(5). This decline is of particular concern because the Indo-Pacific region is expected to have variable, but high, rates of future sea-level rise(6,7). Here we analyse recent trends in mangrove surface elevation changes across the Indo-Pacific region using data from a network of surface elevation table instruments(8-10). We find that sediment availability can enable mangrove forests to maintain rates of soil-surface elevation gain that match or exceed that of sea-level rise, but for 69 per cent of our study sites the current rate of sea-level rise exceeded the soil surface elevation gain. We also present a model based on our field data, which suggests that mangrove forests at sites with low tidal range and low sediment supply could be submerged as early as 2070.","[Lovelock, Catherine E.; Reef, Ruth; Swales, Andrew] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Lovelock, Catherine E.; Reef, Ruth; Saunders, Megan L.] Univ Queensland, Global Change Inst, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Cahoon, Donald R.; Guntenspergen, Glenn R.] US Geol Survey, Patuxent Wildlife Res Ctr, Laurel, MD 20708 USA; [Friess, Daniel A.] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, Singapore 117570, Singapore; [Reef, Ruth] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge Coastal Res Unit, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; [Rogers, Kerrylee] Univ Wollongong, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Sidik, Frida] Minist Marine Affairs & Fisheries, Inst Marine Res & Observat, Bali 82251, Indonesia; [Swales, Andrew] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Hamilton 3251, New Zealand; [Saintilan, Neil] Macquarie Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Thuyen, Le Xuan; Triet, Tran] Vietnam Natl Univ, Univ Sci, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",130,10.1038/nature15538,2015

Fishing is the primary source of diminished reef function globally(3-5), leading to widespread calls for additional marine reserves to recover fish biomass and restore key ecosystem functions(6). Yet there are no established baselines for determining when these conservation objectives have been met or whether alternative management strategies provide similar ecosystem benefits. Here we establish empirical conservation benchmarks and fish biomass recovery timelines against which coral reefs can be assessed and managed by studying the recovery potential of more than 800 coral reefs along an exploitation gradient. We show that resident reef fish biomass in the absence of fishing (B-0) averages similar to 1,000 kg ha(-1), and that the vast majority (83%) of fished reefs are missing more than half their expected biomass, with severe consequences for key ecosystem functions such as predation. Given protection from fishing, reef fish biomass has the potential to recover within 35 years on average and less than 60 years when heavily depleted. Notably, alternative fisheries restrictions are largely (64%) successful at maintaining biomass above 50% of B-0, sustaining key functions such as herbivory. Our results demonstrate that crucial ecosystem functions can be maintained through a range of fisheries restrictions, allowing coral reef managers to develop recovery plans that meet conservation and livelihood objectives in areas where marine reserves are not socially or politically feasible solutions.","[MacNeil, M.

Conditions under which reefs bounce back from bleaching events or shift from coral to algal dominance are unknown, making it difficult to predict and plan for differing reef responses under climate change(2). Herewe document and predict long-term reef responses to a major climate-induced coral bleaching event that caused unprecedented region-wide mortality of Indo-Pacific corals. Following loss of >90% live coral cover, 12 of 21 reefs recovered towards pre-disturbance live coral states, while nine reefs underwent regime shifts to fleshy macroalgae. Functional diversity of associated reef fish communities shifted substantially following bleaching, returning towards pre-disturbance structure on recovering reefs, while becoming progressively altered on regime shifting reefs. We identified threshold values for a range of factors that accurately predicted ecosystem response to the bleaching event. Recovery was favoured when reefs were structurally complex and in deeper water, when density of juvenile corals and herbivorous fishes was relatively high and when nutrient loads were low. Whether reefs were inside no-take marine reserves had no bearing on ecosystem trajectory. Although conditions governing regime shift or recovery dynamics were diverse, pre-disturbance quantification of simple factors such as structural complexity and water depth accurately predicted ecosystem trajectories. These findings foreshadow the likely divergent but predictable outcomes for reef ecosystems in response to climate change, thus guiding improved management and adaptation.","[Graham, Nicholas A.

Chemical cues of specific seaweeds from degraded reefs repulsed recruits, and cues from specific corals that are typical of healthy reefs attracted recruits.

Currently, there is little evidence that wild animals can acquire resistance to these pathogens(5). Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is a pathogenic fungus implicated in the recent global decline of amphibians(6). Here we demonstrate that three species of amphibians can acquire behavioural or immunological resistance to B. dendrobatidis. Frogs learned to avoid the fungus after just one B. dendrobatidis exposure and temperature-induced clearance. In subsequent experiments in which B. dendrobatidis avoidance was prevented, the number of previous exposures was a negative predictor of B. dendrobatidis burden on frogs and B. dendrobatidis-induced mortality, and was a positive predictor of lymphocyte abundance and proliferation. These results suggest that amphibians can acquire immunity to B. dendrobatidis that overcomes pathogen-induced immunosuppression(7-9) and increases their survival. Importantly, exposure to dead fungus induced a similar magnitude of acquired resistance as exposure to live fungus. Exposure of frogs to B. dendrobatidis antigens might offer a practical way to protect pathogen-naive amphibians and facilitate the reintroduction of amphibians to locations in the wild where B. dendrobatidis persists. Moreover, given the conserved nature of vertebrate immune responses to fungi(5) and the fact that many animals are capable of learning to avoid natural enemies(10), these results offer hope that other wild animal taxa threatened by invasive fungi might be rescued by management approaches based on herd immunity.","[McMahon, Taegan A.; Sears, Brittany F.; Bessler, Scott M.; Brown, Jenise M.; Deutsch, Kaitlin; Halstead, Neal T.; Lentz, Garrett; Tenouri, Nadia; Young, Suzanne; Civitello, David J.; Ortega, Nicole; Rohr, Jason R.] Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [McMahon, Taegan A.] Univ Tampa, Dept Biol, Tampa, FL 33606 USA; [Venesky, Matthew D.] Allegheny Coll, Dept Biol, Meadville, PA 16335 USA; [Fites, J.

The abrupt temperature rise in the Northern Hemisphere and the restart of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation at the start of the Bolling-Allerod interstadial, 14,700 years ago, are among the most dramatic deglacial events(3), but their underlying physical causes are not known. Here we show that the release of heat from warm waters in the deep North Atlantic Ocean probably triggered the Bolling-Allerod warming and reinvigoration of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. Our results are based on coupled radiocarbon and uranium-series dates, along with clumped isotope temperature estimates, from water column profiles of fossil deep-sea corals in a limited area of the western North Atlantic. We find that during Heinrich stadial 1 (the cool period immediately before the Bolling-Allerod interstadial), the deep ocean was about three degrees Celsius warmer than shallower waters above. This reversal of the ocean's usual thermal stratification pre-dates the Bolling-Allerod warming and must have been associated with increased salinity at depth to preserve the static stability of the water column. The depleted radiocarbon content of the warm and salty water mass implies a long-term disconnect from rapid surface exchanges, and, although uncertainties remain, is most consistent with a Southern Ocean source. The Heinrich stadial 1 ocean profile is distinct from the modern water column, that for the Last Glacial Maximum and that for the Younger Dryas, suggesting that the patterns we observe are a unique feature of the deglacial climate system. Our observations indicate that the deep ocean influenced dramatic Northern Hemisphere warming by storing heat at depth that preconditioned the system for a subsequent abrupt overturning event during the Bolling-Allerod interstadial.","[Thiagarajan, Nivedita; Subhas, Adam V.; Eiler, John M.; Adkins, Jess F.] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Southon, John R.] Univ Calif Irvine, Earth Syst Sci Dept, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",39,10.1038/nature13472,2014

To determine the mechanisms of temperature tolerance, we reciprocally transplanted corals between reef sites experiencing distinct temperature regimes and tested subsequent physiological and gene expression profiles. Local acclimatization and fixed effects, such as adaptation, contributed about equally to heat tolerance and are reflected in patterns of gene expression. In less than 2 years, acclimatization achieves the same heat tolerance that we would expect from strong natural selection over many generations for these long-lived organisms. Our results show both short-term acclimatory and longer-term adaptive acquisition of climate resistance.

Contrary to our expectations, we did not detect systematic loss of alpha diversity. However, community composition changed systematically through time, in excess of predictions from null models.

Primary production in the NPSG has increased in recent decades despite a reduction in nutrient supply to surface waters(2,3). It is thought that this apparent paradox can be explained by a shift in plankton community structure from mostly eukaryotes to mostly nitrogen-fixing prokaryotes(2-4). It remains uncertain, however, whether the plankton community domain shift can be linked to cyclical climate variability or a long-term global warming trend(5). Here we analyse records of bulk and amino-acid-specific N-15/N-14 isotopic ratios (delta N-15) preserved in the skeletons of long-lived deep-sea proteinaceous corals collected from the Hawaiian archipelago; these isotopic records serve as a proxy for the source of nitrogen-supported export production through time. We find that the recent increase in nitrogen fixation is the continuation of a much larger, centennial-scale trend. After a millennium of relatively minor fluctuation, delta N-15 decreases between 1850 and the present. The total shift in delta N-15 of -2 per mil over this period is comparable to the total change in global mean sedimentary delta N-15 across the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, but it is happening an order of magnitude faster(6). We use a steady-state model and find that the isotopic mass balance between nitrate and nitrogen fixation implies a 17 to 27 per cent increase in nitrogen fixation over this time period. A comparison with independent records(7,8) suggests that the increase in nitrogen fixation might be linked to Northern Hemisphere climate change since the end of the Little Ice Age.","[Sherwood, Owen A.; Guilderson, Thomas P.; Batista, Fabian C.; Schiff, John T.; McCarthy, Matthew D.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ocean Sci Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Guilderson, Thomas P.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; [Guilderson, Thomas P.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",36,10.1038/nature12784,2014

Combining chemical, genomic and molecular approaches, we show that coral juveniles produce DMSP in the absence of algal symbionts. DMSP levels increased up to 54% over time in newly settled coral juveniles lacking algal endosymbionts, and further increases, up to 76%, were recorded when juveniles were subjected to thermal stress. We uncovered coral orthologues of two algal genes recently identified in DMSP biosynthesis, strongly indicating that corals possess the enzymatic machinery necessary for DMSP production. Our results overturn the paradigm that photosynthetic organisms are the sole biological source of DMSP, and highlight the double jeopardy represented by worldwide declining coral cover, as the potential to alleviate thermal stress through coral-produced DMSP declines correspondingly.","[Raina, Jean-Baptiste; Lutz, Adrian; Seneca, Francois O.; Willis, Bette L.] James Cook Univ, AIMS JCU, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Raina, Jean-Baptiste; Seneca, Francois O.; Willis, Bette L.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Raina, Jean-Baptiste; Tapiolas, Dianne M.; Lutz, Adrian; Abrego, David; Seneca, Francois O.; Bourne, David G.; Motti, Cherie A.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Raina, Jean-Baptiste; Foret, Sylvain; Lutz, Adrian; Willis, Bette L.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Foret, Sylvain] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Lutz, Adrian] James Cook Univ, Sch Pharm & Mol Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Ceh, Janja] Murdoch Univ, Sch Biol Sci & Biotechnol, Perth, WA 6050, Australia; [Clode, Peta L.] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Microscopy Characterisat & Anal, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Clode, Peta L.] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",101,10.1038/nature12677,2013

This ""sponge loop"" was confirmed in aquarium and in situ food web experiments, using C-13- and N-15-enriched DOM.

Controversy about the amplitude and timing of this meltwater pulse (MWP-1A) has, however, led to uncertainty about the source of the melt water and its temporal and causal relationships with the abrupt climate changes of the deglaciation. Here we show that MWP-1A started no earlier than 14,650 years ago and ended before 14,310 years ago, making it coeval with the Bolling warming. Our results, based on corals drilled offshore from Tahiti during Integrated Ocean Drilling Project Expedition 310, reveal that the increase in sea level at Tahiti was between 12 and 22 metres, with a most probable value between 14 and 18 metres, establishing a significant meltwater contribution from the Southern Hemisphere. This implies that the rate of eustatic sea-level rise exceeded 40 millimetres per year during MWP-1A.","[Deschamps, Pierre; Durand, Nicolas; Bard, Edouard; Hamelin, Bruno; Camoin, Gilbert] UMR Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, IRD, Coll France,CEREGE, F-13545 Aix En Provence 4, France; [Thomas, Alexander L.; Henderson, Gideon M.] Dept Earth Sci, Oxford OX1 3AN, England; [Okuno, Jun'ichi; Yokoyama, Yusuke] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778564, Japan; [Okuno, Jun'ichi; Yokoyama, Yusuke] Univ Tokyo, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778564, Japan; [Okuno, Jun'ichi] Natl Inst Polar Res, Tachikawa, Tokyo 1908518, Japan; [Yokoyama, Yusuke] JAMSTEC, Inst Biogeosci, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 2370061, Japan",252,10.1038/nature10902,2012

This depletion and associated deep stratification disappeared by similar to 14.6 ka (thousand years ago), consistent with the transfer of carbon from the deep ocean to the surface ocean and atmosphere via a Southern Ocean ventilation event.

We show there is no widespread pattern of consistent decline in calcification rates of massive Porites during the 20th century on reefs spanning an 11 degrees latitudinal range in the southeast Indian Ocean off Western Australia. Increasing calcification rates on the high-latitude reefs contrast with the downward trajectory reported for corals on Australia's Great Barrier Reef and provide additional evidence that recent changes in coral calcification are responses to temperature rather than ocean acidification.,"[Cooper, Timothy F.; O'Leary, Rebecca A.] Univ Western Australia, Australian Inst Marine Sci, Oceans Inst, Crawley 6009, Australia; [Lough, Janice M.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia",85,10.1126/science.1214570,2012

Plant-derived irritants have predominated in this regard, but animal venoms have also evolved to avert predators by targeting neurons and receptors whose activation produces noxious sensations(2-6). As such, venoms provide a rich and varied source of small molecule and protein pharmacophores(7,8) that can be exploited to characterize and manipulate key components of the pain-signalling pathway. With this in mind, here we perform an unbiased in vitro screen to identify snake venoms capable of activating somatosensory neurons. Venom from the Texas coral snake (Micrurus tener tener), whose bite produces intense and unremitting pain(9), excites a large cohort of sensory neurons. The purified active species (MitTx) consists of a heteromeric complex between Kunitz- and phospholipase-A2-like proteins that together function as a potent, persistent and selective agonist for acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), showing equal or greater efficacy compared with acidic pH. MitTx is highly selective for the ASIC1 subtype at neutral pH; under more acidic conditions (pH < 6.5), MitTx massively potenti ates (>100-fold) proton-evoked activation of ASIC2a channels. These observations raise the possibility that ASIC channels function as coincidence detectors for extracellular protons and other, as yet unidentified, endogenous factors. Purified MitTx elicits robust pain-related behaviour in mice by activation of ASIC1 channels on capsaicin-sensitive nerve fibres. These findings reveal a mechanism whereby snake venoms produce pain, and highlight an unexpected contribution of ASIC1 channels to nociception.","[Bohlen, Christopher J.; Chesler, Alexander T.; Julius, David] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Sharif-Naeini, Reza; Basbaum, Allan I.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Anat, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Medzihradszky, Katalin F.; Burlingame, Alma L.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Zhou, Sharleen; King, David] Univ Calif Berkeley, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Mass Spectrometry Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sanchez, Elda E.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Chem, Kingsville, TX 78363 USA; [Sanchez, Elda E.] Texas A&M Univ, Natl Nat Toxins Res Ctr, Kingsville, TX 78363 USA",165,10.1038/nature10607,2011

To understand better the molecular mechanisms underlying coral biology, here we decoded the approximately 420-megabase genome of Acropora digitifera using next-generation sequencing technology. This genome contains approximately 23,700 gene models. Molecular phylogenetics indicate that the coral and the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis diverged approximately 500 million years ago, considerably earlier than the time over which modern corals are represented in the fossil record (similar to 240 million years ago)(5). Despite the long evolutionary history of the endosymbiosis, no evidence was found for horizontal transfer of genes from symbiont to host. However, unlike several other corals, Acropora seems to lack an enzyme essential for cysteine biosynthesis, implying dependency of this coral on its symbionts for this amino acid. Corals inhabit environments where they are frequently exposed to high levels of solar radiation, and analysis of the Acropora genome data indicates that the coral host can independently carry out de novo synthesis of mycosporine-like amino acids, which are potent ultraviolet-protective compounds. In addition, the coral innate immunity repertoire is notably more complex than that of the sea anemone, indicating that some of these genes may have roles in symbiosis or coloniality. A number of genes with putative roles in calcification were identified, and several of these are restricted to corals. The coral genome provides a platform for understanding the molecular basis of symbiosis and responses to environmental changes.","[Shinzato, Chuya; Shoguchi, Eiichi; Kawashima, Takeshi; Hamada, Mayuko; Hisata, Kanako; Tanaka, Makiko; Fujiwara, Mayuki; Koyanagi, Ryo; Ikuta, Tetsuro; Satoh, Nori] Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol Promot Corp, Marine Genom Unit, Okinawa 9040412, Japan; [Fujiyama, Asao] Natl Inst Genet, Mishima, Shizuoka 4118540, Japan; [Fujie, Manabu] Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol Promot Corp, DNA Sequencing Ctr Sect, Okinawa 9040412, Japan; [Miller, David J.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Miller, David J.] James Cook Univ, Sch Pharm & Mol Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",389,10.1038/nature10249,2011

This leads to ocean acidification, one of the major threats to marine ecosystems(2) and particularly to calcifying organisms such as corals(3,4), foraminifera(5-7) and coccolithophores(8). Coccolithophores are abundant phytoplankton that are responsible for a large part of modern oceanic carbonate production. Culture experiments investigating the physiological response of coccolithophore calcification to increased CO(2) have yielded contradictory results between and even within species(8-11). Here we quantified the calcite mass of dominant coccolithophores in the present ocean and over the past forty thousand years, and found a marked pattern of decreasing calcification with increasing partial pressure of CO(2) and concomitant decreasing concentrations of CO(3)(2-). Our analyses revealed that differentially calcified species and morphotypes are distributed in the ocean according to carbonate chemistry. A substantial impact on the marine carbon cycle might be expected upon extrapolation of this correlation to predicted ocean acidification in the future.

This suggests that during the PWP, when global mean temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were similar to those projected for near-term climate change(2), ENSO variability-and related global climate teleconnections-could have been radically different from that today. Yet, owing to a lack of observational evidence on seasonal and interannual SST variability from crucial low-latitude sites, this fundamental climate characteristic of the PWP remains controversial(1,3-10). Here we show that permanent El Nino conditions did not exist during the PWP. Our spectral analysis of the delta(18)O SST and salinity proxy, extracted from two 35-year, monthly resolved PWP Porites corals in the Philippines, reveals variability that is similar to present ENSO variation. Although our fossil corals cannot be directly compared with modern ENSO records, two lines of evidence suggest that Philippine corals are appropriate ENSO proxies. First, delta(18)O anomalies from a nearby live Porites coral are correlated with modern records of ENSO variability. Second, negative-delta(18)O events in the fossil corals closely resemble the decreases in delta(18)O seen in the live coral during El Nino events. Prior research advocating a permanent El Nino state may have been limited by the coarse resolution of many SST proxies, whereas our coral-based analysis identifies climate variability at the temporal scale required to resolve ENSO structure firmly.","[Watanabe, Tsuyoshi; Minobe, Shoshiro; Kawashima, Tatsunori; Sowa, Kohki; Nagai, Takaya] Hokkaido Univ, Dept Nat Hist Sci, Fac Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan; [Suzuki, Atsushi; Minoshima, Kayo] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Geol Survey Japan, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058567, Japan; [Kameo, Koji] Chiba Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Fac Sci, Chiba 2638522, Japan; [Aguilar, Yolanda M.] Mines & Geosci Bur, Petrolab, Quezon City 1101, Philippines; [Wani, Ryoji] Yokohama Natl Univ, Interdisciplinary Res Ctr, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan; [Kawahata, Hodaka] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba 2775564, Japan; [Kase, Tomoki] Natl Museum Nat & Sci, Dept Geol & Paleontol, Tokyo 1690073, Japan",69,10.1038/nature09777,2011

Distinct characteristics in the carbon isotope signatures of the major carbon reservoirs (ocean, biosphere, sediments and atmosphere) constrain variations in the CO2 fluxes between those reservoirs. Here we present a highly resolved atmospheric delta C-13 record for the past 11,000 years from measurements on atmospheric CO2 trapped in an Antarctic ice core. From mass-balance inverse model calculations(3,4) performed with a simplified carbon cycle model, we show that the decrease in atmospheric CO2 of about 5 parts per million by volume (p.p.m.v.). The increase in delta C-13 of about 0.25 parts per thousand during the early Holocene is most probably the result of a combination of carbon uptake of about 290 gigatonnes of carbon by the land biosphere and carbon release from the ocean in response to carbonate compensation of the terrestrial uptake during the termination of the last ice age. The 20 p.p.m.v. increase of atmospheric CO2 and the small decrease in delta C-13 of about 0.05 parts per thousand during the later Holocene can mostly be explained by contributions from carbonate compensation of earlier land-biosphere uptake and coral reef formation, with only a minor contribution from a small decrease of the land-biosphere carbon inventory.","[Elsig, Joachim; Schmitt, Jochen; Leuenberger, Daiana; Schneider, Robert; Eyer, Marc; Leuenberger, Markus; Joos, Fortunat; Fischer, Hubertus; Stocker, Thomas F.] Univ Bern, Inst Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Elsig, Joachim; Schmitt, Jochen; Leuenberger, Daiana; Schneider, Robert; Eyer, Marc; Leuenberger, Markus; Joos, Fortunat; Fischer, Hubertus; Stocker, Thomas F.] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Schmitt, Jochen; Fischer, Hubertus] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res AWI, D-27568 Bremerhaven, Germany",118,10.1038/nature08393,2009

This indicates that the penultimate deglaciation occurred earlier with respect to NHI than the last deglacial, beginning when NHI was at a minimum.","[Thomas, Alex L.; Henderson, Gideon M.; Mason, Andrew J.] Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, Oxford OX1 3PR, England; [Deschamps, Pierre; Bard, Edouard; Hamelin, Bruno; Durand, Nicolas; Camoin, Gilbert] Aix Marseille Univ, CEREGE UMR 6635, CNRS, IRD,Coll France, F-13545 Aix En Provence, France; [Yokoyama, Yusuke] Univ Tokyo, Ocean Res Inst, Tokyo 1648639, Japan; [Yokoyama, Yusuke] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Yokoyama, Yusuke] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Inst Res Earth Evolut, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 2370061, Japan",83,10.1126/science.1168754,2009

We now show that a bacteriophytochrome from Deinococcus radiodurans, incorporating biliverdin as the chromophore, can be engineered into monomeric, infrared-fluorescent proteins (IFPs), with excitation and emission maxima of 684 and 708 nm, respectively; extinction coefficient >90,000 M-1 cm(-1); and quantum yield of 0.07. IFPs express well in mammalian cells and mice and spontaneously incorporate biliverdin, which is ubiquitous as the initial intermediate in heme catabolism but has negligible fluorescence by itself. Because their wavelengths penetrate tissue well, IFPs are suitable for whole-body imaging. The IFPs developed here provide a scaffold for further engineering.","[Shu, Xiaokun; Steinbach, Paul A.; Tsien, Roger Y.] Univ Calif San Diego, Howard Hughes Med Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Shu, Xiaokun; Lin, Michael Z.; Aguilera, Todd A.; Lev-Ram, Varda; Steinbach, Paul A.; Tsien, Roger Y.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pharmacol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Royant, Antoine] Inst Biol Struct 41, F-38027 Grenoble 1, France; [Tsien, Roger Y.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Chem, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Tsien, Roger Y.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Biochem, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",423,10.1126/science.1168683,2009

The rate of this projected rise is based on ice-sheet melting simulations and downplays discoveries of more rapid ice loss(2,3). Knowing the rate at which sea level reached its highstand during the last interglacial period is fundamental in assessing if such rapid ice-loss processes could lead to future catastrophic sea-level rise. The best direct record of sea level during this highstand comes from well-dated fossil reefs in stable areas(4-6). However, this record lacks both reef-crest development up to the full highstand elevation, as inferred(7) from widespread intertidal indicators at +6m, and a detailed chronology, owing to the difficulty of replicating U-series ages on submillennial timescales(8). Here we present a complete reef-crest sequence for the last interglacial highstand and its U-series chronology from the stable northeast Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. We find that reef development during the highstand was punctuated by reef-crest demise at +3m and back-stepping to +6m. The abrupt demise of the lower-reef crest, but continuous accretion between the lower-lagoonal unit and the upper-reef crest, allows us to infer that this back-stepping occurred on an ecological timescale and was triggered by a 2-3-m jump in sea level. Using strictly reliable Th-230 ages of corals from the upper-reef crest, and improved stratigraphic screening of coral ages from other stable sites, we constrain this jump to have occurred similar to 121 kyr ago and conclude that it supports an episode of ice-sheet instability during the terminal phase of the last interglacial period.","[Blanchon, Paul] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Marine & Limnol Sci, Cancun, Quintana Roo, Mexico; [Eisenhauer, Anton; Fietzke, Jan; Liebetrau, Volker] IFM GEOMAR, Leibniz Inst Marine Sci, D-24148 Kiel, Germany",124,10.1038/nature07933,2009

We investigated 328 colonies of massive Porites corals from 69 reefs of the Great Barrier Reef ( GBR) in Australia. Their skeletal records show that throughout the GBR, calcification has declined by 14.2% since 1990, predominantly because extension ( linear growth) has declined by 13.3%. The data suggest that such a severe and sudden decline in calcification is unprecedented in at least the past 400 years. Calcification increases linearly with increasing large- scale sea surface temperature but responds nonlinearly to annual temperature anomalies. The causes of the decline remain unknown; however, this study suggests that increasing temperature stress and a declining saturation state of seawater aragonite may be diminishing the ability of GBR corals to deposit calcium carbonate.","[De'ath, Glenn; Lough, Janice M.; Fabricius, Katharina E.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia",382,10.1126/science.1165283,2009

Although allene oxide synthase ( AOS) and hydroperoxide lyase are atypical cytochrome P450 family members involved in the synthesis of jasmonates and GLVs, respectively, it is unknown how these enzymes rearrange their hydroperoxide substrates into different products. Here we present the crystal structures of Arabidopsis thaliana AOS, free and in complex with substrate or intermediate analogues. The structures reveal an unusual active site poised to control the reactivity of an epoxyallylic radical and its cation by means of interactions with an aromatic pi- system. Replacing the amino acid involved in these steps by a non- polar residue markedly reduces AOS activity and, unexpectedly, is both necessary and sufficient for converting AOS into a GLV biosynthetic enzyme. Furthermore, by combining our structural data with bioinformatic and biochemical analyses, we have discovered previously unknown hydroperoxide lyase in plant growth- promoting rhizobacteria, AOS in coral, and epoxyalcohol synthase in amphioxus. These results indicate that oxylipin biosynthetic genes were present in the last common ancestor of plants and animals, but were subsequently lost in all metazoan lineages except Placozoa, Cnidaria and Cephalochordata.","[Lee, Dong-Sun; Raman, C.

The oceans are a principal sink for anthropogenic CO(2) where it is estimated to have caused a 30% increase in the concentration of H(+) in ocean surface waters since the early 1900s and may lead to a drop in seawater pH of up to 0.5 units by 2100 ( refs 2, 3). Our understanding of how increased ocean acidity may affect marine ecosystems is at present very limited as almost all studies have been in vitro, short- term, rapid perturbation experiments on isolated elements of the ecosystem(4,5). Here we show the effects of acidification on benthic ecosystems at shallow coastal sites where volcanic CO(2) vents lower the pH of the water column. Along gradients of normal pH ( 8.1 - 8.2) to lowered pH ( mean 7.8 - 7.9, minimum 7.4 - 7.5), typical rocky shore communities with abundant calcareous organisms shifted to communities lacking scleractinian corals with significant reductions in sea urchin and coralline algal abundance. To our knowledge, this is the first ecosystem- scale validation of predictions that these important groups of organisms are susceptible to elevated amounts of p(CO2). Sea- grass production was highest in an area at mean pH 7.6 ( 1,827 mu atm p(CO2)) where coralline algal biomass was significantly reduced and gastropod shells were dissolving due to periods of carbonate sub- saturation. The species populating the vent sites comprise a suite of organisms that are resilient to naturally high concentrations of p(CO2) and indicate that ocean acidification may benefit highly invasive non- native algal species. Our results provide the first in situ insights into how shallow water marine communities might change when susceptible organisms are removed owing to ocean acidification.","[Hall-Spencer, Jason M.; Rodolfo-Metalpa, Riccardo; Ransome, Emma; Rowley, Sonia J.] Univ Plymouth, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, Inst Marine, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Martin, Sophie] Univ Paris 06, CNRS, F-06234 Villefranche Sur Mer, France; [Fine, Maoz] Bar Ilan Univ, Fac Life Sci, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Fine, Maoz] Interuniv Inst Marine Sci, IL-88103 Elat, Israel; [Turner, Suzanne M.] Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Tedesco, Dario] Univ Naples 2, Dept Environm Sci, I-81100 Caserta, Italy; [Tedesco, Dario] CNR, Ist Geol Ambientale & Geoingn, I-00138 Rome, Italy; [Buia, Maria-Cristina] Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Lab Ecol Benthos, I-80077 Naples, Italy",709,10.1038/nature07051,2008

Because predators would not be under selection to avoid the model and any of its look- alikes in areas where the model is absent ( that is, allopatry)(2-5), batesian mimics should occur only in sympatry with their model. However, contrary to this expectation, batesian mimics often occur in allopatry(6-8). Here we focus on one such example - a coral snake mimic(3,8). Using indirect DNA- based methods, we provide evidence suggesting that mimics migrate from sympatry, where mimicry is favoured(3,9), to allopatry, where it is disfavoured(10). Such gene flow is much stronger in nuclear genes than in maternally inherited mitochondrial genes, indicating that dispersal by males may explain the presence of mimetic phenotypes in allopatry. Despite this gene flow, however, individuals from allopatry resemble the model less than do individuals from sympatry. We show that this breakdown of mimicry probably reflects predator- mediated selection acting against individuals expressing the more conspicuous mimetic phenotype in allopatry. Thus, although gene flow may explain why batesian mimics occur in allopatry, natural selection may often override such gene flow and promote the evolution of non- mimetic phenotypes in such areas.","[Harper, George R., Jr.; Pfennig, David W.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",32,10.1038/nature06532,2008

However, our survey of wave attenuation data from field studies of mangroves, salt marshes, seagrass beds, nearshore coral reefs, and sand dunes reveals that these relationships are rarely linear. By incorporating nonlinear wave attenuation in estimating coastal protection values of mangroves in Thailand, we show that the optimal land use option may instead be the integration of development and conservation consistent with ecosystem- based management goals. This result suggests that reconciling competing demands on coastal habitats should not always result in stark preservation- versus- conversion choices.","[Barbier, Edward B.; Kennedy, Chris J.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Koch, Evamaria W.] Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Horn Point Lab, Cambridge, MD 21613 USA; [Silliman, Brian R.] Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Hacker, Sally D.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Wolanski, Eric] James Cook Univ N Queensland, Australian Ctr Trop Freshwater Res, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Wolanski, Eric] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Primavera, Jurgenne] SE Asian Fisheries Dev Ctr, Dept Aquaculture, Iloilo 5021, Philippines; [Granek, Elise F.] Portland State Univ, Portland, OR 97207 USA; [Polasky, Stephen; Bael, David] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Aswani, Shankar] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Anthropol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Cramer, Lori A.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Sociol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Stoms, David M.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Kappel, Carrie V.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA; [Perillo, Gerardo M.

The result will be less diverse reef communities and carbonate reef structures that fail to be maintained. Climate change also exacerbates local stresses from declining water quality and overexploitation of key species, driving reefs increasingly toward the tipping point for functional collapse. This review presents future scenarios for coral reefs that predict increasingly serious consequences for reef- associated fisheries, tourism, coastal protection, and people.

Unlike many problems in physics, the nature of the interactions in ecological communities is not completely known. Although most contemporary theories in ecology start with the basic premise that species interact, here we show that a theory in which all interspecific interactions are turned off leads to analytical results that are in agreement with RSA data from tropical forests and coral reefs. The assumption of non-interacting species leads to a sampling theory for the RSA that yields a simple approximation at large scales to the exact theory. Our results show that one can make significant theoretical progress in ecology by assuming that the effective interactions among species are weak in the stationary states in species-rich communities such as tropical forests and coral reefs.","Penn State Univ, Dept Phys, Davey Lab 104, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, Ctr Infect Dis Dynam, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, APO, AA 34002 USA; Univ Padua, Dipartimento Fis G Galilei, CNISM, I-35131 Padua, Italy; Ist Nazl Fis Nucl, I-35131 Padua, Italy",148,10.1038/nature06197,2007

Reefs in the Caribbean are among the most heavily affected(2,3), having experienced mass disease-induced mortality of the herbivorous urchin Diadema antillarum(4) in 1983 and two framework-building species of coral(5). Declining reef health is characterized by increases in macroalgae. A critical question is whether the observed macroalgal bloom on Caribbean reefs is easily reversible. To answer this question, we must resolve whether algal-dominated reefs are an alternative stable state of the ecosystem or simply the readily reversible result of a phase change along a gradient of some environmental or ecological parameter(6). Here, using a fully parameterized simulation model in combination with a simple analytical model, we show that Caribbean reefs became susceptible to alternative stable states once the urchin mortality event of 1983 confined the majority of grazing to parrotfishes. We reveal dramatic hysteresis in a natural system(7,8) and define critical thresholds of grazing and coral cover beyond which resilience is lost. Most grazing thresholds lie near the upper level observed for parrotfishes in nature, suggesting that reefs are highly sensitive to parrotfish exploitation. Ecosystem thresholds can be combined with stochastic models of disturbance to identify targets for the restoration of ecosystem processes. We illustrate this principle by estimating the relationship between current reef state (coral cover and grazing) and the probability that the reef will withstand moderate hurricane intensity for two decades without becoming entrained in a shift towards a stable macroalgal-dominated state. Such targets may help reef managers face the challenge of addressing global disturbance at local scales.","Univ Exeter, Sch Biosci, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England; Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA",429,10.1038/nature06252,2007

Once captured, prey are carried by water movement inside the oral cavity to a second set of jaws in the throat, the pharyngeal jaws, which manipulate the prey and assist in swallowing(1,2). Moray eels display much less effective suction-feeding abilities(3). Given this reduction in a feeding mechanism that is widespread and highly conserved in aquatic vertebrates, it is not known how moray eels swallow large fish and cephalopods(4-7). Here we show that the moray eel (Muraena retifera) overcomes reduced suction capacity by launching raptorial pharyngeal jaws out of its throat and into its oral cavity, where the jaws grasp the struggling prey animal and transport it back to the throat and into the oesophagus. This is the first described case of a vertebrate using a second set of jaws to both restrain and transport prey, and is the only alternative to the hydraulic prey transport reported in teleost fishes. The extreme mobility of the moray pharyngeal jaws is made possible by elongation of the muscles that control the jaws(8), coupled with reduction of adjacent gill-arch structures(9). The discovery that pharyngeal jaws can reach up from behind the skull to grasp prey in the oral jaws reveals a major innovation that may have contributed to the success of moray eels as apex predators hunting within the complex matrix of coral reefs(10,11). This alternative prey transport mode is mechanically similar to the ratcheting mechanisms used in snakes(12,13)-a group of terrestrial vertebrates that share striking morphological, behavioural(14) and ecological convergence with moray eels.","Univ Calif Davis, Sect Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA",39,10.1038/nature06062,2007

Changes in the frequency and intensity of hurricanes in the past can provide insights into the factors that influence hurricane activity, but reliable observations of hurricane activity in the North Atlantic only cover the past few decades(2). Here we construct a record of the frequency of major Atlantic hurricanes over the past 270 years using proxy records of vertical wind shear and sea surface temperature ( the main controls on the formation of major hurricanes kin this region(1,3-5)) from corals and a marine sediment core. The record indicates that the average frequency of major hurricanes decreased gradually from the 1760s until the early 1990s, reaching anomalously low values during the 1970s and 1980s. Furthermore, the phase of enhanced hurricane activity since 1995 is not unusual compared to other periods of high hurricane activity in the record and thus appears to represent a recovery to normal hurricane activity, rather than a direct response to increasing sea surface temperature. Comparison of the record with a reconstruction of vertical wind shear indicates that variability in this parameter primarily controlled the frequency of major hurricanes in the Atlantic over the past 270 years, suggesting that changes in the magnitude of vertical wind shear will have a significant influence on future hurricane activity.","Geol Survey Sweden, SE-75128 Uppsala, Sweden; Univ Gothenburg, Dept Earth Sci, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Phys, Mayaguez, PR 00681 USA; Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33707 USA; NOAA, Earth Syst Res Lab, Phys Sci Div R PSD1, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; Univ Texas, Dept Geol Sci, Jackson Sch Geosci, Austin, TX 78712 USA; Univ Texas, Inst Geophys, Austin, TX 78758 USA",91,10.1038/nature05895,2007

There is much debate about how the IOD interacts with the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Asian monsoon, and recent changes in the historic ENSO - monsoon relationship(6) raise the possibility that the properties of the IOD may also be evolving. Improving our understanding of IOD events and their climatic impacts thus requires the development of records defining IOD activity in different climatic settings, including prehistoric times when ENSO and the Asian monsoon behaved differently from the present day. Here we use coral geochemical records from the equatorial eastern Indian Ocean to reconstruct surface-ocean cooling and drought during individual IOD events over the past similar to 6,500 years. We find that IOD events during the middle Holocene were characterized by a longer duration of strong surface ocean cooling, together with droughts that peaked later than those expected by El Nino forcing alone. Climate model simulations suggest that this enhanced cooling and drying was the result of strong cross-equatorial winds driven by the strengthened Asian monsoon of the middle Holocene.

Here we integrate predictions from oceanographic models(9) with engineering theory, to predict the dislodgement of benthic reef corals during hydrodynamic disturbances. This generalizes earlier work(10,11), by incorporating colonies of any shape and by explicitly examining the effects of hydrodynamic gradients on coral assemblage structure. Afield test shows that this model accurately predicts changes in the mechanical vulnerability of coral colonies, and thus their size and shape, with distance from the reef crest. This work provides a general framework for understanding and predicting the effects of hydrodynamic disturbances on coral reef communities; such disturbances have a major role in determining species zonation(12,13) and coexistence(14) on coral reefs, and are critical determinants of how coral assemblages will respond to changes in the frequency and intensity of tropical storms associated with a changing climate(3-5,15).","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ N Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA",158,10.1038/nature05328,2006

With continued global warming, bleaching events are predicted to increase in frequency and severity, causing up to 60% coral mortality globally within the next few decades(4-6). Although some corals are able to recover and to survive bleaching(7,8), the mechanisms underlying such resilience are poorly understood. Here we show that the coral host has a significant role in recovery and resilience. Bleached and recovering Montipora capitata (branching) corals met more than 100% of their daily metabolic energy requirements by markedly increasing their feeding rates and CHAR (per cent contribution of heterotrophically acquired carbon to daily animal respiration), whereas Porites compressa (branching) and Porites lobata (mounding) corals did not. These findings suggest that coral species with high-CHAR capability during bleaching and recovery, irrespective of morphology, will be more resilient to bleaching events over the long term, could become the dominant coral species on reefs, and may help to safeguard affected reefs from potential local and global extinction.","Ohio State Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; Villanova Univ, Dept Biol, Villanova, PA 19085 USA; Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA",342,10.1038/nature04565,2006

Here we report estimates of the ground displacement associated with this event, using near-field Global Positioning System ( GPS) surveys in northwestern Sumatra combined with in situ and remote observations of the vertical motion of coral reefs. These data show that the earthquake was generated by rupture of the Sunda subduction megathrust over a distance of >1,500 kilometres and a width of,150 kilometres.

The neutral theory, which assumes that individuals are demographically identical regardless of species, seeks to explain ubiquitous features of community structure and biodiversity patterns(3-5). Here we present a test of neutral-theory predictions with the use of an extensive species-level data set of Indo-Pacific coral communities. We show that coral assemblages differ markedly from neutral-model predictions for patterns of community similarity and the relative abundance of species. Within local communities, neutral models do not fit relative abundance distributions as well as the classical log-normal distribution. Relative abundances of species across local communities also differ markedly from neutral-theory predictions: coral communities exhibit community similarity values that are far more variable, and lower on average, than the neutral theory can produce. Empirical community similarities deviate from the neutral model in a direction opposite to that predicted in previous critiques of the neutral theory(6-9). Instead, our results support spatio-temporal environmental stochasticity as a major driver of diversity patterns on coral reefs(10,11).","James Cook Univ N Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",156,10.1038/nature04534,2006

In addition to self -recruitment, larval import from outside the local area is required to sustain most populations, although these population subsidies are very limited in particular systems.

Here we compare the negative impacts of enhanced predation with the positive impacts of reduced fishing mortality on parrotfishes inside reserves. Because large-bodied parrotfishes escape the risk of predation from a large piscivore (the Nassau grouper), the predation effect reduced grazing by only 4 to 8%. This impact was overwhelmed by the increase in density of large parrotfishes, resulting in a net doubling of grazing. Increased grazing caused a fourfold reduction in the cover of macroalgae, which, because they are the principal competitors of corals, highlights the potential importance of reserves for coral reef resilience.","Univ Exeter, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Sch Biosci, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England; Perry Inst Marine Sci, Jupiter, FL 33477 USA; Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA; Amer Museum Nat Hist, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat, New York, NY 10024 USA; Univ W Indies, Dept Life Sci, Kingston 7, Jamaica; Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Affairs & Policy, Miami, FL 33149 USA; Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA; Univ Arizona, Bur Appl Res Anthropol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; Cranfield Univ, Inst Water & Environm, Silsoe MK45 4DT, Beds, England",503,10.1126/science.1121129,2006

It remains unclear, however, whether this diversity - stability relationship can be scaled up to regional scales, or to longer timescales(5). Without empirical validation at larger scales, the implications of the diversity - stability relationship for both ecology and long-term conservation strategies cannot readily be resolved. Here I show that in biogenic reefs, ecological stability is related to taxonomic diversity on million-year timescales. The higher the mean reef diversity in a particular time interval, the smaller the change in skeletal density, style of reef building and biotic reef types in the subsequent time interval. Because the relationships apply to a wide spectrum of disturbance regimes and reef types, these results support the hypothesis that species richness itself promotes ecological stability(3). Carbonate production by reefs, while closely correlated with reef diversity without temporal lag, is not stabilized by reef diversity over these long timescales. This suggests that ecological stability and productivity may be decoupled in natural ecosystems.","Humboldt Univ, Museum Nat Hist, D-10115 Berlin, Germany",53,10.1038/nature03152,2005

The related anomalous oceanic southward heat transport arises from a zonal density gradient in the subtropical North Atlantic caused by a fast wave-adjustment process.

Thus, a better understanding of how broad- as well as local-scale processes affect species diversity and richness is increasingly becoming a central focus in modern community ecology(6-9). Here, in a study of unprecedented geographical scope, we show significant regional and local variation in the species richness of coral assemblages across an oceanic biodiversity gradient. The gradient that we sampled extends 10,000 km eastwards from the world's richest coral biodiversity hotspot in the central Indo-Pacific(10). Local richness and the size of regional species pools decline significantly across 15 islands spanning the gradient. In addition, richness declines across three adjacent habitats ( reef slopes, crests and flats). In each habitat, a highly consistent linear relationship between local and regional species richness indicates strong regional enrichment. Thus, even on the most diverse coral reefs in the world, local coral assemblages are profoundly affected by regional-scale processes.

Here we present seasonally resolved proxy records using corals from the northernmost Red Sea, which record climate during the last interglacial period, the late Holocene epoch and the present. We find an increased seasonality in the temperature recorded in the last interglacial coral. Today, climate in the northern Red Sea is sensitive to the North Atlantic Oscillation(4,5), a climate oscillation that strongly influences winter temperatures and precipitation in the North Atlantic region. From our coral records and simulations with a coupled atmosphere - ocean circulation model, we conclude that a tendency towards the high-index state of the North Atlantic Oscillation during the last interglacial period, which is consistent with European proxy records(6-8), contributed to the larger amplitude of the seasonal cycle in the Middle East.","Univ Bremen, DFG Forschszentrum Ozeanrander, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; Univ Bremen, Fachbereich Geowissensch, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; Heidelberger Akad Wissensch, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; Univ Jordan, Marine Sci Stn, Aqaba 77110, Jordan; Yarmouk Univ, Aqaba 77110, Jordan",175,10.1038/nature02546,2004

Here we present high-resolution analyses of skeletal Sr/Ca and O-18/O-16 ratios for a giant fossil Diploastrea heliopora coral that was preserved in growth position on the raised reef terraces of Espiritu Santo Island, Vanuatu, in the southwestern tropical Pacific Ocean(17). Our data indicate that sea surface temperatures in Vanuatu were on average 4.5 +/- 1.3 degreesC cooler during the Younger Dryas event than today, with a significant interdecadal modulation. The amplified annual cycle of sea surface temperatures, relative to today, indicates that cooling was caused by the compression of tropical waters towards the Equator. The positive correlation in our record between the oxygen isotope ratios of sea water and sea surface temperatures suggests that the South Pacific convergence zone, which brings O-18-depleted precipitation to the area today, was not active during the Younger Dryas period.","Inst Rech Dev, Noumea, New Caledonia; Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; Univ Arizona, NSF, Arizona AMS Facil, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; Inst Rech Dev, F-93143 Bondy, France",68,10.1038/nature02506,2004

Here we show that released coral mucus efficiently traps organic matter from the water column and rapidly carries energy and nutrients to the reef lagoon sediment, which acts as a biocatalytic mineralizing filter. In the Great Barrier Reef, the dominant genus of hard corals, Acropora, exudes up to 4.8 litres of mucus per square metre of reef area per day. Between 56% and 80% of this mucus dissolves in the reef water, which is filtered through the lagoon sands. Here, coral mucus is degraded at a turnover rate of at least 7% per hour. Detached undissolved mucus traps suspended particles, increasing its initial organic carbon and nitrogen content by three orders of magnitude within 2 h. Tidal currents concentrate these mucus aggregates into the lagoon, where they rapidly settle. Coral mucus provides light energy harvested by the zooxanthellae and trapped particles to the heterotrophic reef community, thereby establishing a recycling loop that supports benthic life, while reducing loss of energy and nutrients from the reef ecosystem.","Max Planck Inst Marine Microbiol, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; Florida State Univ, Dept Oceanog, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Dept Benth Ecosyst, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany; Yarmouk Univ, Aqaba, Jordan; Univ Jordan, Marine Sci Stn, Aqaba, Jordan",325,10.1038/nature02344,2004

Here we show that this assumption is incorrect on the basis of analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear genes. Pervasive morphological convergence at the family level has obscured the evolutionary distinctiveness of Atlantic corals. Some Atlantic genera conventionally assigned to different families are more closely related to each other than they are to their respective Pacific 'congeners'. Nine of the 27 genera of reef-building Atlantic corals belong to this previously unrecognized lineage, which probably diverged over 34 million years ago. Although Pacific reefs have larger numbers of more narrowly distributed species, and therefore rank higher in biodiversity hotspot analyses(3), the deep evolutionary distinctiveness of many Atlantic corals should also be considered when setting conservation priorities.","Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Naos Marine Lab, Balboa, Panama; Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Ctr Marine Biodivers & Conservat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Iowa, Dept Geosci, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; Univ Florida, Florida Museum Nat Hist, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Genet, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; Acad Sinica, Inst Zool, Taipei 115, Taiwan; Akajima Marine Sci Lab, Okinawa 9013311, Japan",186,10.1038/nature02339,2004

Juvenile coral reef fish often inhabit mangroves(2-5), but the importance of these nurseries to reef fish population dynamics has not been quantified. Indeed, mangroves might be expected to have negligible influence on reef fish communities: juvenile fish can inhabit alternative habitats and fish populations may be regulated by other limiting factors such as larval supply or fishing(6). Here we show that mangroves are unexpectedly important, serving as an intermediate nursery habitat that may increase the survivorship of young fish. Mangroves in the Caribbean strongly influence the community structure of fish on neighbouring coral reefs. In addition, the biomass of several commercially important species is more than doubled when adult habitat is connected to mangroves. The largest herbivorous fish in the Atlantic, Scarus guacamaia, has a functional dependency on mangroves and has suffered local extinction after mangrove removal. Current rates of mangrove deforestation are likely to have severe deleterious consequences for the ecosystem function, fisheries productivity and resilience of reefs.

We extracted a prominent nickel compound displaying the same absorption spectrum as the nickel cofactor F(430) of methyl-coenzyme M reductase, the terminal enzyme of methanogenesis(12); however, the nickel compound exhibited a higher molecular mass than F430. The apparent variant of F430 was part of an abundant protein that was purified from the mat and that consists of three different subunits. Determined amino-terminal amino acid sequences matched a gene locus cloned from the mat. Sequence analyses revealed similarities to methyl-coenzyme M reductase from methanogenic archaea.

Differential acclimation by corals in different places complicates this further(3,7,8).

Although explanations for biodiversity patterns are still a matter for intense debate(5), they have often been considered to be scale-dependent(6,7). At large geographical scales, biogeographers have suggested that variation in species richness results from factors such as area, temperature, environmental stability, and geological processes, among many others(5,7-14). From the species pools generated by these large-scale processes, community ecologists have suggested that local-scale assembly of communities is achieved through processes such as competition, predation, recruitment, disturbances and immigration(5-8,15,16).
